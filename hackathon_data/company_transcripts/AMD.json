Thank you for standing by. And welcome to the AMD third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I'd now like to turn the conference to our host, [Technical Difficulty]. Ma'am, you may begin.","Ruth Cotter","Thank you, and welcome to AMD's third quarter earnings conference call. By now you should have had the opportunity to review a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary and slides. If you have not reviewed these documents, they can be found on AMD's website at ir.amd.com.","Participants on today's call are Lisa Su, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Devinder Kumar, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","This is a live call and will be replayed via webcast on amd.com.","I'd like to take this opportunity before the call begins to highlight several dates for you. Matt Skynner, our Corporate Vice President and General Manager of the Graphics Business Unit will present at the UBS Technology Conference on November 18 in California. Devinder Kumar will present at the Credit Suisse Technology Conference on December 3, in Arizona; and at the Raymond James IT Supply Chain Conference on December 8 in New York.","Mark Papermaster, our Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer will present at the Barclays Global Technology, Media and Telecommunication Conference on December 8 in San Francisco. Our fourth quarter quiet time will begin at the close of business on Friday, December 12. And lastly, we expect to announce our fourth quarter earnings results on January 20, 2015.","Please note that we are now reporting two new financial segments beginning the third quarter. Computing and Graphic segment, primarily include desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, discrete GPUs and professional graphic; and the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, primarily include server and embedded processors, dense servers, semi-custom SoC products, engineering services and royalties.","Additionally note, that non-GAAP financial measures referenced during this call are reconciled to most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in the press release and CFO commentary, which are posted on our websites at quarterlyearnings.amd.com.","Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date, and as such involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.","Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's earnings press release and CFO commentary for more information. You'll also find detailed discussions about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC, and in particular AMD's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 28, 2014.","Now, with that, I'd like to hand the call over to Lisa. Lisa?","Lisa Su","Thank you, Ruth, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. I am pleased to be here on my first earnings call as CEO. In addition to covering our quarterly results, I also want to use this opportunity to provide some details on my initial priorities and the steps we are taking to continue transforming and strengthening AMD.","Our third quarter results highlight the progress we have made in diversifying our business, as we delivered our fifth straight quarter of non-GAAP profitability. While our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment had a strong quarter, we did face some challenges in our Computing and Graphics business due to ongoing weakness in the consumer PC market.","We know what we need to do to improve performance going forward and are taking the appropriate actions. So let me give you some more color on each of the segments.","Our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment delivered sequential and year-over-year revenue and operating profit improvement. We had strong embedded processor revenue growth and secured multiple new design wins across our priority markets. For instance, Arista, a leader in software-driven cloud networking, began ramping production of new switches powered by our embedded G-Series SoC.","Our customers also began ramping a number of new retail in educational digital signage wins in the third quarter. We also started sampling our first embedded ARM SoC in the quarter, and at ARM's TechCon Conference we demo the industry's first ever 64-bit ARM-powered network function virtualization solution. The demo won best in show software product and is a great example of how our leadership, ARM and x86 offerings are generating increased interest from telecom and networking customer.","Our work to lead the industry's transition to 64-bit ARM servers also gained momentum in the quarter. After ceding Opteron A-Series development kits with key ecosystem partners earlier this year, we expanded availability to software developers and system integrators. We continue building out the 64-bit ARM Server Ecosystem in advance of system launches expected next year.","This quarter we also had public demonstrations of community versions of Red Hat's Fedora and SUSE'S OpenSUSE 64-bit ARM Linux operating systems running Oracle JDK and enterprise-class Java platform on our upcoming Opteron A-Series SoC. Based on the wide-spread availability and silicon status of our Seattle development board, we are also seeing a number of our partners and customers using the AMD platform as their lead ARM 64 development vehicle.","The highlight of our quarter was in our strong semi-custom business, where we shipped a record number of units for our game console customers. Q3 will be our peak unit shipment quarter for the year, as Microsoft and Sony prepare for the holiday season.","And relative to our new semi-custom design win pipeline, I am very pleased to announce that we have secured two new wins, accomplishing our goal to close one to two semi-custom wins this year. These new semi-custom SoCs are expected to deliver combined total lifetime revenue of approximately $1 billion over approximately three years.","Design work for these opportunities has started and we anticipate first silicon revenue in 2016. Although, I can't go into details on the customers or the specific products, it is important to note that we are diversifying our semi-custom business beyond gaming.","These wins also mark another significant milestone for us, as one of the wins is our first 64-bit ARM-based semi-custom design, building on our growing ARM 64 momentum in the embedded and server markets. Our semi-custom design win pipeline remain strong and we continue to have good opportunities to deliver future growth for this important part of our business.","Now, turning to our Computing and Graphics segment. The Computing and Graphics business remains very important to us and is an evolving area of the company, where we have started a substantial amount of work to transform and strengthen this business.","Earlier this year, we laid out several important objectives to improve the financial performance of this segment. These include expanding in the commercial client market, improving our mix in consumer notebooks, gaining share in professional graphics and increasing component and AIB channel sales.","We've met our goal to double our commercial client design wins from last year, and are pleased with the initial progress we are making to build a richer mix in our PC business. New commercial client offerings from Dell, HP, Lenovo have started ramping, resulting in approximately a 50% increase in our commercial APU shipments from the second quarter.","We also improved our notebook APU mix in the quarter, as our Kaveri processors ramped in mobile design wins and our higher-end mobile processor unit shipments increased nearly 50% from the second quarter. Mobile discrete GPU unit shipments also increased from the second quarter, as new design wins entered production.","And earlier today, Apple announced a number of new iMacs powered by our Radeon GPUs. Included in the wins is the new 27-inch iMac with 5K retina resolution, which highlights the ongoing move to higher resolution displays. This trend plays well to our strengths in discrete GPUs.","And in the professional graphics market, we believe this remains an area where we see the opportunity for ongoing growth. In the third quarter, channel sales increased sequentially and we secured several new design wins with Dell and HP that will reach market early next year.","Now, turning to the desktop processor and graphics performance in the quarter. Although, we increased overall desktop processor unit shipments from the previous quarter, our performance in the component and graphics channel was weak. We saw sell-out momentum slow, particularly in China, and believed there was some downstream inventory build in the quarter, causing our distributors to be more cautious managing their inventories. We are committed to these markets and have started taking actions in conjunction with our channel partners to improve sell-through in the coming quarters.","Now, let me turn to some of my initial priorities and our strategic actions. As I said on our call last week, the strategy we outlined two years ago remains the right one for AMD. But to strengthen AMD and better position us for success, we must take some targeted restructuring actions to align our investments and resources with our highest priority opportunities.","These actions are not about how we manage the business in the short-term, but about how we reengineer the company for the long-term, and position both of our Computing and Graphics and Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segments for profitability and growth.","As part of the plan, you will see us continue to invest in the talent and skills required to develop our world-class technologies and products, as well as add new skills in areas like software and application engineering that will help us drive into new markets.","While we will protect our engineering investments, we will also take the opportunity to streamline parts of the organization to better align them with our highest priority opportunities. Reducing headcount is never easy, but these actions will enable us to become a stronger and more nimble company.","In summary, as I step into the role of CEO, I firmly believe we are one of the few companies with the market position and capabilities to deliver world-class technologies and great products that will lead the industry forward.","My near-term priorities are very clear. First and foremost, we will focus our energy on delivering great products. We will also ensure that we continue to deepen our customer relationships and continue to simplify and streamline our organization. We have a unique opportunity in front of us, and I am very much looking forward to the future.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our third quarter financial performance, fourth quarter guidance and details of our transformation plan. Devinder?","Devinder Kumar","Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. We continue to make progress on our strategic transformation and delivered non-GAAP profitability for the fifth straight quarter, despite a weak consumer PC environment. We managed operating expense, reduced inventory and shipped record quarterly semi-custom SoCs.","Now, let me cover the specifics of the third quarter. Revenue was $1.43 billion, flat sequentially and down 2% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower chipset and GPU sales, partially offset by increased sales of semi-custom SoCs. Third quarter revenue included $27 million related to the licensing of technology.","Gross margin was 35%, flat from the prior quarter and included $27 million or a 2% benefit from revenue related to licensing technology. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the third quarter were $428 million, down $3 million from the prior quarter. For the fifth quarter in a row, non-GAAP operating expense to revenue ratio was 30% or better.","Non-GAAP operating income was $66 million and non-GAAP net income was $20 million, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.03, calculated using 785 million diluted shares. Third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets of $3 million. Interest expense, taxes and other expenses were $46 million in the quarter.","During the quarter, AMD entered into interest rate swap transactions. These transactions effectively converted $250 million of AMD's fixed rate 6.75% senior notes due 2019 to a variable interest rate. Based on current interest rates, we anticipate quarterly interest savings from these transactions to be approximately $1 million beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014. The remaining $250 million portion of AMD's 6.75% 2019 debt as well as all other term debt on the balance sheet has a weighted average fixed interest rate of 7.1%.","Adjusted EBITDA was $133 million, down $4 million from the prior quarter. And for the trailing four quarters, adjusted EBITDA was $574 million.","Now, turning to the business segments. Computing and Graphics revenue was $781 million, down 6% sequentially, primarily due to lower chipset and GPU sales. Computing and Graphics operating loss was $17 million compared to a $6 million loss in the prior quarter. This was driven primarily by lower revenue.","Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $648 million, up $35 million or 6% from the prior quarter, primarily due to an increase in sales of our semi-custom SoCs. Operating income was $108 million, up from $97 million in the prior quarter, primarily driven by higher sales of our semi-custom SoCs.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance totaled $938 million at the end of the quarter, essentially flat from the prior quarter. Inventory was $897 million, down $63 million or 7% from the prior quarter. We remain focused on maintaining appropriate levels of inventory and plan to manage inventory levels down, again in the fourth quarter.","Debt as of the end of the quarter was $2.2 billion. Accounts payable at the end of the third quarter was $498 million, down slightly from $511 million in the second quarter. We had negative free cash flow of $11 million in Q3 2014, an improvement of $40 million from the prior quarter.","As Lisa stated in her opening remarks, we are working to build a stronger and diversified company, as we continue our strategic transformation. We are ensuring, we have the right resources deployed in concert with the evolution of our business model, as we right size and strengthen our Computing and Graphics segment resources in line with the market realities of today, and further invest in our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment focused on our growth opportunities.","To that end, we are taking actions and implementing operational efficiencies, while also reducing headcount and further streamlining our global real estate assets. We expect to reduce our workforce by approximately 7%, with the majority of actions completed by the end of the fourth quarter.","We anticipate aligning our real estate foot print starting in the fourth quarter and continuing into the first half of 2015. Associated with these actions, we expect to record restructuring and impairment charges of approximately $57 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, consisting primarily of severance-related charges and approximately $13 million in the first half of 2015, primarily related to real estate actions.","We expect to make cash payments of approximately $34 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and approximately $20 million in the first half of 2015, associated with these actions. Based on these actions, we anticipate operational savings, primarily in operating expenses of approximately $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and approximately $85 million in 2015.","Now, turning to the outlook and guidance for the fourth quarter of 2014. AMD expects revenue to decrease 13% sequentially, plus or minus 3%, due to lower semi-custom revenue and a weak consumer PC environment. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 35%.","Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $385 million, below our prior 2014 quarterly operating expense guidance range of approximately $420 million to $450 million, in line with expected revenue and savings from our restructuring and transformation initiatives.","Interest expense and other to be approximately $46 million. Inventory is expected to decrease from third quarter levels. And finally, free cash flow is expected to be positive in the fourth quarter; and for the full year 2014, negative in the range of $200 million to $250 million, including the impact of the $200 million special payment to GlobalFoundries earlier this year.","In summary, while there is more work to be done, as we continue our transformation journey, we are positioning AMD to execute our current set of strategic transformation priorities, while focusing on sustainable profitability and driving enhanced returns for our shareholders.","With that, I'll turn it back to Ruth. Ruth?","Ruth Cotter","Thank you, Devinder. Operator, we'd be happy for you to poll the audience for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","My question is on the restructuring that you are doing. Which areas will you deep prioritize, given this restructuring? Do you think you can afford to focus on the same number of markets or is it time to narrow the focus?","Lisa Su","Relative to the restructuring, we have been looking at all of our markets across the company and all of the things that we do, both from an engineering side and a go-to-market side. From this standpoint, we are very much protecting the key engineering skills and key engineering investments.","But as we look across our businesses and as we diversify from being a pure PC company into much more diversified business, and we found opportunities to streamline particularly on the Computing and Graphics side as we look at our go-to-market and our infrastructure around that. So as always, I think it's difficult to take these actions, but these will certainly be important steps to help us simplify and operate more efficiently.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And as a follow-up, I understand the semi-custom wins should start helping you in 2016, and maybe it's a little early to talk about 2015, but I am just curious that if the semi-custom only heads from 2016, what happens in 2015 as you continue to see a somewhat sluggish PC and graphics market? How do you plan to manage the business in that timeframe? And maybe as part B of that question for Devinder, are there any implications, if the PC and graphics market stays the way it is, are there any implications on your wafer supply agreement with GlobalFoundries?","Lisa Su","Let me take the first part of that, Vivek, and Devinder will take the second part. So relative to how we're managing the business, I mean certainly if you look at it, we've been very focused on improving the operational performance of the business. I think we have made strong progress in 2014, and we will continue to do that in the coming years.","In terms of the markets that we're in, the semi-custom wins are exciting and important for us, that they are part of our long-term growth strategy. We also have growth that we highlighted in embedded and professional graphics, and some of our other growth markets. And in the traditional PC market, the key areas for us are really changing the mix of the product and focusing on the places where we're more differentiated.","So commercial is an early start for us, and we're starting from a low base, but we have seen progress there and we expect that into 2015 as well, as well as some of the work that we're doing in the graphics space, like you saw with the Apple win today. So again, I think from overall market standpoint, we know where to focus and we're going to continue focusing on those areas that play to our differentiation.","Devinder Kumar","Thank you, Lisa. Vivek, good question on the business. I think what you have seen even over the last couple of years, as we had the difficulties in the 2012 timeframe that we have shown the ability to manage the business, in line with revenue to manage the operating expenses, focus on the areas that Lisa talked about as priorities, and continue to diversify our revenue, but at the same time, making sure that we protect our investments in the core IP and technologies, which is really going to fuel the future growth and long-term profitability of the company.","Your question on GlobalFoundries, and whether from an inventory standpoint, we're on track. You know, very much on-track, as we end the third quarter here. And as I said in the prepared remarks, we'll be on-track to meet those obligations, inventories down Q2 to Q3, and I expect that it will be down in Q4, despite the lower revenue between Q3 and Q4.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies","Devinder, maybe for you, couple of the income statement questions. The 13% decline that you expect for next quarter, you mentioned I think computing and the embedded business, both declining, is that split evenly between the two? Is it both business you expect to decline about that much or will it be weighted one or the other? And when you look at your OpEx savings you expect of $85 million next year, is that a $21 million a quarter or does that kind of ramp through the year, and you exit the year something higher than that?","Devinder Kumar","The first question, I think if you ask me overall from a viewpoint of the decline of 13%, given the peak quarter that we had in semi-custom is weighted towards the semi-custom. So you know as you look at our segment reporting, which has changed effective this quarter, Computing and Graphics and the Embedded, Enterprise and Semi-Custom, I would say, that the decline quarter-on-quarter is more weighted towards the EESC segment as opposed to Computing and Graphics.","And as far as the OpEx is concerned, I can share with you Q4. I'll tell you that in Q4, as you look at Q3 to Q4, the decline in OpEx is about $40 million-plus. Some of it comes from the transformation initiatives that we've been working on. Lisa talked about simplification of our structures within the company. We're getting closer to the customer.","We also have actions that we took today, and that's going to save about $9 million within the quarter. We had some product tape outs in Q3 that don't repeat in Q4, that's some savings. And overall, we've been very focused on managing the OpEx in line with our revenue expectations and revenue profile, and that is where the rest of the savings are coming from.","You tried to get the 2015, and maybe asked the question about that, but I am not prepared to get into the 2015 discussion at that point. We can have a little bit more of a discussion about 2015, when we come to the Q4 earnings call in January.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies","And then if I may one more on the computing side. In 2013, the computing business was running around $900 million a quarter, and this year it's $800 million a quarter, it's just running lower than that, exiting this year. And given, Lisa, that you seem to be streamlining more on the computing side, should we think about this business as being an x growth business or a low-double digit growth or a low-single digit growth or a low single-digit decline business?","Lisa Su","So Mark, your question on the Computing and Graphics segment, look it's a very important for us. I think it's a little early to talk about longer term guidance for the business. Clearly, our goal is to strengthen it and improve its profitability, particularly in the couple of areas that I talked about earlier.","Devinder Kumar","And I'll add, Mark, I think you talked about the numbers in terms of the revenue ranges in the 2013 and 2014, you're exactly right. If you look at the detail that we have provided, whereby we have not only provided the new segment information for Q3, 2014, but also recast the historical data, Computing And Graphics on the one hand and Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom on the other. And if you go look at the year-to-date numbers, 2013 nine months versus 2014 nine months, the revenue is down, as you observed from the $900 million to the $800 million-plus, 13% down.","But the losses, there were loses in the first three quarters of 2013, it was close about $90 million and if you add up the last three quarters of 2014, its more in the $20 million range, so we have improved the financial performance, and the action that we are taking today and the focus that we are bringing in the Computing and Graphics business is obviously focused on continuing to improving the financial performance, in line with whatever revenue expectations there are.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Wong of Wells Fargo.","David Wong - Wells Fargo","Devinder, do any of the restructuring actions that you're planning bring cash into AMD? For example, might you get any meaningful amounts of cash on real estate to other asset sales?","Devinder Kumar","They might, David. They might. I think some of the restructuring actions, as I talked in the prepared remarks, 2015 first half, and as you can imagine most of the assets in our case, we don't own the assets, but there are some that we own, those projects are in flight, too early to tell whether they'd bring in cash and how much they bring in, but at least we quantify in terms of this first half of 2014, what the actions would be of getting out of the space, because we know the obligations are, whether they are sitting on our balance sheet or the lease expenses, so too early to tell. And I think as we get to the 2015 timeframe, because the headcount actions have to be taken before we can act on the real estate part as you can imagine, so it will be in the 2015 timeframe that I'll able to share more detail on that.","David Wong - Wells Fargo","And Lisa, you have touched on this, but just to ask the question explicitly, will the restructuring involve discontinuing future development of any specific product line that you know about at the moment?","Lisa Su","Yes, David, I think that's really around streamlining our investments and ensuring that we're on the highest growth opportunities. So relative to discontinuing a particular product line, we are not discontinuing a particular product line at this time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Hans Mosesmann from Raymond James.","Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James","Lisa, can you comment about your larger competitor talking about normal seasonality going into the end of the year. You're saying that there is significant consumer weakness. What's driving the different view of the markets and are you just losing market share?","Lisa Su","Sure, Hans. So I think the way to think about the market, because when we look at the market, there is certain segmentation. So when we look overall, clearly the strength in the PC market has been around commercial primarily. When we look at consumer, it's still choppy and we see, it's weak, and there is a competitive dynamic in there.","From our standpoint, we tend to have more exposure to some of the emerging geographies, particularly in the channel. And so we are seeing some weakness in China, in the emerging geographies. Relative to our MNC business or the large OEMs, I think that business is relatively as expected. So I think it's our view. Our segmentation in the PC market is different from our competitors. And if you look at normal seasonality, I think Q4 is usually a high sellout quarter, but from a selling standpoint, it is typically a little bit down.","Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James","And if I can follow-up with one more. Your competitor on the tablet side has a very ambitious and aggressive strategy, and they're in some cases perhaps giving away these chips for free in tablets. Is that impacting perhaps some part of your business, maybe it's the low-end of the consumer PC market.","Lisa Su","Yes. Hans, we have discussed this a little bit before. I think it is definitely true that there are some aggressive competitive dynamics, particularly in the low-end. Couple of quarters ago, we made a decision about how we're managing that. We are certainly competing in the low-end, but we are not going after business that's not profitable. And so if you look at the mix of our business, you see our ASPs up in mobile. And the reason for that is we're actually making good progress at the higher end of the product stack, and at the very, very low-end, we are choosing not to go after a bad business.","Operator","Our next question comes from JoAnne Feeney of ABR Investment Strategy.","JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy","I was hoping you could give us a little bit more detail on the graphics business, particularly the consumer graphics business and how that works out for you in the third quarter? And what you're seeing into the fourth, because typically the fourth is a bit seasonally stronger. Wondering, if that's what you're seeing or if the new offerings out by your competitor has given you a more cautions outlook on this quarter?","Lisa Su","So overall in graphics, I think we've made progress in certain segments of the graphics market, certainly in mobile for sure. And you see that with some of our OEM wins, as well as the recent announcements. On the AIB channel, it has been a little bit weak for us, and if you recall AIB started in the first quarter very strong around cryptocurrency. And then as we went into the second quarter with some of that the market dynamics there, it was weaker.","Relative to the competitive environment, I would agree that Q4 tends to be a stronger seasonal month, a seasonal quarter for our graphics, as we go into the holiday season. We've certainly adjusted to some of the competitive dynamics, and we have made some positioning changes as well as some new marketing activities that you will see from us in the fourth quarter.","JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy","So does that suggest that you're looking for it to be up or to be down in terms of consumer graphics in the fourth quarter?","Lisa Su","Well, when we look overall at the CG business, we've said that it will be down. I think there are certain segments within the business that will be up, based on the seasonality.","JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy","And then, Devinder, I'm curious about your latest move with the interest swaps. Obviously, it's a benefit shorter terms to switch to variable interest rates to that $250 million. But it seems like you're taking a risk here with the U.S. economies improving, that interest rate will be going up. And if I heard you correctly, you don't get a benefit from that until the end of the 2015 year. So do you plan to be able to pay that back before that risk really becomes a concern, or are you assuming that these marketing interest will stay low for long enough for you to payback eventually?","Devinder Kumar","Thank you, JoAnne. That's a good question. I think overall from the way we have crafted that interest rate swap transaction, there is a benefit at the way we have set it up to the tune of about $1 million a quarter. And what you talked the increased interest rates from some standpoint, there is no risk for the life of that that we have on the balance sheet for $250 million of the fixed rate, that we have on the 2019. We have presently swapped that out. And there is some hedging that gets into place. I can get into the details offline with you to go ahead and explain to you how it works, and the confidence level that we have from a view point of where we sit with that particular that transaction.","JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy","And then if I could sneak in one last question. With the reorganization of the two segments, I was hoping perhaps you could give us a sense of how gross margins compare across those segments? And also how perhaps operating expenses compare. The Compute and Graphic segments obviously are showing loses for most of the last eight quarters -- sorry, most of the last five quarters or six quarters. I am wondering whether that's attributable to gross margin difference or if it's really the R&D expense on the C&G side that's driving that and where you think that's going to go over time?","Devinder Kumar","I think it's a combination of factors, so I am not going to provide, JoAnne, unfortunately granularity from a gross margin at a segment level. We do share the revenue and the operating income. The thing that you probably know based on the business model for the semi-custom in particular, we have been clear that that is below the corporate average from a gross margin standpoint, but that's where you get the benefit from the NRE model of how products are designed together with the customers, how we get the funding for those products.","And then when go to silicon production, there are no sales and marketing dollars. There is a little bit of warranty on an ongoing basis, and the G&A is essentially a fixed cost, so you scale the revenue, the operating margin benefits, and that's why you have seen the results as you observed for the EESC segment whereby there is profitability at the 15%, 16%, 17% of operating income level.","As far the Computer and Graphics, you are right. If you look back the last five quarters, two of the five quarters we made money, and three quarters we lost money. Revenue is down as the previous question observed and that's what we are doing in terms of managing for long-term profitability at the company-level and redistributing the resources and redeploying resources potentially from one segment to another, but by the same token, managing them in line with the revenue expectations for the future.","JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy","Quick follow-up to that. Just wondering whether there is room in the C&G segment to make the kinds of cuts you need to make to turn that profitable, or if the competitive pressure under is constraining your prices so much and the demands on the research side are so much that you really in a difficult spot to cut those cost and raise that operating profit. Can you speak to how you would get that done?","Devinder Kumar","Yes, I can address that and I'll ask Lisa to address how we are -- this is really methodical. I think you probably recall, and maybe that's what you're referring to couple of years ago when the PC market went down pretty dramatically in the 2012 timeframe, we did reset restructure. And I would say having participated in both of those at the CFO level, those were more across the board, but these are very targeted and very methodical, protecting the core technology, as I talked about, and making sure that we do not in any way disrupt the future technology and making sure that the long-term growth at the company level is assured and protecting the technology. Lisa, you want to comment on that.","Lisa Su","Yes, JoAnne, this is a really important point. So when you look our strategy and the model that we are trying to build, it really is around developing leadership IP, so that's core CPU and graphics IPs, it's actually used across both segments, and that's very critical and it's being entirely protected in this restructuring action.","When we look specifically in the Computing and Graphics business, relative to the overall infrastructure that was built around these two businesses, the businesses are smaller than they were before, and so there is significant opportunity to streamline how we operate, how we go to market, and just the overall infrastructure that we have. So from an R&D standpoint, very clear that those are the most important investments, and ones that will fuel long-term growth in both segments. And so those will continue. And we do believe that there is opportunity to streamline in the operational side.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ian Ing from MKM Partners.","Ian Ing - MKM Partners","First question is in GPU inventories. Looks like the AIBs aren't really reselling or refurbishing their returns. Looks like they don't want to put excess product into the market, so I read the filings, they're grading implications on price protections as the AIBs try to monetize their inventories?","Lisa Su","Maybe I'll start with that Ian. So very relative to the AIBs, we work closely, very closely with all the channel partners. I did mention that there was some cautiousness in the distribution channel, as we were going through the third quarter. Part of that was just, the new products from both ourselves, as well from our competitor. We see that fourth quarter is typically a stronger quarter for the AIB channel and we would expect that the distributors will have the inventory on hand necessary for the holiday season.","Ian Ing - MKM Partners","There's not an excess level of price protection?","Lisa Su","There is nothing unusual.","Ian Ing - MKM Partners","And then, Lisa, more of a high level question. So now that you're the CEO of the AMD, I mean what should we think of as your imprint on the company, the strategy is not changing too much? Is it really executing to the product roadmaps?. Is there any sort of senior management you'd like to bring on board to help meet your goals?","Lisa Su","Well, I think, Ian, thanks for that question. The strategy is something that I believe very much in, it's something that we put together as a leadership team, and it really is about taking the technology assets that we have, as a company, and applying them to higher growth segments. So at a high level that is absolutely what we're doing.","Now, relative to what I would like to do, I am really going to focus on the leadership products and differentiation. I mean that is the core of what I think will make us successful, as a company, as well as our deeper customer relationships and the simplification we've talked about. I think there is a lot of opportunity here. This is a multi-year transformation that we're going through, but relative to some of the technology bets that we are making, they will payoff in the next couple of years. So I think you'll see perhaps a little bit more focus on the technology and the products.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Rolland from FBR Capital Markets.","Christopher Rolland - FBR Capital Markets","First, Fairchild -- I apologize we're in the middle of a fire drill. Fairchild said today that Microsoft really had ordered all their components ahead of 4Q that build and that they really weren't reordering. So APUs might be a different story here, I understand that, but are there any sort of shadows in the story there? Are you seeing a pretty marked sort of decrease in builds in 4Q?","Lisa Su","Thanks for the question Chris. So relative to Microsoft, they are actually the game console customers. Our lead times are fairly long for the APUs. And so we synchronized our forecast with the customer forecast in that time period. So we don't see anything unusual. I think our expectations for the fourth quarter are very much in line with the customer demands.","Christopher Rolland - FBR Capital Markets","And then also if we could talk about the Bitcoin mining situation, I guess you guys said you thought that that was going to be a one quarter event. Basically, we're sort of wondering here, we do see some channel inventory out there, some parts on eBay and stuff like that in the grey market. Would you say that you guys are still through that or would you say that there is maybe a few more quarters to go here?","Lisa Su","Yes. I think Chris, if I just take the overall channel, both the desktop and GPU channel; I think there is some dynamics in there. I think the Bitcoin or the cryptocurrency thing really started in the second quarter, flowed through the third quarter. There were some used or secondhand cards that were out there in the market. I would say that what we're looking at now is really working through some of the product positioning as we go into the fourth quarter. So with most channel inventory issues, it does take a couple of quarters to work through, and we are working through those. But I think relative to the cryptocurrency, I think that's lesser of a factor at this point in time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Ramsay of Canaccord Genuity.","Matt Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity","Lisa, I wanted to ask a quick question about sort of the foundry side with 14-nanometer launching from your competitor. You guys are in a position now for a period of time, where some products could be a couple nodes behind. I just want a comment on how that's affecting you, when your interface with customers and partners, and how you think that set you up in a competitive position for the next several quarters until FinFET gets launched as your foundry partner?","Lisa Su","Sure, Matt. So on the technology side, it's certainly important and we are doing active designs in FinFET for sure. From our product differentiation standpoint, so if you look at the APUs, it tends to be more of an architectural statement versus a process technology statement.","So with our launch of Kaveri and the amount of compute cores that we have on Kaveri, I think that's something that has been attractive to the market. And as we go into our next generation APUs in 2015, they will have added features and functions, some of our heterogeneous software architecture as well.","So I think the net of it is, clearly the technology is important, and we're designing in FinFET and they are going to be an important node for us, as we go forward. But there are many things that we're doing on the architectural and power management side to ensure that we provide differentiated products.","Matt Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity","And then, as a follow-up, you talked about the gaming business being down in 4Q, which you had talked about last quarter. And I think the stance, obviously, it's too early to guide a lot of things for next year, but I think the stance the company had taken is as distribution of the gaming console sort of ramped from your partners there that that business should grow on a year-over-year basis next year. Maybe you could talk to the detail that you can about, what can we expect in the gaming business for seasonality in Q1 and what next year looks like on an annualized basis, and the fact that the new wins that you've just got are 2016 revenue?","Lisa Su","So let me try to frame it in this way, it is a little bit early to talk about 2015 revenue in units. What I will say is that from what we see, the gaming console business looks strong. We just had a one of our partners Microsoft launch in China, and that looked like it was successful.","I think everything that we see is shaping up to be a solid holiday season. Relative to 2015 seasonality, it is a consumer business, and so we would expect that the first half would be lower than the second half. And we'll have to see how all of that shakes out through this holiday season.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Cassidy of Stifel Nicolaus.","Dean Grumlose - Stifel Nicolaus","This is Dean Grumlose calling in for Kevin. Thank you very much for taking my call. But could you comment on your traction in profession and server GPU markets?","Lisa Su","Sure. So the professional graphics market is important to us. I think in this quarter we certainly improved in the channels, we had some quarter-over-quarter growth in the channel in professional graphics as well as some new design wins from several of the large OEMs. I think in general, professional graphics is a longer sell cycle than some of the consumer graphics. And so we're spending quite a bit of effort in both business development and software and ISB development to ensure that we grow that business on a go-forward basis.","Dean Grumlose - Stifel Nicolaus","And as a follow-up, going forward what you view as your key differentiating advantages in various GPU markets?","Lisa Su","Again, I think on the graphics side, it is about graphics, performance, performance per watt, and compute capability. So there is certainly a competitive market, but from our standpoint I think we have very competitive products. And as in professional graphics, the ISB certifications are quite important. It's really about the investments in those ISB certifications.","Operator","Our next question comes from Srini Pajjuri from CLSA.","Srini Pajjuri - CLSA","Lisa, just wondering the game console business, as we look into the next year, when do your prizes typically get reset? And also are you expecting any process node transitions in 2015? And in general, I am just trying to understand, how I should think about the overall profitability versus this year, assuming that units are relatively flat?","Lisa Su","Sure. So the ASPs that we negotiate with the customers are negotiated in advance, so they are certainly booked into our business model. There are ASP declines year-on-year. And then relative -- I'm sorry, you said, relative to operating profits, I think we will of course work very hard on ensuring that we get the cost reductions relative to the ASP reductions as well. So I think from overall game console business, we view it as a very strong business for us.","Srini Pajjuri - CLSA","And then are you expecting any process node migrations in this business?","Lisa Su","There will be process node migrations. And we'll talk about them at the appropriate time.","Srini Pajjuri - CLSA","And then you mentioned the two new design wins, they are expect to ramp sometime in 2016. Is there a way to think about the overall opportunity relative to what you are getting from the semi-custom business today?","Lisa Su","So the two new semi-custom design wins that we talked about, relative opportunity around $1 billion over a three-year lifetime. The reason we really like these types of businesses, obviously, is because they're sticky once you win them, the recurring revenue is there. I view that there is quite a bit of opportunity for us in semi-custom. The pipeline is strong. It's across a variety of different markets, and it's an area that we will continue to differentiate given our IP and SoC design capability.","Srini Pajjuri - CLSA","And do you expect the margin profile and the profitability to look similar?","Lisa Su","So if you look at the overall business, I think we would like to talk about the EESC business versus specific design wins. And the EESC business you can see has good profitability and we will continue to work on improving that.","Ruth Cotter","Operator, we would like to take two more questions, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael McConnell of Pacific Crest Securities.","Michael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities","I just wanted to clarify on the graphic side with your sell-through commentary, and the on-board market and the inventory commentary, is that a market issue or is that an AMD issue?","Lisa Su","So relative to the AIB channel, I thought the commentary, the third quarter was slow, some of that was market and some of that was sort of our product positioning. As we look into the fourth quarter, we think the market will be a normal quarter and certainly we view the opportunity to improve in the AIB channel.","Michael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities","And you just clarified, you did say channel inventory will be -- you're expecting channel inventory overall for the market to be normalized by Q4?","Lisa Su","No. I think what we said was that there was nothing unusual in the channel inventory relative to the third quarter. The previous question was about whether the distributors would have enough inventory to support the fourth quarter. Relative to overall channel inventories, our goal is to normalize channel inventories over the next several quarters.","Operator","And our final question comes from Sanjay Chaurasia from Nomura.","Sanjay Chaurasia - Nomura","Lisa, I have question on servers. As you have laid out your strategy, and the fact you have moved servers into semi-custom business, could you talk about how would you defend for my estimates more than $0.5 billion in server revenue. It does look like based on this cost cuts, there's not much significant focus on improving x86 performance as it relates to servers. So what happens to this business? Is it defendable or does it continue to go down?","Lisa Su","So maybe let me talk about servers a little bit more generally, and then we can clarify some of the specifics. From a general standpoint, the server market is a big large TAM, and so we are certainly interested in growing in servers. From where we are today, our product portfolio in x86 is several years old. And we are certainly looking at updating that over the next couple of years. And then as we look at the opportunity in server, particularly in dense server, I think there's an opportunity for both x86 and ARM. And so we are going after the newer markets in server versus some of the traditional enterprise.","Sanjay Chaurasia - Nomura","And as a follow-up, if I exclude your gaming business and semi-custom, what would the mix of x86 and ARM in your semi-custom design wins? And also the two new design wins you talked about, are these x86-based or ARM-based?","Lisa Su","So if you are asking about the semi-custom revenue today, the semi-custom revenue today is all x86-based. As we move forward, we believe ARM will become more important in that business. And then specific to the two new semi-custom opportunities one of them is in ARM and one is an x86.","Ruth Cotter","Operator, thank you. That concludes today's call. If you could wrap it up, we'd appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your attendance. You may now disconnect.

Lisa?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all of those listening in today. First quarter revenue increased 18% from a year ago to $984 million based on growth across both of our business segments. Gross margin also improved driven largely by the success of our recently launched Ryzen CPUs.","I am pleased with our first quarter product execution and improved year-over-year financial results, which demonstrate the revenue growth and gross margin expansion potential with our strong set of new products.","Looking at our Computing and Graphics segment. We delivered our fourth straight quarter of double-digit percentage year-on-year revenue growth. Strong demand for Ryzen CPUs and improved GPU sales resulted in CG revenue increasing 29% from the year ago period.","CG revenue declined 1% sequentially, which was better than normal seasonality, as significant growth in desktop processor sales driven by the first month of Ryzen CPU sales largely offset seasonal declines in GPU and notebook APU sales.","Solid demand for our family of premium Ryzen 7 processors, including our flagship Ryzen 7 1800X offering, which is the industry's highest performance 8-core CPU drove our highest desktop processor revenue in more than two years. Ryzen CPUs have been consistently ranked among the top-selling processors at global etailers and retailers, and press reviews and end-user sentiments have highlighted the strong performance and value proposition.","In early April, we launched our enthusiast-class Ryzen 5 processors and received overwhelmingly positive reviews that demonstrate our multi-threaded leadership and unmatched value proposition. The Ryzen CPU partner ecosystem also continues to strengthen.","We have seated more than 300 software developers to support their work optimizing for Ryzen CPUs and have already seen double-digit performance gains across a number of top-tier gaming titles. Last week, the first Ryzen-based OEM gaming desktops were announced, and we continue the rapid rollout of Ryzen-powered systems with additional launches planned for major OEMs later this quarter.","In Graphics, GPU sales increased by a strong double-digit percentage from a year ago based on growth across all of our product lines. The ramp of Polaris-based notebook design wins drove increased mobile GPU sales, while our desktop growth was led by improved channel sales.","In early Q2, we launched four new Radeon RX 500 GPUs, featuring our Polaris architecture that deliver improved performance. These new mainstream GPUs provide a compelling solution for the millions of gamers looking to upgrade their PCs to support advanced display technologies and deliver optimal gaming experiences.","We also saw higher professional graphics revenue from a year ago, driven by expanding channel sales and growing data center wins as we continue to increase our GPU compute footprint with leading cloud service providers.","We remain on track to launch the first products from our next-generation Radeon Vega family later this quarter. Vega is a forward-looking architecture that combines a revolutionary memory subsystem, next-generation compute engine, advanced pixel engine and new geometry pipeline to dramatically improve performance and energy efficiency for the next generation of GPU workloads. Customer excitement is building as we focus on bringing significant competition to the high-end GPU space across the PC gaming, professional design and GPU compute markets.","Turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Revenue increased 5% from a year ago driven by the latest game console offerings from Sony and Microsoft and our third straight quarter delivering year-on-year embedded revenue growth. We see solid demand for our latest FinFET based semi-custom offerings in 2017, including the planned holiday launch of Microsoft's 4K-focused Project Scorpio console featuring a new AMD SoC.","On the data center front, in March we demonstrated that our upcoming Naples server CPU would offer more cores, I\/O, and memory bandwidth when compared to the highest-end dual socket x86 server CPUs currently available, resulting in better performance across multiple workloads.","Naples platform development work continued to accelerate in the quarter. We are in the final stages of preparation in advance of launch and are very pleased with the status of our silicon and customer engagements. We have now seated thousands of Naples processors across an extensive set of OEMs, end users and partners, and remain on track for our first Naples products to launch this quarter.","In closing, we started 2017 delivering significant year-on-year revenue growth and margin expansion based on solid product execution and strong market and customer reception to our new leadership products.","Our focus in 2017 remains on launching our Naples server CPU with broad customer, partner and ecosystem support. Naples is the first step in our long-term plan to deliver a leadership data center product roadmap; complementing the success of our mainstream Polaris-based GPUs with our high-end Vega GPUs; extending our Zen core into the mainstream desktop and premium notebook markets with the launches of our Ryzen 3 CPUs and Ryzen mobile APUs in the second half of the year; and expanding our participation in the fast-growing market for GPU compute with the launch of Radeon Instinct Accelerators mid-year.","2017 is an important year for AMD, and we are well-positioned for solid revenue growth and margin expansion based on bringing performance, choice and innovation to an expanding set of markets. I look forward to discussing more about our long-term strategy at our Financial Analyst Day later this month.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our first quarter financial performance.","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone.","We had a good start to 2017, as we expanded gross margin, increased revenue 18% year over year to $984 million, and reduced losses year over year.","Computing and Graphics segment revenue increased 29% year over year, driven by the launch of our high-performance Ryzen desktop processors and our strengthened GPU product portfolio. Our Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom segment revenue increased 5% from a year ago.","Let me provide some specifics for the first quarter of 2017. Gross margin was 34%, up 2 percentage points year over year, driven by a higher overall mix of revenue from our Computing and Graphics segment and a richer product mix within that segment due to Ryzen desktop processor sales.","Operating expenses were $364 million compared to $332 million a year ago. The increase is due primarily to R&D investments in Graphics and our Server business. Net licensing gain from our server JV with THATIC was $27 million compared to $7 million a year ago.","Operating loss was $6 million in the first quarter of 2017, a significant improvement from a $55 million loss a year ago. First quarter net interest expense, taxes, and other was $32 million, down from $41 million year over year, primarily due to a lower overall interest rate and a lower debt balance.","Net loss was $38 million, or loss per share of $0.04, calculated using 939 million shares of common stock as compared to a net loss of $96 million or $0.12 a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was $28 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of negative $22 million from a year ago.","Now turning to the business segments, Computing and Graphics revenue was $593 million, up 29% year over year and down 1% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher Ryzen desktop CPU and graphics processor sales. The better than seasonal quarter-over-quarter decrease was due to lower mobile and graphics processor sales, largely offset by Ryzen desktop processor sales.","Computing and Graphics business segment operating loss was $15 million, a significant improvement on the loss of $70 million year over year, primarily due to higher revenue.","Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom revenue was $391 million, up 5% year over year, primarily due to higher semi-custom SoC sales. Operating income was $9 million, down from $16 million a year ago, due primarily to higher server-related R&D investments, largely offset by an increase in the THATIC JV licensing gain.","Turning to the balance sheet, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled $943 million at the end of the quarter compared to $1.26 billion at the end of 2016. The sequential decrease was driven primarily by the timing of sales and cash collections, debt interest payments, and increased inventory. Inventory ended at $839 million compared to $751 million at year end in support of the ramp of new products and increased semi-custom SoC sales in the second quarter.","Long-term debt on the balance sheet was $1.41 billion, down from $1.44 billion at year end, primarily due to debt reduction activities. The principal debt amount was $1.73 billion, down $34 million from the prior quarter as a result of debt reduction actions.","Turning to our outlook for the second quarter of 2017, which is a 13-week quarter, we expect revenue to increase 17% sequentially plus or minus 3%, non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 33%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $370 million, licensing gain associated with our server JV to be approximately $20 million. Non-GAAP interest expense taxes and other to be approximately $30 million; and inventory to be down sequentially.","For 2017, we now expect revenue to increase low double-digit percentage on a year-over-year basis and CapEx to be approximately $140 million, including the capitalization of production mask sets beginning in Q1 2017. Additional 2017 guidance can be found in the CFO Commentary document.","In closing, we remain focused on continuing to improve our financial performance on the strength of new product introductions, continued financial discipline, and ongoing strategic investments in the business. I look forward to sharing further details on our longer-term prospects at our upcoming Financial Analyst Day on May 16.","With that, I'll turn it back to Laura. Laura?","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you, Devinder. Operator, we're ready to begin the Q&A portion of our cal.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question today is coming from Matt Ramsay from Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Good afternoon, thank you. Lisa, I wonder if you could spend a little bit more time talking about the Ryzen desktop launch, how you would characterize it's gone so far. Maybe any kind of quantification you could give on revenue for the one month you had in the first quarter and then for the second quarter guidance and then anything that might have limited sales in the quarter. We heard of things about shortages of motherboards from a few suppliers, et cetera. So any additional commentary around the Ryzen launch would be really helpful. Thank you.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Sure. Absolutely, Matt. So look, we're very pleased with how the Ryzen launch went. It was a big launch for us. We did Ryzen 7 first early March and then Ryzen 5 here in the middle of April. All of the feedback that we've gotten so far from both our customers and from end users has been very strong. I think the value proposition is very strong at both the Ryzen 7 eight-core devices, as well as the Ryzen 5 four and six-core devices.","Relative to how it performed in the quarter, actually, it performed as we expected. So with a global launch, we were reaching many distributors and many channel partners, and I think that's gone well. We did see some early shortages in terms of motherboards, and that was our motherboard partners ramping their supply in line with our CPU supply, but that was really dissipated after the first couple of weeks.","So nothing out of the ordinary there. So we feel really good about where it is. I think the important thing is as we go into the second quarter, we not only have the channel sales, but we also have the major OEMs that will be launching their systems in the second quarter. So I think that's the next piece of the Ryzen launch for us. But overall, I would say it went quite well.","Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thank you for that. And just as my follow-up question, I wanted to ask a little bit about gross margin. Lisa, you talked in your prepared remarks about \u2013 as the new product roll out across the different parts of the company through the year that that margin should expand.","Yet with a full quarter of Ryzen, you're guiding gross margin down slightly sequentially. I know the new gaming console business starts to ramp for the upcoming season in that quarter as well. So any kind of puts and takes around that gross margin because for some reaction I got from investors tonight, that sequentially down gross margin surprised a couple of folks. So any clarification there would be helpful. Thanks.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Absolutely, Matt. So if you look at our gross margin progression given the mix of our business, clearly, we made actually very nice progress year over year. So if you look at Q1 2017 compared to Q1 2016, we expanded margin by 2 points, and that was really on the strength of Ryzen.","When you look sequentially, because of the mix of our business, game consoles were at the lowest point in the first quarter. And there will be a ramp of game consoles going into the second quarter. So the relative mix of the business sees more gaming consoles in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. So that's the reason for the sequential guidance. But again, if you look year over year, Q2 2017 to Q2 2016, you'll see again a nice margin expansion as a result of the strength of the products.","Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thanks, Matt.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you. Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Yes. Our next question today is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I want to follow on the Ryzen launch, and not only in the quarter, but also in the guide, and specifically, any color you could provide on the channel inventory, how that exited the quarter and what your plans are for adding or boiling down some of that inventory in 2Q?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Sure, Ross. So as we go into the second quarter, we certainly are adding both the Ryzen 5 in addition to the Ryzen 7. So if we look at the forward guidance, up 17% quarter-on-quarter, that is driven by additional Ryzen, as well as a semi-custom ramp that I just talked about. We are early in the ramp. Everything that we see is \u2013 we're getting positive reception throughout the ecosystem and we're going to continue with go-to-market activities, and as I mentioned, the OEM component of that will kick in in the second quarter.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And I guess as my follow-up, two quick ones for Devinder. The inventory went up sequentially by about 11% \u2013 12% and you had an explanation for that, but if I recall right, you thought it would be flat. So I'm just wondering what changed there? And then with the share count, I think as you approach breakeven, the share count might change. So any color you could give us on the share count going forward will be helpful as well. Thank you.","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Sure, and you are right about the inventory. The ramp of new products and especially the ramp of the semi-custom product revenue that Lisa just talked about was the main reason for the high inventory. We also had the opportunity in the quarter to purchase wafers in Q1 ahead of Q2 sales and took advantage of the opportunity leading to the inventory at the $839 million.","On the share count, you're right. As we go ahead and look at the share count on a basic share basis, we have 939 million shares, but there are two parts to it. If we were profitable, the warrants that we issued to Mubadala last year as part of the WSA, those get converted depending on the stock price, and that would be in there depending on profitability.","And then the second thing is a convertible. Obviously, as you know how that works, is if converted, then obviously those would be included in the share count. Otherwise, it will depend upon dilution or not, depending on the EPS.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Thanks for the opportunity to ask a question. Perhaps a question for Lisa, one for Devinder. Lisa, can you talk about the \u2013 whether or not you're getting the right capacity and expected yields from your foundry as Ryzen launches?","And for Devinder, as your customers take higher ASP processors in the game console business, I seem to remember when you originally launched, I thought that the \u2013 maybe the initial yields or maybe the initial margins were not as good, but the margins improved over time. And I'm wondering if, assuming I remembered properly, if that's something else that we should be thinking about as your customers take the higher ASP game console processors? Thank you.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Sure, Mark. So on your first question, relative to the margins and how those look, I think they are \u2013 the yields are as expected. So both the 16-nanometer and the 14-nanometer have done really well. And so, in terms of the new product ramp, the yields are as expected and per our margin structure.","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","On the Semi-Custom, Mark, as far as the margins are concerned, we are referring to the operating margins, I think we are pretty pleased where we are. And it's a mix for us in terms of transition on some of the products \u2013 for example, the Sony PlayStation Pro that we launched sometime last year. And obviously, the older game console that we launched in 2013. The ASPs do come down over time; although, we're able to manage the cost down, too; and therefore, offsetting the ASP decline.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","And, Mark, maybe just to finish off the comment, I think, to your question, I think, we feel pretty good about our cost structure. We're always going to continue to try to reduce the cost structure over time.","But in terms of the margin expansion story, as we go through the year, it's going to be about the mix of business. And as we get into the higher ASP, stronger product portfolio and that ramps to a larger piece of the business, that will be the margin expansion story.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Excellent, thank you.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from David Wong from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Can you give us some idea of where Vega is? Does it focus on the price point above Polaris, or does it provide a refresh also within the lower price points where currently you have Polaris?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Absolutely, David. So Vega is really a new architecture. So it is focused on the price points above Polaris. We expect Vega to be a broad product for us that will go across the gaming segment, the professional workstation segment, as well as GPUs in the data center. And we will be launching products across all of those segments with the Vega architecture in the next couple of months. So the Polaris refresh for us is the RX 500 series that we launched just a couple weeks ago. And that is what we would use in those mainstream price points in 2017.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. And could you give us any specifics on when in the second half you expect to launch notebook and desktop processors with Zen cores and integrated graphics?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","So we are on track to launch the rest of the Ryzen portfolio in PCs. We'll launch Ryzen 3 earlier in the second half, and then we will launch Ryzen mobile towards the holiday cycle for the second half.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. For the first one, I'm a little surprised, on the C&G business, you said sales were roughly flat sequentially give or take. You said Ryzen sales made up for seasonally lower GPUs and notebooks, which should have materially low margins. I'm just very surprised that the loss in the business barely got any better. Can you give us some indication for where Ryzen margins are today versus the products that they're replacing and give us a little bit of color on why the CPU margins didn't actually get much better given the ramp?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Stacy, maybe let me start and see if Devinder has some comments to add. I think certainly the Ryzen gross margins are substantially better than the legacy portfolio. So I think that is true. I think when you look at the sequential \u2013 there was 1% sequential decline, and there was a $7 million or $8 million sequential improvement in operating loss. There was also some additional R&D in that segment as we're ramping up both product expenses as well as some sales and marketing and go-to-market expenses in the quarter. So overall, it was as we expected. Maybe, Devinder, do you want to add to that?","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","I think the other thing I would add, Stacy, is on the Ryzen piece of it. The ASPs are better. The margins are better. And as you can see from a segment standpoint, we made some pretty good progress year over year from a viewpoint of the operating loss getting better, the results getting better year over year from a segment standpoint.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Got it. For my follow-up, I guess maybe it hints at the OpEx a little bit, but it looks like you're capitalizing your masks now. You took your CapEx guide up by $60 million for the year. You went from $80 million to $140 million. Is that all the mask? And if so, were those mask costs actually in OpEx before? And if that's the case, have you actually taken your OpEx guide effectively up by $60 million for the year?","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","I think two parts to it. First of all, on the mask piece of it, you're right. The mask cost, as our product development becomes profitable and the mask costs have gone up, especially with the latest technology, we went ahead and decided to capitalize the production mask set costs. From a geographic standpoint, the mask costs, whereas they would have been in R&D previously, would be sitting on the COGS side of the P&L and therefore amortized in the COGS side related to the production of the units. And the difference in the CapEx guidance, $80 million to $140 million, is primarily the mask cost.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Got it. So what does that mean for I guess how you guys are tackling gross margin now if they would have been directly in the COGS before and now they're being capitalized over time? Is that a margin \u2013 I guess effective margin boost even though it's not anything on the cash side? And if so, I guess the same question, then why are margins down this quarter?","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","I think margins, as Lisa said earlier, year on year we are pretty pleased with the progress, 2 percentage points up. Q2 is a mix of the business, and then as we get through the end of \u2013 to the second of the year, we'd see with the full impact of, not just the Ryzen product, but also launching the Naples product that's coming up at the tail end of Q2 and then again the second half of 2017.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Stacy, maybe I just want to clarify because I want to make sure that we were clear. So the masks were in OpEx and now they're going to be capitalized as they go into production, so they weren't in COGS before.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So you have effectively taken your OpEx up then, because it doesn't look like your OpEx is coming down by the same amount, so you're spending more?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah. I think it really is a full-year statement, and I think it's a recognition of, as we transition from 14-nanometer to 7-nanometer, 7-nanometer masks are substantially more expensive than 14. So I don't think you can exactly put it the way you put it. But overall, I think what we're trying to do is basically as the mask sets become more sizable on the production level to capitalize them.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thanks, Stacy.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I actually wanted to just continue with the discussion on margins. So would the margin profile then as we exit the year, should we expect margins \u2013 gross margins to trend up for the second half versus what you reported, i.e., or what you're guiding to, i.e., would that be the lowest point for the year? And then I had a follow-up.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah. So, Ambrish, I think you should expect that we will expand margins as we go through the year. We do have this mix effect between Semi-Custom and new product revenue. But certainly, our exit velocity, as we exit the year, we should see \u2013 when you compare year-on-year sort of Q4 2017 to Q4 2016, you should see the margin expansion.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then, for my follow-up, in your full year guide, on the top line, now, you're giving a \u2013 you're quantifying it versus what you had before. I just wanted to get a little bit more clarity or to the extent you guys can share on the assumptions that you have baked in there for the various segments. Thank you.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah. So the full year guide is low double-digit revenue growth, 2017 to 2016. I think, given our product portfolio being very much influenced by the PC \u2013 the Ryzen and PCs, Vega for GPUs as well as Naples from a server standpoint, we expect that the Computing and Graphics segment will be \u2013 will grow more so than the EESC segment overall on a year-over-year basis, just given some of the consumer markets move faster than some of the data center and server markets.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Hans Mosesmann from Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Hans C. Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Hey, Lisa, can you give us a sense of the introduction of Naples into the second half and next year? Is that going to reflect or be similar to what you're doing with Ryzen 7 and then 5 and then 3? And I have a follow-up.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Sure. So, look, we're really pleased with where we are with the Naples program right now. Overall, from a performance standpoint, the product and the customer engagements is going as we would expect. We will launch here in the second quarter. So we'll start some low volume of revenue shipments during the second quarter that will ramp gradually into the second half of the year.","And so, overall, I think, that is how the server outlook will be. I think I have said before and I would still say that the server market has a longer design win to revenue conversion cycle. And so we would expect it to take a couple of quarters for us to ramp the Naples product over time. But you should see a number of customers announcing what AMD platforms over the next couple of quarters.","Hans C. Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.","Great. And then, as a follow-up on the server side, what's the strategy in terms of positioning of the product? I think traditionally, in most cases, it's been more like a me-too product at the low end of the market. What's the strategy here if you can share that with us? Thanks.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","So we believe we're highly differentiated with Naples in the sense that we have more cores. We have more memory bandwidth. We have more I\/O than our competition. So for certain workloads, I think, Naples is going to do very, very well, certainly, in the cloud as well as in certain HPC workloads and big data workloads that can use all of that memory and I\/O bandwidth.","We will be talking more about the positioning of Naples and the key workloads, as we go through the next couple of months prior to launch. But, certainly, we feel that it's, again, like Ryzen, on the strength of the Zen core, we have a very, very strong foundational product. And now it's about making sure that we help our customers get to market.","Hans C. Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah, guys. Can you hear me?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes, John. Go ahead.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Lisa, can you hear me?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes. Go ahead.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah. Just quickly, Lisa, given that mix now is becoming quite important in trying to understand gross margin, I'd be kind of curious, what percent of your Compute business in the March quarter was based on Ryzen? And I guess, if you assume that all of the transitions to Ryzen eventually \u2013 had that occurred in the March quarter, can you give us an understanding of how much better gross margins would have been? And then I have a follow-up.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","All right, John, that might be hard for me to answer very specifically, but let me give you the high-level view. So we started selling Ryzen on March 2, and a good piece of it was \u2013 basically for us positioning into the distributors. We take revenue on a sell-out model and so you should think about \u2013 although, we shipped a number of Ryzens, we didn't necessarily revenue them all in the quarter just given that we're on a sellout model for our revenue recognition.","In terms of where we are in the transition, Ryzen, non-Ryzen, we still have a long ways to go. I mean, the way we should think about it is Ryzen 7 was at the very high-end. We're going to \u2013 Ryzen 5 has started. We have Ryzen 3 that will come next, and then we have the entire mobile portfolio as well.","So it will take us through this year to really transition the majority of the product over to Ryzen. I think everything that we've seen, the ASP uplifts are definitely very beneficial. And so, we're pleased with sort of the pricing that we're commanding for the product and the reception for the product. So I think it's just \u2013 it will take us a couple of quarters to transition the overall portfolio over to Ryzen.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Lisa, as a follow-up to that, I know you guys are coming up with an Analyst Day next month and some of these targets might change. But to the extent that your old gross margin target was sort of 36% to 40%, I'm just kind of curious. To what extent can you get to that 38% midpoint just by moving your current market share mix towards Ryzen? And to what extent does getting to 38% or above imply either market share gains in the Compute business on the desktop, notebook side or on the server side? How do I think about that dynamic?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","So the long-term guidance, 36% to 40%, I think we have multiple ways of getting there. Certainly, on the PC side, it is not anticipating that we gain a significant amount of share over our historical numbers. So I think the idea on the PC side is, again, I think 2017, a large percentage of the margin story is around PCs.","I think as you go into 2018, you'll see a larger percentage of that be in servers. But to the fundamental question, I think we feel good that the mix dynamics are there, the product is strong enough to command the right ASPs that we can get to the long-term margin targets several different ways.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking my question. Lisa, for my first one, back to Ryzen. When I look at your Q2 outlook, it's going up about $170 million or so sequentially. And when I look at the last few years, generally, Q1 to Q2, just the console side has gone up over $100 million or so. So is it fair to assume that Ryzen perhaps is contributing something in that $50 million, $60 million, $70 million? And if that is the case, how does that compare to your original expectations? Did they change throughout the quarter because of whatever pricing actions that you might have taken? Just that $50 million, $60 million, $70 million, if this is right, is this a run rate number for Ryzen or how should we put this in the context of what Ryzen can be as it becomes a bigger part of your portfolio?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Sure. So without commenting on the exact numbers between Semi-Custom and Ryzen, I think, it's fair to say that the Semi-Custom business will have a reasonable ramp in the second quarter as will Ryzen.","In terms of relative to our expectations, it's actually very close to our expectations of what we expected the ramp rate to be, as we're going into this new segment. As I think I've mentioned on one of the previous questions, we don't expect to be at peak run rate in the second quarter. I think we will be continuing to ramp Zen-based product in the PC business throughout the year, as we bring more and more SKUs online.","And so, I think, the second quarter will certainly be higher than the first quarter. And we expect the second half to be higher than what we're seeing in the second quarter, as we ramp more and more SKUs, as more OEM platforms come online.","As you guys know, the PC business tends to be a very back-half loaded business. So, as we get into back-to-school, the retail segments and holiday, you would expect that both channel and OEM PC sales to benefit from the stronger product portfolio.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And as my follow-up, how do you feel about the PC gaming market for this year? I know just near term there have been some concerns about excess GPU inventory in China. Are those concerns based on fact, or are they just perception? And have you seen anything abnormal in the demand or supply for PC GPU product in any region or any customer segment? Thanks.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","On the GPU side, we actually haven't seen anything abnormal. We normally see the seasonality going from Q4 to Q1 that sales go down. We saw something very normal to that. From an inventory standpoint, we think it's normal to maybe even slightly lean because we were going through a transition from our 400 Series to 500 Series. So we see the gaming segment as healthy.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And any comment for the full year? Last year \u2013 last actually couple of years have been quite strong in PC gaming. I know you probably may not quantify it. But just how do you feel about the overall PC gaming market? Do you think the trends persist in terms of both unit and pricing expansion this year?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","From what we see, I think we feel good about the gaming segment overall. Graphics continues to be a strong segment. For us, it's not just the channel business, but it's the ramp of our OEM business. So we have a number of new OEM systems that are also ramping here in the first half of the year.","As it relates to ASPs, we are excited with the launch of Vega that will see a significant improvement in our ASPs, just given our current presence in the high-end segment of the GPU market. So yes, overall, I think, we feel good about the market.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thanks.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, thanks for taking my question. Actually, it's two related ones. I just wanted to go back to the OpEx in terms of, not only is it up sequentially, but then you're getting extra from the move of the mask sets. Can you just talk about where the OpEx dollars are going? And if it's in fact servers, can you just talk about the spend required to get that to market?","And then just I wanted to clarify on the expense, it should hit gross margin, so can you just talk about 7-nanometer as a whole and timing as those would come through? Is the CapEx back-end loaded when you're doing the $140 million? And then can you just talk about the impact to the gross margin with the higher 7-nanometer spend not hitting gross margin?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Maybe let me start on the OpEx and then have Devinder comment on the second piece of the question. So on the OpEx, we are making targeted investments in several different areas. The key areas are in GPUs and server, and it's both on the R&D side as well as on some go-to-market. So from our standpoint, these are very strong products. We want to make sure that we have enough customer resources to help our customers ramp into production. So I think they're targeted investments, but as we've been in the past, we'll be very prudent with where the OpEx goes. And then relative to the...","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","I think the CapEx, you asked about the front and back end. I think it's pretty balanced. Maybe it's about 40\/60 first half\/second half, the $140 million, but it's pretty balanced.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Then just in terms of the impact to gross margin as the mask sets roll through?","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","They're all contemplated. I think we've had a lot of discussion on the gross margin improvement year over year and sequentially, and Lisa had referenced about improving gross margin as we go through the year. And the move of the expenses from the OpEx side related to the mask cost capitalization to the COGS side of it, which impacts gross margin is all contemplated in that gross margin improvement.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, thanks.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you. Operator, we have time for two more questions, please.","Operator","Certainly. Our next question is coming from Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thank you. I wonder if you could talk about what the CPU mix looks like over the course of the year. And you've talked a lot about the Ryzen ramp, but what's happening to the older products? Do you see a long tail on that, or is there a coexistence between the two product portfolios? Or are you rotating everything to Ryzen on a faster basis?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","So, Joe, the way to think about that is for the Ryzen 7 and a good portion of the Ryzen 5, we really didn't have a competing product in that segment, so it's really additive. We've actually added Sam [Samsung] to our CPU market coverage. The legacy products will continue in the market. They will certainly continue through this year, and that's all contemplated in the model. So we feel that they're very complementary products and different geographies moves at different rates. We have still a significant installed base of motherboards out there from our previous generation, so we'll keep supporting both products.","Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then as you've talked about getting better Ryzen penetration over the course of the year, how do you think about Intel's new products in the back half and they've talked about sort of a 15% performance per clock improvement on their new 14-nanometer product. Is that contemplated in your guidance and how are you thinking about the Ryzen products stacking up against that?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","So we're very pleased with where the Ryzen product is positioned now. We think, from a value proposition standpoint, performance, performance per dollar, it's very strong. We obviously have other products we're going to be launching throughout the year to ensure that we have strong product positioning throughout the year.","And I think the more important thing, Joe, and we'll talk more about this at our Financial Analyst Day is we have a long-term roadmap, whether you're talking about PCs or GPUs or servers to ensure that we continue to refresh our product plans and our product roadmaps over time. So I think we feel good about where we are positioned today, and we're going to ensure that we continue to roll out products to strengthen that positioning over time.","Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Chris Rolland from Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Rolland - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in there. I wanted to ask about the staggered launch to the major PC OEMs. Was that like just a modest supply constraint on the rollout or, if not, then why not just launch to the enthusiasts and the major PC OEM market together? And do you plan to do the same on Ryzen 5 and 3?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes, Chris. So there was no particular supply constraint. I think it's more of the ebb and flow of the market. When you think about the channel market or the DIY market, you can basically introduce your product any time during the year. The OEMs have a very set cycle. They typically launch new products in Q2 for the back-to-school season. And so that was just the timing of when the OEM platforms were ready.","And then, again, when you're launching so many different SKUs \u2013 I think, launching Ryzen 7 first, then Ryzen 5, then Ryzen 3 \u2013 was absolutely our plan to make sure that we hit all of the logistics and stuff on plan. But, overall, like I said, nothing different than what we expected. I think we're pleased with where the overall launch is, and we'll be rolling out many more products over the coming quarters.","Christopher Rolland - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Great, thank you very much.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you.","Lisa T.

My name is Huey, and I'll be your conference operator for today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to AMD's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] After the speakers' remarks, you will be invited to participate in a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Ruth Cotter, Vice President of Investor Relations for AMD. Please go ahead.","Ruth Cotter","Thank you, Huey. Welcome to AMD's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. By now, you should have had the opportunity to review a copy of our earnings press release and CFO commentary. If you have not reviewed these documents, they can be found on AMD's website at quarterlyearnings.amd.com. Participants on today's conference call are Rory Read, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Devinder Kumar, Senior Vice President, Corporate Controller and Interim Chief Financial Officer; and Lisa Su, our Senior Vice President and General Manager, Global Business Unit, and she will be present for the question-and-answer portion of the call. This is a live call and will be replayed via webcast on amd.com.","I'd like to take this opportunity to highlight a few dates of note for you. Rory Read will present at the Cr\u00e9dit Suisse Technology Conference on November 27; Devinder Kumar will present at the Raymond James Conference on December 10; and our fourth quarter earnings quiet time will begin at the close of business on Friday, December 14.  Lastly, we intend to announce our fourth quarter and fiscal 2012 earnings on January 17, 2013. Dial-in information for that call will be provided in mid-December of this year.","Please note, non-GAAP financial measures referenced during this call are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the recent CFO commentary posted on our website at quarterlyearnings.amd.com.","Before we begin today, let me remind everyone that today's discussions contain forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information. You will also find detailed discussions about our risk factors and our filings with the SEC and in particular, AMD's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2012.","Now with that, I'll hand the call over to Rory. Rory?","Rory P. Read","Thank you, Ruth. Our third quarter financial performance fell significantly short of our expectations. We understand the dynamics behind the shortfall, and we are taking decisive actions to address the core issues. To help return the company to profitability, we also announced a restructuring plan designed to strengthen AMD's competitive positioning and reduce our expense structure. I will cover that plan in greater detail shortly, but first I wanted to discuss our third quarter results.","Broader macroeconomic issues are impacting consumer PC spend. OEMs are also taking a cautious approach to managing inventory in advance of the Windows 8 launch, and tablets continue to grow as a consumer device of choice. As a result, we face a very challenging selling environment, especially in the lower end of the consumer client space.","Yet, against this backdrop, we saw a continued consumer adoption of our Trinity APU in the quarter. Trinity notebook unit shipments increased more than 70% sequentially and accounted for nearly 1\/3 of our total notebook shipments in the third quarter. Although Trinity is targeted at mainstream price points, Ultrathin notebooks featuring the low-power APU are also competing effectively at higher system price points. As a result, we believe we gained share in the $600 to $799 retail notebook price band globally in the third quarter. More than 125 AMD-based systems are expected to launch with Windows 8, including tablets and several new Ultrathins. While we look forward to the introduction of Win 8, the fourth quarter will continue to be challenging, and we do not expect PC market conditions to improve for several quarters.","Our graphics business performed in line with our expectations. Despite market softness, we continue to see improvement in our desktop discrete channel business, and game console revenue increased. Our industry-leading graphics technologies remain a cornerstone of our end-end product strategy, and we plan to further invest in our graphics business to drive differentiation and future growth across the entire product portfolio.","Now let's turn to the changes in the market and how they are affecting our business and the steps we are taking to address them. Shortly after joining AMD, I talked about the fundamental changes occurring in the PC industry. These trends are occurring now at an even faster rate than previously anticipated. We underestimated the speed of change in our industry, and we expected to have several years to transform the AMD business. But we must implement our transformation on a more aggressive time line.","Here is what we will do. First, we are restructuring our business and building a more efficient operating model. This reset will put in place a business model capable of delivering consistent profitability at lower breakeven revenue points.  Second, we must diversify beyond the traditional PC market and become a leader in fast-growing and adjacent markets where we can differentiate and create leadership.","Our restructuring will simplify our product development cycles without jeopardizing our ability to innovate or deliver products in a timely manner. We will do this primarily by building reusable IP blocks that will help lower development costs and improve our speed of execution. The restructuring plan is expected to lower our expense base by approximately 25%. This will result in an annualized cost savings of approximately $190 million. A large portion of these savings will come from a headcount reduction of approximately 15%. These are difficult but necessary steps to ensure our plan has the right scale and scope to address the market and competitive challenges we now face.","In addition, we are resetting to a new business model designed to deliver breakeven results with approximately $1.3 billion of quarterly revenue. We expect to hit this level by the third quarter of 2013.","As we move through 2013, we will see the results of our work with a more efficient business and a portfolio of powerful new products. There is strong customer interest in our next-generation offerings. Design win momentum is solid and we see opportunity to regain share in the 2013. We already have working silicon for many of our new 2013 products in-house, including our next-generation 28-nanometer Kabini APU, which is the successor to our highly successful Brazos platform and our first true SoC design. We are making good progress with the bring up of Kabini, which remains on track to launch in the first half of next year.","Our long-term strategy will rebalance our business towards faster-growing segments of the market. Today, approximately 85% of our business is focused on the legacy PC portion of the market projected to have slowing growth over the next several years. We intend to drive 40% to 50% of our portfolio to faster-growth markets where our IP is the key differentiator.","We have strong opportunities in 3 fast-growing areas.","","First, in server. The dense cloud market is one of the fastest-growing parts of the data center market. Our long-term path to success is in providing customers with disruptive technologies and choice, just as we did when we brought 64-bit computing to the mainstream server market with AMD 64. We will look to leverage AMD's full suite of processor and graphics IP, third-party processor cores and SeaMicro's innovative supercompute fabric to deliver differentiated solutions with industry-leading performance-per-watt.","Second, our low-power APUs, graphics IP and reusable design blocks give us a distinct advantage to build semi-custom APUs for new embedded markets. We are focused on growing our share in targeted embedded markets. These include communications, industrial and gaming, which will outpace the PC industry growth for the foreseeable future. Our semi-custom APUs already have a number of confidential high-volume design wins in place. We plan for our embedded business to comprise approximately 20% of our quarterly revenue by the fourth quarter of 2013, up from 5% today.","And finally, as we noted earlier, we will continue to focus on driving down into the Ultraportable and ultra low-power form factors that continue to grow rapidly. APUs are ideally suited for these new products, from Ultrathins and tablets to a new breed of entry-level notebooks that will drive growth in the emerging markets.","So in summary, we are facing the challenges in the global IT market head on. We are resetting and restructuring our business to reduce our cost base from earlier this year by 25%. We are targeting a $1.3 billion revenue breakeven point by third quarter 2013. We are also delivering powerful new APUs in 2013. And finally, we are aggressively pursuing fast-growing adjacent markets where our IP provides differentiation and the opportunity for AMD to grow share. These include dense serving, new embedded markets and new lower-power form factors. Together, these actions will return AMD to profitable growth.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Interim CFO, Devinder, to discuss our financial results for the third quarter. Devinder is an experienced financial executive with more than 28 years of experience at AMD. He has served as the company's Corporate Controller since 2001. Devinder?","Devinder Kumar","Thank you, Rory. Revenue for the third quarter of 2012 was $1.27 billion, down 10% sequentially, driven by an 11% decline in the Computing Solutions segment and a 7% decline in the Graphics segment revenue. Gross margin was 31%, down 15% sequentially, partially due to the $100 billion inventory write-down which adversely impacted gross margin by 8 percentage points. This write-down was the result of lower-than-anticipated future demand for certain products and mainly comprised of the first-generation A-Series APUs codenamed Llano. Third quarter gross margin was also negatively impacted by weaker-than-expected demand in the quarter, and this contributed to lower ASPs for microprocessor products as well as lower utilization of our assembly and test manufacturing facilities.","Non-GAAP operating expenses were $516 million, 8% less than prior guidance, primarily due to tight spending controls and lower bonus and commission expenses. R&D was $328 million, 26% of net revenue. SG&A was $188 million, 15% of net revenue.","Non-GAAP net loss was $150 million, and non-GAAP operating loss was $124 million, both of which include the aforementioned $100 million inventory write-down.","Interest expense was $44 million, flat compared to the prior quarter. The tax provision for the quarter was 0 compared to a $6 million tax benefit in the prior quarter.","Non-GAAP loss per share, including the impact of the $100 million inventory write-down, was $0.20, calculated using 745 million basic shares.","Adjusted EBITDA was negative $35 million, down $208 million from the prior quarter due to an operating loss which resulted from lower revenue in the third quarter as well as the $100 million inventory write-down.","Computing Solutions segment revenue was $927 million, down 11% sequentially due to lower ASPs driven primarily by weaker-than-expected demand, as well as lower unit shipments.","Client Product revenue decline 11% sequentially due to lower unit shipments and ASPs in the third quarter, especially for desktop processors. We shipped a record number of Trinity-based products in the third quarter, and Trinity is a growing portion of our client product mix. In addition, we made substantial progress in the desktop channel, reducing Llano inventory in the third quarter.","Our server processor revenue declined from the prior quarter, mainly due to lower unit shipments and an ongoing mix change away from higher density servers. Chipset revenue declined sequentially, primarily due to lower unit shipments in the quarter.  Computing Solutions segment operating loss was $114 million, down $196 million sequentially, primarily due to lower revenue in the quarter and the previously mentioned $100 million inventory write-down. Graphic segment revenue was $342 million, down 7% compared to the prior quarter due to lower GPU unit shipments to OEMs, partially offset by higher general sales and royalties. Game console royalty revenue was up sequentially. Graphics segment operating income was $18 million, down $13 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to a decline in revenue.","Turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including long-term securities ended the quarter at $1.5 billion. Cash declined $279 million compared to the previous quarter, which was primarily the result of operational cash flows. Given the reduced size of our current business and OpEx reductions, we are adjusting our optimal cash balance from $1.5 billion to approximately $1.1 billion. Additional cash outflows that will occur in the fourth quarter of 2012 include a $50 million cash payment to GLOBALFOUNDRIES in the fourth quarter related to the 28-nanometer product limited waiver of exclusivity, as provided in the 2012 amendment to the Wafer Supply Agreement, with the final payment of $175 million related to the waiver to be paid by December 31, 2012.","Debt as of the end of the quarter was $2.04 billion. In the third quarter, AMD repaid in full all of the outstanding principal and accrued interest of the company's 5.75% convertible senior notes due 2012 or approximately $499 million and issued a $500 million aggregate principal amount, 7.5% senior notes due 2022.","Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter was $683 million, down $61 million compared to the end of the second quarter of 2012, due to lower revenue. Inventory was $744 million exiting the quarter, down $89 million, primarily as a result of the $100 million inventory write-down.","Now turning to the outlook. For the fourth quarter of 2012, AMD expects revenue to decrease 9% sequentially, plus or minus 4%. Operating expenses are expected to be approximately flat sequentially.","As Rory stated in his opening remarks, we are realigning our company with the business realities of today. We are reducing our workforce by approximately 15% in the fourth quarter and we will have a restructuring charge of approximately $80 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, primarily consisting of severance charges. Cash expenditures related to the fourth quarter restructuring will be paid almost entirely in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013.","We are taking additional actions to reduce our expense base and align our cost structure with lower anticipated revenue. Our skills and capabilities must be realigned with our market opportunities in order to position AMD to execute our strategic priorities while focusing on returning to profitability. We continue to evaluate our cost structure and anticipate restructuring actions in the first half of 2013, which will result in additional restructuring charges. However, we are currently unable to quantify these amounts.","Finally, as part of our financial reset, the company is targeting to break even at the operating income level at $1.3 billion quarterly revenue and quarterly operating expenses of approximately $450 million by the third quarter of 2013.","With that, I'll turn it back to Ruth. Ruth?","Ruth Cotter","Thank you, Devinder. Operator, we'd now like to open the call to questions and answers, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question in queue comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Hi, Rory. First, a question on the restructuring actions. What's the math or the thought process behind choosing the $1.3 billion revenue level to get to breakeven? It seems about 20% roughly above the fourth quarter guidance. It seems like you're baking in some pretty good news that's going to happen between now and then. Can you just talk about how that -- or that revenue level was chosen?","Rory P. Read","We basically looked at how the market was beginning to change and how we could refocus, Ross, in terms of where the growth opportunities would be across the next 12 months. We think by focusing to take down cost is the right approach here in the tactical time frame because it's clear the trends that are reshaping the PC industry are clearly occurring faster than everyone anticipated. We'll continue to look at that, Ross, as we go through next year and make assessments as we see the year unfold but we clearly wanted to set a breakeven point at a lower level than we've been running and to be able to consider those opportunities as we move forward in those new growth areas, which we're going to target where we see bigger growth.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess as the one follow-up, Devinder or Rory, whomever wants answer it. How should we think about the OpEx trajectory to get to that total savings number you gave next year? Especially considering you said you're going to have costs lowered in the fourth quarter, but you're guiding OpEx to be flat?","Rory P. Read","Yes. So Ross, what we've talked about is from earlier in the year, we've driven a set of programs and restructuring to reset the company at a 25% lower expense structure. We believe that will position us to move forward at this lower breakeven point.","Devinder Kumar","Yes, just to remind you, I mean as Rory said, the structure, if you go back and look at the OpEx in Q1 was right about the $600 million level. We have taken it down to about $500 million plus. To your specific question about Q3 and Q4 being planned, they have some offsets. In particular, in the engineering earlier related to some 28-nanometer product date bounds [ph] and other R&D expenses, there were some timing between Q3 and Q4 and in particular, given the holiday season that's coming on, we have some marketing campaigns for which we can go spend some money. So there were some offsets there. But if you read through the press release, we've said that the restructuring actions that we are taking will save about $20 million this quarter and then on a quarterly basis, that will be $40 million on a go-forward standpoint.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And that will start in 1Q from an absolute perspective quarter-over-quarter?","Devinder Kumar","Yes, that will start in 1Q on an absolute basis. And then as Rory said earlier, we are going to continue to drive the cost structure down to get to the $450 million OpEx structure by Q3 of 2013.","Operator","Our next question in queue comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.","Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Rory, you mentioned as part of your new strategy that you would be incorporating third-party cores and if you can just clarify the third-party cores, would that be for the server powered market or is it more broad?","Rory P. Read","We are clearly focused in terms of bringing those cores into the SeaMicro Freedom Fabric, the Supercompute fabric. I think that's very important in terms of building that basis in which to lower the cost of those cloud compute environments, Hans. Maybe Lisa, you want to add a little bit to that?","Lisa T. Su","Yes. Let me just add some color to that. I think we said from our strategy all along that we believe we want to build into the larger ecosystems in the industry. So we'll continue to build x86 products. But as we've announced before, we also have a partnership with ARM in the trust sale and security area and we'll continue to look at how we incorporate more third party IP over time to address some of these higher-growing markets.","Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then as a follow-on, the timings of these types of products hitting the market, is that say, end of 2013, 2014?","Lisa T. Su","It will probably be in the 2014 time frame.","Operator","Our next question here in queue comes from JoAnne Feeney from Longbow Research.","JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC","I was hoping perhaps you could help us understand how you accomplished two seemingly divergent goals. One being to accelerate the transition to these new adjacent faster-growing markets, while at the same time, cutting your expense bases. And given all the recent cuts there have been at the company, that's really brought things down to some very efficient levels, it would seem. It seems now, you're going to be stuck cutting sort of more of the creative talent. So I'm just wondering how you're thinking about doing both at the same time, 2 things that seem kind of contradictory?","Rory P. Read","I think what's important is to look at terms of how we're simplifying our product development cycles. And we've talked about this before in terms of creating the reusable IP blocks to create the structure in order to streamline our development and also to lower our cost of that development. We believe with the work of many talented engineers across AMD, their focus is to really streamline that activity, lower that cost and deliver our based set of offerings, and then to build off of that with our reusable IP base in order to go attack those markets. They're adjacent, JoAnne, they're not fundamentally different. These are APU graphics-oriented opportunities that allow us to take solutions like Kabini and like our APU base into those segments at a lower cost base and across the portfolio.","JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC","And then perhaps sort of related to that is you've talked about moving more into the embedded space and you say you have some design wins in place now that you're not at liberty to reveal. So you could you perhaps let us know what -- do you have a target for something like 20% of the business? What -- how far along are you to that 20%? How many design wins, what's the state design wins in place now that give you visibility to -- are you halfway there, 1\/3 of the way there? How many more design wins do you have to get in place? Because that tends to be a longer design win process, so I'm just wondering where you feel like you are there.","Rory P. Read","From the standpoint of the market, today, 85% of our core business is focused on the legacy PC market and that's obviously a slowing segment. And we believe those market trends that are affecting that are going to continue for the foreseeable future. This embedded opportunity is one we've been working on for some time. It's also around semi-custom. These opportunities are areas that are going to be significantly higher growth for this foreseeable future. Those confidential design wins are in place. We have silicon in play, already coming back to AMD, that gives us the basis to execute those plans. We believe that those -- that we're on pace to deliver those objectives in the second half of next year.","Operator","Next question here in queue comes from C.J. Muse with Barclays.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess first question, running through the numbers on your new breakeven at $1.3 billion and $450 million OpEx, it would appear that your target here, gross margin-wise is 35%, 36%. So I'm curious, are we seeing a permanent reset on the gross margin side or how should we think about that?","Devinder Kumar","Let me answer that. That's not true. We are not giving guidance either and that's not a statement on either profitability or gross margin. It is really putting in place an expense structure that allows us to break even at the operating income level at $1.3 billion by Q3 2013.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. But you told us $450 million in OpEx, so just doing math suggests 35%, 36%. So I guess is there something that we should be thinking about in terms of your agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES or what's driving that lower run rate?","Devinder Kumar","No. I think what you should take away from that is at the $1.3 billion revenue level, we will have an expense structure, the OpEx level of $450 million.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And if I could just quickly follow up on the gaming side, you talked about impressive wins there. Can you comment on what the margin profile should look like in that business relative to the overall business?","Devinder Kumar","No, we're not going to give that kind of guidance at this time.","Ruth Cotter","Next question in the queue comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","One on the embedded growth. So you've got embedded at about 5% today and in the ballpark of $1.3 billion in revenues. You think you'll be the 25% of revenues by Q4 of next year. And in Q3 of next year, you expect to be at same revenue level, about $1.3 billion. I guess that implies 2 things. One, it's a pretty big ramp of embedded over that time frame. Second, it seems like a permanent haircut to your outlook for your own PC graphics revenue. I was just wondering if you could comment a little bit on, I guess, the long-term outlook for your current business and the trajectory that you think you have on those embedded wins.","Rory P. Read","Sure, Stacy. We talked about 20% in the fourth quarter of 2013. There's no doubt that the PC market trends that are obviously occurring are happening much faster than people had anticipated. And I think it's our judgment to make sure that we put in place the structure a game plan, that breakeven point that reflects our understanding of the market as we see it today. That visibility is difficult at this point and we need to see how Windows 8 rolls out, how we enter into next year. The embedded -- that's in terms of this market step down but we do see the PC market as one that will continue to be under pressure for the foreseeable next several quarters. In terms of the embedded and semi-custom space, this is obviously a key area. It's an area that leverages the graphics and the APUs and allows us to move that technology, which we invested a huge amount of effort on with the talented engineers across AMD, into an adjacent space that has a better competitor profile for us. Lisa, did you want to add anything around the semi-custom or embedded segment?","Lisa T. Su","Yes, I think to the question of Stacy, how long does it take? They really are different segments, whether you're talking about consumer or you're talking about communications and industrial. So as Rory stated, we're targeting about 20% of our revenue in the second half of '13 and we'll continue to grow that business as we grow forward.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And I guess along those lines though, if you're going to get back to $1.3 billion by Q3, so Q4 is obviously pretty bad. Q1 would typically be seasonally down and Q2, usually not much better. That implies a pretty big healthy ramp seasonally into Q3 of next year to get there. But at the same time, if you're talking about your presence in PCs, your focus PCs declining and moving toward embedded, what is actually driving that big ramp into the back half of next year to get even back to your breakeven revenue?","Devinder Kumar","Let me take that question. I think you're taking away from the statement on the breakeven plan that we are targeting or guiding you towards the $1.3 billion revenue plan in Q3 2013, that's not true. We are giving guidance for Q4, right, as you heard Rory talk about the challenges in the PC market and some opportunities that we are pursuing but we are not at this time, giving any guidance on revenue either for Q1 or Q2 and definitely not for Q3 of 2013. What we're talking about is an expense structure whereby at the $1.3 billion revenue level, we have an OpEx structure in place at $450 million. One is an OpEx statement and the other one is about a revenue statement in terms of what you can do to math on the gross margin. I don't think the 2 are directly linked but if you go and make some assumptions about the gross margin, you can draw your own conclusions in terms of either what the revenue levels would be or what the profitability levels would be.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And one last quickly, if I could. In terms of your expense cuts in OpEx to get to $450 million, how much of that is coming from R&D versus SG&A? Are you holding more of your engineers in place and cutting sales and administrative or where are those cuts coming from?","Devinder Kumar","After the actions we take in Q4, we're obviously going to continue to assess the situation. But we're not going to give the granularity in terms of where the cuts are coming from. Overall, we're going to continue to assess. We're going to look at areas in particular. With the reduced labor base, there might be some opportunities to do some consolidations at certain sites or facilities that may trigger some savings but we're not going to go ahead and make granularity in terms of how much is R&D and SG&A.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just at a gross level, can you give us some feeling for at least, is more of it coming from one category versus the other, if you don't want to give any specific numbers?","Devinder Kumar","It's across all functions and globally.","Operator","Our next questioner is Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","As I've talked to your OEM and OEM customers throughout the year, it seems like there's a fair amount of enthusiasm for the products but it's also clear that the enthusiasm, there's some reluctance to build product lines around some of the products. I mean, Trinity brings some unique capability to the market but with the tough environment and maybe people who had Llano issues last year, they haven't been as fully committed as maybe, I'd like to see. When I talk to IT people at Opteron, there's a lot of excitement around the product but there's also issues of sort of is there enough OEM support. So there's not a clear line of when you're going to implement Opteron, sort of Opteron-based servers even though it's good for a lot of the workload. So my question is how does that gap get closed and is there a risk when you talk about restructuring and financial streams of cutbacks that, that situation of kind of getting that credibility gets tougher?","Lisa T. Su","Well, I'd like to talk a little bit about both segments. So if you look at the client or PC market, we have had actually very strong product success with Trinity, and we continue to believe that we'll see strong ramps as we go into the holiday season and into 2013. With Windows 8, we'll see over 125 systems that will come out with AMD-based processors. We do have to continue to build our execution credibility, and all of the focus is on executing both our current products as well as our 2013 products. So that is job 1 from the product side. On the Opteron side, similarly, we continue to build stronger relationships with the OEMs as well as the end customer base. So on the product side, I think there is a lot of focus on execution, and we continue to build that momentum with the customer set.","Rory P. Read","And Joe, we're interested to see the customer momentum around Win 8. As I mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks, we have over 125 platforms launching with Win 8 across tablet, Ultrathins and across all the traditional space. I think that's a good reflection of the interest and the dynamics we have in place.","Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then second question in terms of to follow up on Stacy's. I mean, the cuts that you're making, you don't want to be specific about where they're coming from, and I can understand that. Are there any kind of the major initiatives that you guys talked about at the analyst meeting and talked about through the year? Is everything there still a priority? Or are there any kind of activities-based things that you want to take out?","Rory P. Read","Yes, from the perspective of what we've done in terms of our business plan and road map and technologies, this company is an engineering-based company. There is no doubt about that. And our focus is to create those set of product that allow us to move forward. As I mentioned with Kabini, we already have all -- most of the silicon in-house for our launches for 2013, and we believe that's a strong portfolio and positions us well. We continue to identify and hire new talent to the corporation to build our engineering and our bench strength across the portfolio.","Operator","Next questioner is John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess, Rory, on the embedded target of going from 5% today to 20% by, I guess, the fourth quarter of next year, can you just help me understand a little bit about the visibility around that? Is that just mostly gaming, some of the rumored wins you guys already have? Or do you think by time you get to 20%, you're broad based among many end markets? Or is it concentrated? If you could help me there, that'd be helpful.","Rory P. Read","Yes, John. I think Lisa will kind of go into this in a little bit of detail. But the main point here is, this is a segment, it's an area that we can leverage our IP and the APU and the graphics prowess that we have. This is important because this segment will grow faster. It's also got a better competitive framework. And we have the design wins in place on pace to deliver that objective in 4Q. We've got to continue to execute and continue to build that market. But we're not done there. We need to continue to grow that segment as we move forward. Lisa, some additional thoughts?","Lisa T. Su","Yes, John. I think to your question of do we have good visibility into what needs to happen to ramp those design wins, I think the answer is yes. I think there's execution to be done on our side, but we have good visibility. Our goal is to broaden into more end markets. And some of the other markets take a little bit longer in terms of developing, but we are creating vertical industry teams to attack some of those other verticals as well.","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And then you guys did a good job kind of explaining the GLOBALFOUNDRIES payments through the balance of this year. As we think about next year, if I remember correctly, if nothing happens, the contract reverts back to Cost Plus. Or can you help me understand the GLOBALFOUNDRIES relationships beyond the calendar fourth quarter?","Rory P. Read","From a GLOBALFOUNDRIES perspective, John, we've seen an improving relationship and partnership with this key partner across 2012. And we've also seen an improving environment around their execution, and we appreciate that. As we've talked about previously, we're in ongoing discussions around the WSA, both for 2012 and 2013. Devinder?","Devinder Kumar","Yes. So I can add, I mean I've been involved, as you might know, with the WSA discussions for several years now, having worked on the deal from the inception when we formed GLOBALFOUNDRIES in 2009. And we continue to discuss with our partners. And many times, as you've seen over the last couple of years, we have worked through some difficult situations in the spirit of partnership but also what is mutually beneficial for both companies. The 2013 take or pay WSA as well as the 2012 WSA as well the 2013 WSA discussions are ongoing. We'll continue those discussions. They're not yet complete. But from my standpoint, they're going very well.","Operator","Our next questioner in queue comes from the line of Chris Danely with JPMorgan.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Are there any plans to sell the written-down inventory?","Devinder Kumar","When you go ahead and take inventory write-downs from an overall standpoint, accounting-wise, what happens is we have a product transition from Llano to Trinity. Trinity, as you heard Rory say, up 70% quarter-on-quarter, doing well. And with the market conditions, from an accounting standpoint, you also look at -- you value the inventory against the future demand and in particular, customer commitments. We did that in the early part of this quarter. Q3 ended, and we took the incremental inventory write-down. Typically in these situations, it's not our plan to go ahead and sell that inventory.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And then if you could just follow up on how you think gross margins can trend? And can you get back to the 45% mark you hit a few quarters ago?","Devinder Kumar","We're not giving guidance at that level. But I can tell you from a Q4 standpoint at least and especially given the market conditions, there are some factors that could be positive or negative, right? You have a weak macro environment; we are in a consumer-based holiday season quarter; and then, based on low-end competition from an overall standpoint. And obviously, those are negative factors. The Trinity product, being accretive to the margin, and especially being a higher mix of the product in Q4, is going to be helpful. And then the other thing is the Win 8 launch. But beyond that, given especially the uncertainty, we are focused on our break-even model. That's why I discussed earlier $1.3 billion or the $450 million OpEx number and not looking at it from a gross margin standpoint. I can add that just to explain that further, if you take the $1.3 billion and the $450 million, if revenue is higher, then obviously we could do better than breakeven. If gross margin is higher, we could do better than breakeven, or better than the 35% that was computed earlier. And then if both are higher, we could go ahead and be better than breakeven. But we are prepared, in particular with the trending that's occurring, to assess the situation, work specifically on the cost structure. And especially with the uncertainty that's out there, we want to stay nimble and be prepared to react as the case might be. This is not a guidance for Q3 2013 revenue. It is not a guidance for Q3 2013 gross margin. It is just an expense statement as to how we're going to drive the expenses from where we are today to the $450 million by Q3 of next year.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Well, so just to be clear, are you not telling us where your gross margins can go because you don't think they can get to 45%? Or you just don't want to tell us?","Devinder Kumar","I'm just not saying anything at this point.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. And then just for my last question, a quick clarification, I believe, on John's question on the embedded opportunity. Is it safe to say that by the end of next year, most of that revenue will be coming from the gaming industry? Or what about between the comm and the industrial side?","Rory P. Read","There's no doubt that this is a set of confidential wins, and we get can't get into any of those specifics. We're clearly targeting industrial, communications, gaming, so those areas where the APUs and our graphics IP make the most sense. But we can't announce them. We'll announce them in due course over the course of the coming quarters.","Operator","Our next questioner in queue comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","My question is in Q2, my understanding of the original miss in Q2 was driven in large part because you guys, you had supply issues, you -- you shorted the channel in favor of the OEMs and you've kind of lost -- you lost traction with the channel because of that. And I guess my question is, where do you think you are in the winning back the channel? What do you have to do to win it back? And where do you think you are in that process?","Rory P. Read","Sure, Mark. We saw the channel stabilize in the third quarter at the 2Q levels, and we also began to work down the inventory that we discussed in that period. We saw an improvement in sales out velocity. That means the rate of sell-through, through the channel. And we're going to continue to work on improving that sell-through rate and reducing that inventory in the coming quarters. As we mentioned last quarter, that was a multi-quarter effort to go forward. But the progress and the stabilization of the channel in 3Q was a good step forward.","Operator","Next questioner in queue comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Dean Grumlose - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","This is Dean Grumlose calling in for Kevin. It seems that when you look at the PC industry lately, there's a number of moving parts, a potential share erosion with tablets and smartphones, Windows 8 and the general macro decline. And have you talked to -- have you talked to your customers around the world? Could you please expand your views on how you may allocate share, if you will, or blame amongst these various factors to what makes up the current declining situation?","Rory P. Read","There's no doubt, Dean, that we're seeing 3 significant factors, as we mentioned in our earlier remarks, that are affecting the overall PC industry. And these trends are definitely occurring at a faster rate than the industry had anticipated. You're right to note that the macro environment is soft, and it's different across different geographies. And our weakness is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. We also saw OEMs in the market take a rather conservative approach to inventory in the lead-up to Windows 8. This will be an interesting fourth quarter in terms of how Windows 8 moves forward. We think it's an interesting and important event, but this is one we need to see play out. And clearly, tablets have taken an important point in the consumer's mindset both in the experience that a tablets creates, but also becoming an interesting device of choice at that lower end of the consumer client space. I think all 3 of these factors have accelerated this fundamental shift in the PC market, and we expect this shift and these pressures to continue for the next several quarters.","Dean Grumlose - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","When you look at the impact of smartphones and tablets, do you think this is temporary and can be reset by perhaps some more compelling portable solutions? Or do you think this is a permanent shift in demand, particularly in the mature, developed economies?","Rory P. Read","Similarly, that is clearly hard to predict out in time. I do believe the PC market is a market that will be here for the next decade. I don't think there's any question about that. But the dynamics of it and its growth rate are really fundamentally shifting right now. A lot of the historical forecasts and trend lines have broken over the past 2 quarters, and we need to see this reset stabilize and move forward. I think what's most important is to innovate, to continue to create solutions that match the customers' and the commercial market's needs. All-day battery life, touch, the right kinds of experiences with the graphical capabilities that we deliver are all important in this segment. I think that's key. And at the same time, while this is somewhat unpredictable, let's take our outstanding IP and engineering resources and focus those on areas we know will continue to grow and grow faster than the legacy PC market. That's core to our strategy moving forward, and we need to accelerate that strategy based on these shifting trends.","Operator","Next questioner in queue comes from the line of Cody Acree with Williams Financial.","Cody G. Acree - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","And Rory, thanks for the details. You've been very helpful. So maybe we can maybe ask for a couple more. So you've given this target of 40% to 50% of revenue from IP differential products. Can you maybe talk about a time line? I think Lisa said that some of the new products probably wouldn't really be impactful until 2014. Is that correct? And can you draw a path between here and there?","Rory P. Read","No, I think we've kind of laid out the basic concepts here across the call. Clearly in this tactical time frame, continue to build on the semi-custom embedded market. There's a good opportunity. It's where our IP and APUs play well. It's near adjacent segments. So it's easy to move there. And I like the competitive market there much better than the PC market, which is dominated by a single player in a big way. I think also as we move forward, there's opportunities in dense serving. That market will continue to evolve as low power and cloud serving becomes even more prevalent. This will be the fastest-growing segment going forward, and I think that SeaMicro acquisition and the work Lisa and her team are doing to build that out will occur over the next 1, 2, 3 years. And at the same time, how do we take our deep engineering capability into the new, low-power, ultra-portable emerging form factors in the traditional client space? This is an opportunity that is already presenting itself with our next-generation APU called Kabini, replacing our highly successful Brazos. And we'll follow that on with a series of other solutions. Lisa, would you like to add anything more?","Lisa T. Su","Yes, I think the best way to describe it is it's a portfolio that we're managing. So we've talked about semi-custom and embedded, having good visibility towards the end of 2013 and then as we get into some of the dense-serving spaces beyond that because it takes a little bit longer in those markets. But we're trying to build a portfolio to really enhance the growth prospects of our business.","Cody G. Acree - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","And Lisa, on the micro server side, it's pretty nascent for you and for everyone from an ecosystem standpoint. I guess what are the hurdles? What are the, I guess, some of the marks that you need to hit or that the industry needs to hit to get through there and make this more of a mainstream product?","Lisa T. Su","Well, we continue to work with our differentiated IP base. So the SeaMicro acquisition has been helpful in terms of our work with the large data center customers. And then we continue to need to build out the ecosystem to really build broad-based support. So I think it's a several-year journey, but it's certainly one that we're very committed to and continue to build out all of the aspects of the ecosystem.","Cody G. Acree - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","I guess -- but Lisa, more specifically on that ecosystem, are there certain elements that need to be knocked over first that could start to see adoption but knowing it's going to take several years to get it fully built out? But are there certain hurdles that may be met then in the near term?","Lisa T. Su","No. Certainly there are, and they come with both the hardware and the software ecosystem as well as the ODM ecosystem. So all of those are aspects that we are working on.","Cody G. Acree - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","And then lastly, on the pricing side, Intel was pretty adamant that they were actually seeing some stability in pricing, which doesn't really seem to make a lot of sense given the backdrop. Rory, I think you were pretty adamant that pricing has been competitive. What would you expect given what you're looking at the backdrop?","Rory P. Read","As we've talked about several times on the call, there -- the market dynamics that are occurring now are going to continue. Those macroeconomic factors, the Win 8 launch as well as the tablet phenomena, will continue to impact the PC market. I expect the market to be competitive, and I expect the market to continue to fall under pressure for the foreseeable future, the next several quarters.","Operator","Our next questioner in queue comes from the line of Chris Caso with Susquehanna.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just returning to some of the discussion about the break-even point. And I understand you're not providing revenue guidance going forward, but could you talk perhaps in principle? And given the uncertainty in revenue and some of the strategic changes that need to be made, what further actions can you take or perhaps are contemplating to protect cash flow and prevent from going into a money-losing situation if the transformation takes longer than what you expect?","Devinder Kumar","Yes, actually, we are very focused on the free cash flow breakeven and actually trying to get back to positive cash flow. The restructuring actions that were announced today in the call will help. The OpEx reduction on a go-forward standpoint will help. I also referenced early about the continuing discussions on the WSA relates to the 2012 take or pay and the 2013 WSA discussions that are ongoing. And that will obviously have an impact on the free cash flow on a go-forward standpoint. So we are laser focused on getting to free cash flow breakeven at lower revenue levels, but we're not giving guidance from the standpoint of the revenue on a go-forward basis except for the Q4 guidance that we have given.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And as a follow-up to that, I mean, is there anything you could say about cash flow over the next several quarters? I mean, should we expect cash flow to still come down as the cost cuts are being implemented? Or what's your view there?","Devinder Kumar","I think related to the restructuring actions with the savings that we will have on a quarterly basis and for the year end 2013, for sure, the cash flow -- cash needs will come down. And therefore, that will help the cash flow. On the guidance for 2013, we're not prepared to talk about it right now because of a lot of open items that we need to go through, in particular as I talked about the WSA discussions that are going on. So it's really too early to tell. Once we sort through those things and we look at where things fall, both from an expense standpoint and the WSA and the reduced cost structure, we can come back and give the guidance from a free cash flow standpoint and a go-forward standpoint.","Operator","Next questioner in queue comes from the line of Jim Covello.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. I was just hoping to go back to the -- a little bit of a follow-up from some of the other questions about pricing. I guess what kind of pricing environment are you assuming in the restructuring actions that you're taking? And then both for yourself -- in other words, how much leeway are you leaving yourself for your prices to come down and still hit these targets? And then what are you assuming in the way of pricing and aggression from Intel in that regard as well?","Rory P. Read","I believe, as we've talked about several times on the call, Jim, we believe it'll be a pricing market not unlike what we've seen over the past several quarters. What we're doing is basically restructuring our cost structure to position us for breakeven at a lower revenue level. We'll continue to assess that as we move through the next several quarters and make the appropriate adjustments.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I mean, I guess I heard you say that before on the call. But I guess maybe with some granularity, I mean, if you look at -- the pricing in the last couple of years has been abnormally high. And there's 2 ways to think about what's going on in the last couple of quarters. It's sort of the beginning of a resumption of a trend that would put us back on a trend line of lower pricing. Or that was the new normal, the better pricing, and what we're seeing these last couple of quarters is just sort of temporary. Which one of those do you think is the case as you begin to think about these restructuring actions?","Rory P. Read","Yes, as we've talked about earlier, I think what's clear is the market trends that are driving the PC market right now are -- have accelerated faster than we expected and clearly affected the trend lines and forecasting. Visibility is difficult right now. And I think, Jim, what we have to do is look at how each of the next several quarters unfold. There's clearly pressure in the market, and there will be competition.","Operator","Our next questioner in queue comes from the line of Patrick Wang with Evercore.","Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Two quick ones and then a longer one. The first to Rory, just a quick clarification. Can you help us understand which buckets are being defocused in your actions right now?","Rory P. Read","The key, Patrick, from a standpoint is what we're trying to do with the restructuring efforts is to reduce and simplify our development cycles and development processes across our portfolio as well as simplify our global structure. I mean, I think that's clear in terms of the focus we have in terms of reusable IP, how we're going to use the system, the heterogeneous systems architecture. All of those strategies that we talked about are reducing our complexity and shortening the development cycles, and we have to push for more efficiency on that. That's the basis of what we're trying to accomplish.","Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. So there aren't any particular product lines or anything that's ongoing that's getting killed or canceled?","Rory P. Read","No, we're not changing anything on that activity at this point.","Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just a second quick one. Devinder, just some clarification on the wafer supply agreement. Can you disclose kind of -- or walk us through what's left of your commitments for the fourth quarter? I think you guys had disclosed $700 million or so for the second half of the year.","Devinder Kumar","The way I planned that is for 2012, we had a take or pay agreement for a certain number of wafers. And what we disclosed is the total cost of that will be $1.5 billion. We had paid approximately $1 billion of that. So $0.5 billion remain. But the question is the time period at which we take those wafers, which is the basis of the discussions we continue to have with our partners. So I think you have to look at it in terms of the remaining 2012 take or pay, and there's $0.5 million -- $0.5 billion left, and what time frame is the -- are the wafers going to be taken and what time frame the cash is going to go out, if that's what you're asking. Then the second thing we are discussing, as we typically do on a yearly basis, is go ahead and discuss the 2013 WSA. And both of them taken together is what we plan to get to get to a conclusion to with our partners at GLOBALFOUNDRIES.","Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. And then just last question, I guess, Rory and Lisa. Can you talk about the competition in this newfound embedded space? And maybe perhaps what you feel your key advantages with the System-On-chip are?","Lisa T. Su","Yes, maybe let me take that. I think the key differentiation we have is really in the high-performance design methodology, the microprocessor technology as well as the graphics IP that we have. And we're really going after high-volume opportunities that can really use this IP in adjacent markets. So I think it's very unique capability that doesn't exist in many other places, and we really need to continue to build that model out over the next few years.","Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. Can you also quickly just mention a couple of the key competitors that are currently in that space today?","Lisa T. Su","I think you're familiar with many of our competition. I think our ability to be flexible and really put the semi-custom approach in place is something that's unique to our capability.","Operator","Next questioner in queue comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm  wondering how we should think about CapEx for next year. I think, Devinder, you did describe how you expect to break even on an operating basis. But how do you break even on a cash flow basis? What are your CapEx plans?","Devinder Kumar","I think it's really too early to get into 2013 at this point. I think most likely, if you come back in about a quarter in the call that we have for the Q4 result, we could probably give you some visibility into the early part of 2013 and then give you the guidance from that standpoint.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","All right. Maybe, Rory, one for you. What's going on, on the discrete graphics side? And maybe you have had a strong product with the Kepler architecture for a few quarters. Is that a segment you think would be de-emphasized going forward? Or is that still a priority business for you?","Rory P. Read","There's no -- as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, Vivek, that business performed in line with our expectations for the quarter, and the Graphics business remains a cornerstone for our technology portfolio across AMD. But I think Lisa probably is the best person to take that question.","Lisa T. Su","Yes, let me give you some color around the Graphics business. The Graphics business is actually a fairly stable portion of our portfolio. We continue to believe it's one of our key differentiators. In the third quarter, we had the macro effects that affected the PC industry that also affected Graphics, but we actually grew quarter-to-quarter in the discrete AIB channels. So I think we believe that our products are quite competitive, and we'll continue to invest in the graphics area to ensure that competitiveness.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","All right. And then one last one. Rory, in case things stay soft in the PC area next year, are there other -- is there a plan B? Are there other partnership or M&A arrangements that you can pursue or you can think about? Because I think that's really the focus of a lot of these questions on the call, because the PC market is slowing substantially and you have a very large competitor with very significant competitive advantages. So beyond just  breaking even, how do you position AMD and how do you reward shareholders going forward?","Rory P. Read","Vivek, I think it's around what we talk about. There's 2 steps that we need to take care. One, restructure and reset AMD, reduce our cost structure and improve our efficiency by lowering our break-even point on lower revenue. And as we've talked about several times in the call, we'll continue to assess that as the market unfolds. And then second, take our IP and our differentiation in Graphics and across our engineering portfolio, and take them to the high-growth segments. We talked about driving over the next several years 40% to 50% of our portfolio on those growth segments. We have planned this strategy. What we've seen now with the trends accelerating, that we need to move in a more aggressive path to tackle that now, both in the high-growth, ultra-low-power new clients, the dense server space and then, of course, in the embedded semi-custom space, all around the capabilities in IP that we have in AMD.","Operator","Next questioner in queue comes from the line of Steven with UBS.","Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I have a couple questions for Lisa. First question, I'm trying to understand this reusable IP strategy. When I think about what that means from a P&L point of view, I just think of it as a shift of OpEx into COGS because I just -- if you're going to cut staff, you're going to have compromises in terms of the IP blocks you can develop. And as a result, you're going to have some give-ups in die size, especially as you try to recover for some of the lost performance for those compromises that you're making. Can you help me understand if I'm thinking about that correctly or if I'm missing something?","Lisa T. Su","Yes, let me describe it this way. I think what we mean by reusable IPs is really getting to a much more System-On-Chip infrastructure so that we're able to spin products faster as well as customize them for their various markets. So I wouldn't see it as a shift from R&D to COGS, but more as building a foundation so that we can move quickly into new markets as they developed. And that's a very key thing for us. And we still will invest very heavily in our differentiating IP, such as the graphics IP that we talked about as well as our microprocessor IP. So that part doesn't change.","Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And as a second question here, just thinking more philosophically about your APU strategy. And you have differentiating graphics. Yet, when we look at the third-party market research data, you're not getting paid for it, at least when we look at what was done with Llano. I'm trying to understand if there's something we're missing in terms of maybe you are starting to get some of that uplift on Trinity and you'll get more with Kaveri. Or is there perhaps a basis for rethinking your strategy and focusing a set of higher-performance GPUs on smaller die sizes that could get your gross margin back to the mid to upper 40s where it's been your goal?","Lisa T. Su","Yes, I think the question around the APUs is a good one. Now we are very clear that the APU strategy is the right strategy for us. Now in terms of ensuring that we get the value for it, it's not just a piece of silicon, but it's also what we can do in the solutions environment. So we have been doing a lot of work to ensure that the applications can take advantage of all of the compute that we have on the silicon. And you can see that with some of the moves that we've made with the Heterogeneous Systems Architecture, creating industry consortium around the heterogeneous compute. And we've had a number of new members. We talked about QUALCOMM and Samsung joining as well as ARM and Imagination. So I think it's evolution over time. But it's clear that the APU strategy is the right strategy, and we need to get more of the applications taking advantage of the APUs over time.","Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","When do you -- just as a final follow-up, when do you think that will show up in the average selling price data?","Lisa T. Su","We continue to work on sort of the APU evolution over time.","Operator","And our final questioner for today comes from the line of Craig Berger with FBR.","Craig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just in looking at your core business, do you have any idea where end consumption is relative to what your fourth quarter guidance is? Is there channel inventory declines baked in? And where is kind of a bottom for this business as you're down 35% year-over-year?","Rory P. Read","Yes, Craig, from a standpoint -- as I commented earlier, on the channel business, we've seen that business stabilize in 2Q and 3Q at the levels that we saw there. That is also continuing to work off that inventory that I talked about in the previous earnings call. That was down -- a down channel from a sellout perspective, and we're going to continue to work that. I think we're making good progress there. In the overall PC market, there's no doubt that these trends have occurred. They've accelerated. And we believe they will affect the market for the next several quarters for the foreseeable future. We're taking clear and decisive action to restructure our business, lower our cost structure to enable us to hit breakeven at a lower revenue base, which we think is prudent given the market trend.","Craig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just as a follow-up on the gross margins, is it -- I guess we should be assuming that they continue to move lower from the normalized non-inventory write-down level that you printed in Q3. I mean, is there a reason for the decreased transparency?","Devinder Kumar","We're just not giving guidance for gross margin at this point. The market environment, as you observed and many have observed, is uncertain.","Ruth Cotter","Operator, thank you. That concludes the call.","Operator","Thank you.

And our 2018 fourth quarter quiet time will begin at the close of business on Friday, December 14.","Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions, and expectations; speak only as of the current date; and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.","We will refer primarily to non-GAAP financial measures during this call except for revenue, gross margin, and segment operational results, which are on a GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures referenced today are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in today's press release posted on our website. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our press release for more information. You will also find detailed discussions about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC and, in particular, AMD's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2018.","Now, with that, I will hand the call over to Lisa. Lisa?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. We executed well in the third quarter. We continued to build momentum for our new products as strong sales of our Ryzen and EPYC processors offset soft GPU channel sales, and drove our fifth consecutive quarter of year-on-year revenue growth, increased profitability and margin expansion.","Third quarter revenue was $1.65 billion, an increase of 4% from a year ago. Looking at our Computing and Graphics segment, third quarter CG segment revenue increased 12% year-on-year, driven by significant growth in both client processor and OEM GPU sales that offset a larger-than-expected decline in channel GPU sales.","Ryzen processor sales increased to more than 70% of our total client revenue in the quarter. We delivered our highest processor unit shipment in nearly four years, and believe we gained desktop and notebook client processor unit share in the quarter, driven by growth with both OEMs and in the channel. In desktop, we had strong demand for our higher end Ryzen 7, Ryzen 5 and Ryzen Threadripper processors, helping to drive a double-digit percentage year-over-year and sequential improvement in client processor ASP.","We expanded our desktop offerings in the quarter, bringing our Zen processor core and Vega Graphics to the entry level part of the market with the Athlon APU, and launching our flagship 32-core Threadripper 2 processor. With these new introductions, we now have a top to bottom lineup of client processors, based on our high-performance Zen architecture.","In notebooks, Ryzen mobile processor unit shipments doubled sequentially for the second straight quarter as OEMs ramped production of their latest AMD-based notebooks. 54 of the 60 Ryzen processor-based notebooks planned for 2008 [ph] have launched with the final notebooks expected to go on sale this quarter. Based on the success of first-generation Ryzen mobile notebooks, the expanded breadth of our customer engagements and our design win momentum, we are on track for an even larger assortment of AMD-powered notebooks in 2019.","In graphics, the year-over-year revenue decrease was primarily driven by significantly lower channel GPU sales, partially offset by improved OEM and datacenter GPU sales. Channel GPU sales came in lower than expected based on excess channel inventory levels, caused by the decline in blockchain-related demand that was so strong earlier in the year. OEM GPU sales in the third quarter increased by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year as new design wins began to ramp, including first shipments of our mobile Vega GPUs to support new premium notebooks launching this quarter.","In professional graphics, revenue increased by a double-digit percentage from a year ago driven by datacenter GPU sales, as we continued to gain traction in this important part of the market. We launched the Radeon Pro WX 8200 GPU for workstations in the quarter, delivering the world's best workstation graphics performance under $1,000 on real-time visualization, VR, and photorealistic editing workloads.","We remain on track to launch the industry's first 7-nanometer datacenter GPU this quarter. Customer interest in the product is strong based on its performance and differentiated feature set, and we have already secured multiple datacenter wins with shipments expected to begin in the fourth quarter. We continue to increase investments in GPU hardware and software to deliver industry-leading products that we believe will drive growth in the gaming, professional, and datacenter markets.","Turning to our Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom segment, third quarter revenue decreased 5% year-on-year, primarily based on semi-custom sales declining, as expected, as current generation consoles enter their sixth year. In server, we delivered our third straight quarter of strong double-digit percentage sequential revenue and unit shipment growth. We are seeing the largest demand for our top of the stack 24 and 32-core EPYC processors, which combine industry-leading core counts and I\/O to deliver performance advantages across cloud, virtualization, and HPC workloads.","We continue to accelerate engagements with our cloud service providers, highlighted by yesterday's announcement that Oracle launched new AMD-powered instances that offer significant TCO and performance advantages on general purpose cloud workloads in Oracle applications. We expect additional Tier 1 cloud service providers to announce availability of new EPYC processor deployments this quarter.","We secured multiple new customer wins on the HPC front, including Microsoft's announcement, they would offer an EPYC processor based supercomputing instance; and that Haas Racing has chosen Cray to build an EPYC-powered supercomputer to improve their computational fluid dynamics modeling for future cars.","Turning to enterprise adoption, we continue to build a strong pipeline and accelerate the ongoing ramps of EPYC-based offerings from the major OEMs, including Cisco, Dell and HP Enterprise. In the third quarter, we added dozens of new end customers across oil and gas, healthcare, aerospace, banking and other industries, based on the superior performance of EPYC processors in both data analytics and general purpose virtualized workloads.","We began sampling our next generation Rome server chip broadly across our customer base in the third quarter. And the feedback on this leadership product is very strong. As a result, cloud and OEM customers are engaging earlier, deeper, and more collaboratively with us on both Rome, and our long-term data center roadmap. We remain on track to exit the year with mid-single-digit server unit market share based on cloud customer adoption. And based on our strong competitive position and broad customer engagements, we believe we can achieve double-digit server unit share with Rome.","In closing, 2018 remains an inflection point for AMD, as we expect to exit the year with well over 50% of our revenue coming from new products, driving significant margin expansion. The foundational changes we have made across the business to strengthen our execution and the investments we have made to deliver a leadership Computing and Graphics roadmap are paying off.","Our current generations of high performance CPUs and GPUs are doing very well in market, putting us on track to increase profitability, grow revenue and expand margin for the second straight year. We see significant opportunities to build on this momentum as we transition to our next generations of high performance products and launch the industry's first 7-nanometer x86 CPUs and discrete GPUs over the coming quarters.","Demand for our high performance computing offerings remains strong, and our product portfolio and competitive positioning are getting stronger. We remain focused on executing our strategy and delivering our leadership product roadmap.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our third quarter financial performance. Devinder?","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, everyone. Q3 was a good quarter for AMD, as revenue, operating margin and earnings per share grew year-over-year. Gross margin was 40%, highlighted by the continuing ramp of our new Ryzen and EPYC products. We strengthened the balance sheet, reduced long-term debt by $97 million and further improved our gross leverage.","Quarterly revenue of $1.65 billion was up 4% year-over-year, driven by higher Computing and Graphics segment revenue, with higher client revenue more than offsetting lower graphics revenue. Third quarter revenue, including (sic) [included] (11:26) IP-related revenue, of which $86 million was related to our THATIC joint venture.","Gross margin was 40%, up 390 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by the ramp of new products, including Ryzen and EPYC processors. On a sequential basis, gross margin was up 280 basis points, primarily driven by IP-related revenue and the ramp of new products. Excluding IP-related revenue and memory and inventory-related adjustments, third quarter gross margin would have been 2 percentage points lower.","Operating expenses grew 12% year-over-year to $476 million, driven by R&D investments in our product roadmaps and incremental go-to-market investments. Operating income grew to $186 million from $148 million a year ago. Operating margin was 11%, and both business segments recorded double-digit operating margin percentage. Net income was $150 million compared to $100 million a year ago. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, using a diluted share count of 1.177 billion, was $0.13, compared to $0.09 per share a year ago.","Now, turning to the business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $938 million, up 12% year-over-year. Revenue growth was driven primarily by strong Ryzen product sales as we expanded our client compute offerings in the quarter. Ryzen products accounted for more than 70% of client revenue, up from approximately 60% last quarter, as we saw strength in both desktop and notebook offerings across OEM and channel partners. In graphics, channel GPU sales were down year-over-year, partially offset by strong Radeon, datacenter and OEM GPU demand.","For comparative purposes, third quarter 2017 blockchain-related GPU sales were approximately high-single digit percent of overall AMD revenue, while blockchain revenue in the third quarter of this year was negligible.","Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $100 million or 11% of segment revenue compared to operating income of $73 million a year ago. The increase was primarily driven by a richer client product mix and IP-related revenue, partially offset by lower graphics revenue.","Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $715 million, down 5% year-over-year. The year-over-year revenue decrease was driven primarily by lower semi-custom product and IP-related revenue, partially offset by higher server sales. For the third quarter in a row, EPYC processor units and revenue grew by strong double digits percentages quarter-over-quarter. EESC operating income was $86 million or 12% of segment revenue. This is up from operating income of $74 million a year ago, primarily due to a richer server and semi-custom product mix.","Turning to the balance sheet, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.06 billion at the end of the quarter, and we generated free cash flow of $62 million. Inventory was down sequentially from $750 million to $738 million. Total principal debt was $1.6 billion as we reduced our long-term debt by $97 million in the quarter. Term debt due in March 2019 is down to $66 million, and beyond that, there are no term debt maturities until 2022.","Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million compared to $184 million a year ago, and on a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted EBITDA was $709 million, resulting in gross debt leverage of 2.2 times.","Now, turning to our financial outlook, for the fourth quarter 2018, AMD expects revenue to be approximately $1.45 billion plus or minus $50 million. This would be an increase of approximately 8% year-over-year driven by sales growth of Ryzen, EPYC and datacenter GPU products. For comparative purposes, Q4 2017 revenue was $1.34 billion, adjusted for the ASC 606 revenue accounting standard, and included blockchain-related GPU sales of approximately low-double digit percent of overall AMD revenue. Sequentially, the midpoint of third quarter revenue outlook would be a decrease of approximately 12% driven primarily by lower semi-custom sales.","In addition, for Q4 2018, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 41%, up from 34% in the prior year, driven by the ramp of Ryzen, EPYC and datacenter GPU processors. Non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $465 million. Non-GAAP interest expense taxes and other to be approximately $30 million and free cash flow to be positive. For the full year 2018, we continue to expect annual revenue growth of mid-20s percent and to be free cash flow positive, and we now expect non-GAAP gross margin in excess of 38%.","In closing, the third quarter was a good quarter as we continued to ramp our new products. This momentum is driving improvement in our financial results against a backdrop of expanding customer demand as we prepare to ship and launch our first 7-nanometer GPU products before the end of the year. We are executing on our strategy and investment in financial priorities as we continue making excellent progress towards our long term target financial model.","With that, I'll turn it back to Laura for the question-and-answer session. Laura?","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you, Devinder. Operator, we're ready for our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Our first question today is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Your line is now live.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First question, if I may, Lisa, as you look into the fourth quarter and maybe discuss also the third quarter, can you just review the important puts and takes on the revenues, on the microprocessor and GPU side separately? And I know you don't like to discuss the competition, but I think there's some unique things going on in the competitive environment. I think there's a view that Intel's capacity constrained and with Nvidia's new product launches, how is that impacting how we should be thinking about the revenues? Thank you.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes. Hi, Mark. Thanks for the question. So, let me take those in order here. So, if we just look at the third quarter revenue, I would say that we did see a shift in our revenue mix as we went through the third quarter. Looking at the individual product lines, we had expected that the client business would be strong as we were ramping quite a few new notebook OEM systems as well as we had strong desktop product portfolio. And we saw the client business was strong. It was actually probably a bit stronger than we expected. The server business also performed quite well.","In the graphics business, we had our OEM and datacenter compute business performing well, but we did see the softness in the channel that was larger than we expected, and that was due to some of the channel inventory comments that I made earlier.","Now, as you shift into the fourth quarter, I think what we see is that our fourth quarter revenue mix really mixes towards the new products. And so, what you see in the product lines are, you'd see that client business continue to grow. And client is usually seasonally down into the fourth quarter, so we're doing better than seasonality with the client business. We expect the server business to grow as well as we get more traction with our EPYC products, especially in the cloud.","And then, we would expect, with our graphics business, that that will also grow sequentially, primarily on the strength of new products around our datacenter GPUs. And the semi-custom business actually will decline sequentially. The semi-custom business always declines in the fourth quarter. I would say this fourth quarter is a bit more pronounced; it gets a bit more pronounced as we get later in the cycle, as well as the fact that the ASC 606 accounting regulations tended to pull some of the revenue earlier in the year. But hopefully, that gives you a view of sort of the puts and takes around revenue.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","That's very helpful. And a follow-up, if I may, I think I heard Devinder say that you're expecting to ship EPYC 2 before the end of this year. And if I think back to a dozen years ago, when you had the second generation of server product, that kind of signaled an opportunity an inflection in the revenues. How should we think about EPYC 2 as we go into early next year? And what does EPYC 2 bring to your customers that EPYC did not? Thank you.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah. So, Mark, maybe just a correction. I think Devinder's comment was that our 7-nanometer GPU would ship here in the fourth quarter. We're on track to launch that here shortly. The second generation of EPYC, our 7-nanometer CPU, will ship in 2019. We are broadly sampling it now. I think from what we see, the performance is very competitive. And also many of our customers have had a chance to really spend time with the first generation of EPYC, get to learn our architecture and do much of the platform bring-up.","So, we're excited about what the second generation of EPYC can do for us. We're going to talk a little bit more about that in a couple weeks at our datacenter event, but we believe that our competitive position gets stronger as we get into 2019.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Thanks for the clarification.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Hans Mosesmann from Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is now live.","Hans Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Hey, Lisa, can you give us the puts and takes \u2013 or Devinder or both \u2013 on the gross margin dynamic in Q3? And also in Q4, is there an IP component in Q4? And I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Sure. Maybe let me start, and then Devinder can add. So, on the gross margin for the third quarter, I think we were up 4% year-on-year. We did have an IP component in this year as we had an IP component in the third quarter of last year. The majority of the improvement though was due to the positive product mix, sort of the client and server business really growing year-on-year, and with that, improving the product mix.","As we go into the fourth quarter, there is no IP-related revenue that's planned right now. So, with the guide at 41% margin, we really are at the, let's call it, the low end of our long-term guidance. And, again, that's on the strength of the product mix. It's a very positive product mix for us. The processor business, as we've always said, the new products are accretive to margin. And so, the client business is expected to grow. The server business is expected to grow. The datacenter GPUs are expected to grow. And then, there is a portion of that, that is the semi-custom business declining sequentially. But I would say that's a smaller portion. It's really the positive product mix that's going into the Q4 guide.","Maybe, Devinder, is there anything you wanted to add?","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","No. I think you covered it, Lisa. Thank you.","Hans Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.","Great. And then, the follow-up \u2013 if you don't mind a follow-up, as we look into early 2019, what can we expect in terms of seasonality for the semi-custom part of the business and on the PC side, just because there's some constraints out there from Intel and so on? Thanks.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah, so, look, if you \u2013 Hans, our typical seasonality is the second half of the year is stronger than the first half of the year. As we go into 2019, you would expect that the semi-custom business will be down relative to this year. And then, you would expect that we're still going to need a bit of time to work through some of this graphics channel inventory that we have. But on the positive side, we do see strength in our processor business in both the client and the server side.","As it relates to the current supply environment, we did see some pockets of constraints in the supply chain around PCs. We saw that towards the end of the third quarter. We are increasing our production such that we can satisfy some of that demand. And I think that's a short-term statement. But I think on a mid-term statement, it's an environment where we're partnering very closely with our OEMs to make sure their requirements are met.","Hans Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thanks, Hans.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matt Ramsay from Cowen & Company. Your line is now live.","Matthew D. Ramsay - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good afternoon. Lisa, I wanted to follow up a little bit on the last, I guess, couple of sentences in your prior answer there. There is a lot of things moving in the model near term, but as we think about how you're positioning the company in the client business over the next, I don't know, 24 months or so, with some supply constraints at Intel and some changes in their marketing support for OEMs for some of those programs and their spending. How do you think about how you're positioned with the key top five or six OEMs in terms of both PC and, I guess, desktop and notebook over the next 24 months? And sort of what are the puts and takes of how much you're really willing to lean into that business in order to gain unit share? Thank you.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes, Matt, thanks for the question. So, on the PC business, particularly around client processors, I am bullish on that business. It's a good business for us. Our products are very well positioned, when you look at both the desktop and notebook segments. It was important for us to get these new platforms out into the market, and so we have 54 new notebook platforms out in the market with a few more to go, as we finish up here the fourth quarter. I think the traction that we see in terms of unit shipments, the metric around Ryzen being 70% of our client business, over 70%, and we expect that to continue to accelerate. So, we're bullish on the client business as a good business for us to grow over the next 12 to 24 months.","Matthew D. Ramsay - Cowen & Co. LLC","Got it. That's helpful. And just as a follow-up, I understand in a couple weeks you'll probably be talking a bit more about the datacenter GPU portfolio. But I guess there has been a lot of movement in software ecosystem as you've been working, and the team has to develop the MI-Open product in terms of software. Maybe you could give us a little bit of an update on how you feel that's positioned for Caffe and Tensor, which I guess are the two key development environments for AI, and what do you think the long-term prospects for that business are over the next couple of years. Thank you.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes. So, on the datacenter GPU business, this will continue to be an area of investment for us. I think we've made very nice progress this year. I think as we finish up the year, we expect it to again make good progress. We have invested in both the hardware and the software side, so I think the 7-nanometer GPU starting shipments here in the fourth quarter is important for us. And on the software side, yes, we will also be updating the status of our software environment.","I think the nice thing is, as we said, the datacenter is just an enormous opportunity whether you're talking about CPUs or GPUs, and we're engaging deeply with cloud customers, who are spending the time and the resources to optimize to our architecture. So, again, I think a datacenter tends to take longer from design win to revenue, but we're starting to see some nice signals there.","Matthew D. Ramsay - Cowen & Co. LLC","All right. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live.","Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I had two of them really quick. The first is actually on the CPU side, the server side. So, is there any reason why a 10-nanometer chip wouldn't be able to outperform your 7-nanometer product, given that you've already been able to do some of the testing on the server side?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Maybe I would answer the question this way. When we look at our 7-nanometer product and its positioning in 2019 across the server landscape, we feel very good about the positioning. I think it's not just 7-nanometer, 7-nanometer is important, but we've also made some significant changes to the architecture as well as how \u2013 sort of the system. So, I think, overall, we feel with the design and process capabilities, that our 7-nanometer products will be quite competitive.","Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And then, secondly, in terms of production, I know you guys kind of gave out the mid-singles and double-digit market share opportunity in the server side. So, is that due to capacity constraints at TSMC or is that due to your own estimates of what type of share you think you can get?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Well, we have a great relationship with TSMC. I think they're very supportive of our roadmap in 7-nanometer. So, it's not due to any supply constraints. It's just due to the time that we believe it will take for vendors to really qualify new systems.","Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And just one last really small one for me, the graphics business, the highest blockchain or cryptocurrency quarter was Q1 of 2018, is that correct?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","The highest \u2013 it was between Q4 and Q1. They were pretty close.","Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrell Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking my question. For the first one, Lisa, can you help us kind of quantify how much of a headwind was that excess graphics inventory in Q3 and maybe also in Q4, so we can reconcile some of the differences between what you're reporting and guiding versus some of the consensus expectations out there?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah. Sure, Vivek. So, the best thing I can say is when we look at the CG segment as a segment, we're down about $150 million here in the third quarter. We had expected the segment to be down, but we probably expected it to be down about $50 million or so. And if you look at that difference from when we started the quarter, that's entirely the GPU channel. We had some other puts and takes in there, but it's basically the GPU channel.","As we go into the fourth quarter, we do expect graphics to be up, and that's primarily on the strength of the datacenter GPU business. And we're modeling the channel, let's call it, roughly flattish. It's seasonally about flattish, but given some of the inventory in the channel, that's how we're modeling. Does that help you?","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. So, basically, you're saying this problem kind of goes away in Q4 or you're done with it by now? Or can it continue to be a headwind in Q4?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","We are expecting that it might take a couple quarters to completely get back to, let's call it, a normal channel. However, it is factored into our Q4 guidance.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. And then the second one, Lisa, is on the server business. You outlined the target to get to mid-single digit exiting this year. Is the next 5% share easier or tougher to get? How do you think your competitor will respond? And how important is it to ramp your 7-nanometer product next year to get towards that \u2013 to make that jump from the 5% to the next target of 10% share?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah, so the way I look at it, Vivek, is it's really a continuum, and the continuum is we have a number of customers that are very actively working with EPYC. I think the first 5% does include some cloud customers ramping, and that's important. And then, as we go beyond that, we would expect that they're more used to our architecture. Our architecture is socket compatible between the first and second generation. We're sampling it now. And so, I think the idea is we would like to see some acceleration in that, as we bring in the 7-nanometer product, but we'll certainly have to go through that process.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is now live.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Bernstein Research","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I wanted to ask about graphics trajectory in the next year. I mean, given my math \u2013 I know you talked about maybe $100 million light versus your expectations, but my math suggests it might have fallen as much as $250 million sequentially, if you're going to get it at least to the level that it was last year. And if I look at what that trajectory means going forward, if I asked you whether or not you thought graphics revenues could be down 20% year-over-year in 2019, like how would you feel about that? What's your response to that?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah. Stacy, let me make sure I clarify the first comment, and then I'll certainly answer your comment. My comment was at the segment level. So, at the segment level, I said we were about $100 million light. And I also said that client performed a little bit better than expected. So, I think you can say that it was probably \u2013 if you \u2013 that should help quantify sort of Q3. When I look at it going forward, I would not expect that type of decline on a year-on-year basis. I think what you'll see is some funky seasonality, right? So, the first half of the year was very strong for graphics. I think the first half of 2019 will not be very strong for graphics.","But we have a number of product launches coming up, and we're pretty excited about some of those product launches. And so, I would view that \u2013 we need to work off some of this channel inventory that's in place, and then go back to sort of a more typical seasonality, which would see the second half stronger than the first. Does that help?","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Bernstein Research","Okay. That does help. Thank you. For my follow-up, I want to ask about the datacenter GPU. So, you've been talking a lot about that. You've actually been calling it out as driving, like, some of the growth in the current quarter and going forward. How big is that today? I mean, you're calling it out, but can you give us an order of magnitude? I mean, is it more than $20 million in the quarter at this point? Where do you see that going into Q4? Like, what are your expectations, as you ramp the 7-nanometer product into next year?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","You always have a way of asking the most granular questions. I would say...","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Bernstein Research","I don't think it's that granular.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","It is more than $20 million. We do see it as a driver. We do see it as more of a driver as we go into 7-nanometer. And this is one of those cases where typically the datacenter products ramp slowly, but as you know, the deployments can sometimes be lumpy. And there's good traction on some early design wins. And so, we expect it to be a meaningful contribution in Q4.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Bernstein Research","Got it. And just, one more really quickly, how do you feel about your $0.75 in 2020? Are you still holding to that?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","There are no changes to our long-term financial model at this point.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah, not today.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Bernstein Research","Not today. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I just want to go back to the IP side of things. You gave some color about the fact that it's not contributing anything in the fourth quarter, and that's helpful on the gross margin side. But one other detail, Devinder or Lisa, is I think the $86 million you talked about, you said that was a portion of the IP, and then you had some other inventory related changes. Can you just give us a little bit more color on the size of those different buckets? How big was IP overall? Anything there would be helpful.","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah, on the IP, I think as we talked about, there's $86 million that's associated with our THATIC joint venture. There was some other IP, call it, about approximately about $35 million in the quarter, and that is why we talk about it in two parts.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you. And then as my follow-up, as I'm looking at the GPU side of things, not to kind of beat the dead horse there too much more, but the ASP side of that equation or pricing side, is the channel inventory clearing dynamic something that also manifests itself on pricing pressure? Or is it just a matter of time to absorb that inventory which, Lisa, I think you said was going to be a flat dynamic in the fourth quarter, but it sounded like it was going to be returning to a headwind in the first half of next year?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah, no, if that's how it sounded, that's not what I meant. So, I would say that the GPU \u2013 let's call it, the weakness in the GPU channel or primarily in the sell-in, is, let's call it, for \u2013 we might see that for the next quarter or two. But as you look through the overall business, I think gamers are still buying GPUs, and so this is really a matter of just absorbing some of the first half let's call it oversupply as it relates to GPUs. And that's translating into a bit weaker sell-in. But we are still tracking the sell-out and the sell-through through the \u2013 to the end customers.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And if I could sneak in one quick one, just OpEx intensity. I know you're not going to guide for OpEx for 2019. But the 26% to 29%, how do we think about where you are in the investment stage where whether it's the EPYC or the other new products \u2013 EPYC 2, I should say or the other new products, where you kind of get over the hump and you don't need to invest as much? Is that a framework we should think about? Or do you believe the opportunities are big enough and the competitors are spending enough that, that OpEx intensity in that range is likely to persist?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Well, I think, Ross, if you look on an annual basis for 2008 (sic) [2018] (40:48), we'll be approximately 28% of OpEx to revenue. And I think what we said in the past is we will grow OpEx, but we will grow it slower than revenue growth on an annual basis. And that's still our philosophy.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.","Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. If you said this, I may have missed it. But can you talk about how much servers grew sequentially in Q3? I guess you were fairly specific on that point in Q2. I think you said double digits this quarter. Do you expect to be sort of \u2013 as you talk about mid-single digit next quarter, are you kind of halfway to that target this quarter? Just help us calibrate where server is.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah, I think, Joe, it would be fair to say that with strong double digits this quarter, and we'd just say we're about halfway, I think that's reasonable, plus or minus.","Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And then with regards to the 7-nanometer, I know you're going to talk more about this as at the product launch. But can you talk about what 7-nanometer itself gives you? Do you expect there to be a higher sort of clock speed on the microprocessors and the GPUs? Is it a better transistor budget? Is it a better cost per transistor? Obviously, there's a lot of writing on you guys being early in both segments on 7-nanometer. Can you just talk about the benefits of that?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes, and we will go through this in a lot more detail on November 6. But at a high level, I think 7-nanometer gives us better density. So, for a given system, we can put more cores on it. It gives us better power, so that gives us total cost of ownership. And it does give us better performance as well.","Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Lisa, congratulations on the strong gross margin results. I just wanted some clarification. The calendar fourth quarter guidance, does that include IP revenue in the gross margin? And clearly, gross margin's being helped in December by the growth in new products, but it's probably also being helped by the sharp falloff in semi-custom. Should we think about kind of the gross margin level in December as being the new floor off of which you can continue to grow sequentially, even as semi-custom comes back seasonally? Or how do I think about that? And I have a follow-up.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes. So, on the gross margin, [Technical Difficulty] (43:25) Q4 guidance, there is no assumed IP-related revenue. So, that's all product. We do have, as I said earlier, a very positive product mix within the processor side of the business, so the client, the server, as well as the data center GPUs. We are helped somewhat by the fact that semi-custom is down. But I would say the much larger piece of that is the product related growth in new products.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Is this the new floor, Lisa, or is it too hard to tell?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","I don't know if I would say it's the new floor. I would say that we're very pleased that we're at the lower end of our long-term guidance. And certainly, we'll see what the puts and takes are as we go from a quarterly standpoint into 2019. But on a full year basis, in 2018, I think Devinder mentioned this in his prepared remarks, we're now over 38%. We've really grown margins every quarter over the last number of quarters and we're happy with that. I think that's the strength of the model. We've always said that the strength of the model is improving the product mix and I think that's what we see here today.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And then, Lisa, I apologize, if I missed it, but just relative to your Q4 guidance, given some of the capacity issues that your competitor's having, is there any share gain \u2013 incremental share gain assumptions based upon shortages of CPUs? Is that something that should be a tailwind in Q4? Or does that take longer and might be something we don't see until the calendar first quarter? Any commentary around that would be helpful.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah, we do see pockets of shortages. We are ramping up production. I do believe we see some incremental benefit here in the fourth quarter. But I don't want to take away from the fact that we have a strong portfolio, and we have a lot of platforms ramping. So, the client business was always going to be up for us in Q4 and, are we benefiting a bit from let's call it some of the pockets of shortages? Perhaps.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next today is coming from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.","Aaron Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. Thank you for taking the questions. I have two, as well, if I can. I wanted to go into the semi-custom segment. And we've talked about kind of an elongated or near the end of the life in some of these gaming platforms. I was just kind of curious as to how you guys think about that piece of the business as we start to look into 2019? And is there a point in time where we can start to think about product cycles as driving reacceleration of growth in that segment?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes. Sure. So again, without commenting on any specific design wins, what I would say is, in 2019, we will be in the seventh year of the game console cycle, and so we do expect it to be down. And if you look at the cycles, you'll see that it's very consistent with previous cycles. When we look forward, when I look at what happens beyond 2019, I like our semi-custom business. I think it's a good business for us. I think it continues to be a place where we differentiate ourselves because of our ability to customize for various customers. And I do see it growing again beyond 2019, and it will continue to be an important part of our business.","Aaron Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then on the channel inventory dynamic, there's a lot of kind of moving parts right now in the market, and we've seen obviously with the U.S.-China tariff situation, there's been some questions around demand pull-forward or any kind of elements around the tariff situation that's impacted demand. I'm just curious, have you seen anything from your customers that has suggested that there's been any kind of demand pull-forward and any effects on your business as it relates to U.S.-China, especially as we start to look into next year and the potential for increased tariffs further?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes, so, we're monitoring the tariff situation very closely. There's a lot of activity around that. I would say from what we see today, we don't see anything material as it relates to the tariffs, whether it's pull-ins or just the overall impact of tariffs. But we are doing quite a bit to adjust our supply chain, as I'm sure many others are. We already had a supply chain that was highly multi-sourced, and so that's very helpful. And we're adjusting our supply chain to ensure that we have further options such that the tariffs are not a significant impact on our business.","Aaron Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. On the weakness in the channel-based GPUs, I'm just wondering if some of the weakness is due to the gaming bans in China? It looks like China is hindering the introduction of new games, but not sure if it's impacting actual GPU sales, and sort of the enthusiast gamer's motivation to kind of move up the stack?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","I don't think we see that specifically, Harlan. I think what we're seeing is more just we had very strong demand in the first half of this year. And as the supply chain filled up, we're just seeing some excess inventory that needs to be worked through right now. We're not seeing anything specific relative to that China issue you mentioned.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for the insights there. And then, on the wafer supply agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES, now that they're not going to be supporting 7-nanometer, you'll be moving I think most of your 7-nanometer client products to TSMC. And as of right now, I think you guys still need to pay them a fee for every 7-nanometer product you produce at TSMC. Can you just give us an update on the new wafer supply agreement that doesn't include 7-nanometers? Obviously, this should be beneficial for your gross margins.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes. So, look, GLOBALFOUNDRIES is a good partner. They continue to be a very important partner for us. We are in discussions with them about how to update our agreement post their strategy updates, and we're making good progress on that. So, we'll give you more detail as we get closer, but overall, GLOBALFOUNDRIES continues to be an important partner for us.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, absolutely. Thanks, Lisa.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thanks, Harlan.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Operator, we have time for two more questions, please.","Operator","Certainly. Our next question is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your line is now live.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just a question and a follow-up on THATIC, the $86 million. My understanding is you had an original agreement. You were getting an OpEx offset, and then eventually if there was product revenue, you'd recognize that revenue with your portion of your ownership on those wafers. So, I'm just kind of curious, what's this $86 million? Is it additional IP? And any color as to what it's for, if possible?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah, Blayne, it is related to some additional IP with THATIC. And we've completed some technology milestones in this past quarter. And so that's what that was.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got you. And then I wanted to ask you \u2013 it's been well-known that there is graphics inventory. You mentioned that graphics pricing was down. Just kind of curious your expectation for that discounting as we get into the end of the year here. What have you seen? And what are your expecting as you look into December?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah, we're not expecting any significant changes from an ASP standpoint, if that's what you're asking. I think what we see is the inventory just has to be worked through, and it's working through the system.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you for taking the question. I did join a little bit late, so I do apologize, if you addressed this. Lisa, I just had a question on the client CPU business and how you think about market share versus profitability going forward. Given some of the shortages near term, I'm sure you have the opportunity to pick up share, if you wanted to but perhaps at a lower gross margin. So how do you think about the client business over the next year or two? How do you balance market share versus profitability? Thank you.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Sure. So, the Client business is a good business for us from a margin standpoint. And as we look forward, we look at it as an end-to-end portfolio. So, we really do have an end-to-end portfolio across notebook and desktop, and our goal is to continue to improve the profitability of that business.","As it relates to unit share, I think unit share is certainly important. We look at revenue growth overall as important for that business, but I believe we'll be able to do that at good margins and to continue on our margin path.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you very much for joining our conference call today, everyone.

Lisa?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you, Laura. And good afternoon to all those listening in today. We started 2018 with excellent financial results, as we delivered our third straight quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth. First quarter revenue of $1. 65 billion grew 40% year-over-year. Gross margin improved 4 percentage points and earnings per share increased significantly based on very strong operating and net income growth.","Our strong first quarter financial results demonstrate that our long-term strategies paying off. We are executing consistently on our product roadmap. Our customers are increasingly adopting our new products and we are strengthening the foundation of AMD with the right long-term investments.","Looking at our Computing and Graphics segment in the quarter, excellent momentum for our premium product portfolio drove double-digit year-over-year and sequential revenue growth. Client processor sales were significantly better than seasonality, as Ryzen processor shipments grew year-over-year and sequentially. Ryzen processors accounted for 60% of our overall client processor revenue, up from the low-40s in Q4, with desktop and notebook client processor ASPs increasing.","Product execution was strong in the quarter, as we expanded our Ryzen processor portfolio with new high-performance products. We launched the first AMD Ryzen desktop APUs, combining the power of our Zen CPU and Vega GPU on a single chip, delivering the world's most powerful graphics on a desktop processor, with the Ryzen desktop 2400G.","Initial sales were strong in the component channel, which contributed to the significant Ryzen processor sales increase in the quarter. Additionally, we began shipments of our second-generation Ryzen desktop CPUs based on a 12-nanometer Zen+ architecture, delivering outstanding gaming performance and best-in-class multiprocessing leadership for gamers, creators and hardware enthusiasts.","Ryzen mobile unit shipments also ramped in the quarter ahead of OEM system launches planned for Q2, driving double-digit increases in our mobile processor unit shipments, both year-over-year and sequentially.","Initial Acer, HP and Lenovo platforms had strong sales in the quarter, and Dell released new notebooks and 2-in-1s in early April that further expanded our Ryzen portfolio. Additionally, our first Ryzen PRO commercial notebooks are expected to launch in Q2. Dell, HP and Lenovo are all planning to offer AMD-based commercial notebooks based on the excellent performance and features of this new APU.","Overall, the number of Ryzen-based systems from OEMs continues to grow. In Q2 alone, we expect 25 new Ryzen-based consumer and commercial notebooks to launch, and our customers remain on track to bring a total of 60 Ryzen-based systems to market by the end of the year.","In Graphics, we delivered strong year-over-year revenue growth as ASP and unit shipments increased significantly. On a sequential basis, revenue increased and we outperformed seasonality with strong Radeon Vega and 500 series channel sales, driven by both gaming and blockchain demand.","Gaming continues to be a top priority for us, with growth being driven by the expanding number of PC gamers and increasing demand for graphics performance to deliver more immersive experiences. Demand for our Radeon series of graphics products remained strong as new AAA game titles, such as Far Cry 5, were released. We continued our investments in gaming software and released our Radeon esports experience, providing a performance uplift on popular esports games such as Fortnite, PUBG, DOTA 2 and Overwatch.","We continue to see significant demand for Radeon Vega graphics family, as customers accelerate their ramps based on increasing availability of our high-performance GPUs, with more supply coming to market.","In Professional Graphics, HP and Dell both expanded their AMD Radeon Pro workstation portfolio offerings in the quarter, including HP's launch of new ZBook thin and light mobile workstations powered by the AMD Radeon Pro WX 3100.","Our machine learning strategy continues to gain momentum. Mega data center partners are validating and testing our Radeon Instinct MI25 for deep learning applications, and we introduced our Radeon Open Compute ecosystem, ROCm 1.7, a top to bottom open solution software stack for machine learning.","I'm also happy to report that our next-generation 7-nanometer Radeon Instinct product, optimized for machine learning workloads, is running in our labs and we remain on track to provide samples to customers later this year.","Turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Q1 revenue decreased year-over-year, due to lower semi-custom revenue, as expected, based on maturity of the current game console cycle, and increased sequentially. In the quarter, Microsoft announced support for our industry-leading Radeon FreeSync technology in their Xbox One S and Xbox One X consoles, delivering stutter-free gaming experiences.","Server revenue increased double-digit percentage sequentially, across mega data center, OEM and channel customers. EPYC processor unit shipments nearly doubled from the previous quarter. We continued to grow our data center momentum with dozens of new design wins across key workloads, including HPC, storage, virtualization and cloud applications.","Dell EMC launched three of their newest PowerEdge platforms, powering virtualized storage area networks, hybrid cloud applications, dense virtualization and big data analytics with EPYC 7000 series processors. Recently, supercomputing leader, Cray, announced that it added EPYC processors to its Cray CS500 line of HPC offerings. The Cray announcement tops off a very active quarter in HPC and big data, building on workload momentum in automotive simulations, university clusters and healthcare.","And multiple mega data center customers pass key production milestones as they look to expand their deployments of EPYC-powered instances this year. To-date, there are more than 40 EPYC-based platforms in market, and we are actively working with OEMs, system integrators and channel partners to increase deployment to end customers. We remain focused on achieving mid-single-digit server unit share by the end of 2018.","Our Embedded business delivered increased revenue, unit shipments and ASPs, year-over-year and sequentially, as we introduced two new product families: the EPYC Embedded 3000 and the Ryzen Embedded V1000 processors to enable a new class of thin client, IoT and other embedded solutions.","In closing, we are extremely pleased with our first quarter financial results and strong product execution. We believe 2018 is shaping up to be an excellent year for AMD, with continued revenue growth and margin expansion driven by significant demand for our high-performance Ryzen, Radeon and EPYC products.","Looking forward, we are confident that we have the right long-term strategy to deliver sustained revenue and profitability growth. The market TAM in high-performance computing will grow to over $75 billion over the next few years, including high-growth segments like gaming, data center, machine learning and artificial intelligence.","We have built a strong execution engine, and we will continue to make significant investments in hardware and software to deliver an even more compelling roadmap for our customers in 2019 and beyond.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder, to provide some additional color on our first quarter financial performance.","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter was a strong quarter for AMD. Year-over-year, we grew revenue 40%, expended gross margin by more than 400 basis points, significantly improved net income and earnings per share and achieved GAAP and non-GAAP net profitability.","Total revenue of $1.65 billion was driven by strong demand for our new products, with Ryzen and Radeon products growing double-digit percentage year-on-year, Ryzen sales coming in higher-than-expected and EPYC server processors ramping. Gross margin was 36%, up 420 basis points year-on-year, driven by a higher proportion of revenue from new products.","Operating expenses were $446 million compared to $371 million a year ago. Operating expenses were 27% of revenue, lower than our prior guidance of 28%, and down 4 percentage points from 31% a year ago, as we continue to make strategic R&D investments, launch new products and invest in our multi-generation product roadmaps.","Operating income was $152 million, up sharply from $34 million a year ago, and operating margin was 9%, up from 3% a year ago. Net income was $121 million or diluted earnings of $0.11 per share as compared to a net income of $2 million a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was $196 million compared to $68 million a year ago and on a trailing 12-month basis adjusted EBITDA was $496 million.","Now, turning to the first quarter business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $1.12 billion, up 95% year-over-year due to strong sales of both Radeon and Ryzen products. Our Ryzen offerings outperformed our expectations in Q1, accounting for approximately 60% of client processor revenue and contributed to strong sequential double-digit percentage growth in client revenue. The strength in Radeon products was driven by both gaming and blockchain demand. We believe blockchain was approximately 10% of AMD revenue in Q1 2018.","Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $138 million compared to a loss of $21 million a year ago. This significant turnaround was due to strong revenue growth and improved operating expense leverage.","Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $532 million, down 12% year-over-year, with lower semi-custom revenue partially offset by higher server and embedded revenue. As a reminder, revenue in both Q1 2018 and Q1 2017 include semi-custom revenue related to quarter-end inventory, associated with non-cancelable purchase orders as required under the ASC 606 revenue accounting standard.","EESC operating income was $14 million, down from $55 million a year ago, primarily due to a licensing gain in Q1 2017, as well as increased operating expense investments in our data center business.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.04 billion at the end of the quarter, down from $1.18 billion in Q4, and up from $943 million in the year ago quarter. Free cash flow was negative $132 million in the first quarter. Inventory was $715 million, up slightly from the prior quarter.","Total principal debt, including our secured revolving line of credit, was $1.7 billion. We deployed cash to repurchase $14 million of debt in the first quarter, as we continue to reduce term debt and interest expense.","Now, turning to our financial outlook: For the second quarter of 2018, AMD expects revenue to be approximately $1.725 billion, plus or minus $50 million. This is an increase of 50% year-over-year, driven by the growth of Ryzen, Radeon, EPYC and semi-custom revenue. On a sequential basis, we expect Q2 revenue to benefit from continued strength in our Ryzen and EPYC product families and a seasonal increase in semi-custom revenue, partially offset by a modest decline in graphics due to blockchain.","As a reminder, for comparative purposes, Q2 2017 revenue was $1.15 billion under the ASC 606 revenue accounting standard. In addition, for Q2 2018, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 37%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $460 million or 27% of revenue, non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other, to be approximately $35 million and inventory to be up slightly on a sequential basis in support of higher revenue.","Our financial progress in the first quarter is attributable to the ongoing strength of Radeon and Ryzen products, as well as continued early contributions from our EPYC products. Our business is strong, and we look forward to continued revenue growth, margin expansion and increased profitability year-over-year.","Based on the strength of our business momentum, for the full year 2018, we now expect revenue to increase by mid-20s percent over 2017, driven by the ramp of our new products. Blockchain revenue to be mid to high-single-digit percentage of revenue for 2018. Non-GAAP gross margin to be greater than 37%.","In summary, the first quarter was excellent. We are pleased with the momentum in our business execution and strong financial results, which we believe lay the foundation for a strong 2018. We are focused on delivering our long-term target financial model, as we execute our multi-generational roadmaps and introduce and ramp high-performance computing products.","With that, I'll turn it back to Laura for the Q&A session. Laura?","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you very much. Appreciate that, Devinder. Operator, we're ready to go.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question today is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now live.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong results, especially on getting to the double-digit op margins in your Computing and Graphics segment. it's been awhile since we saw that.","For my first question, Lisa, on EPYC server sales, you mentioned they doubled sequentially. If you could give us some sense of what the magnitude is, so we at least have some ballpark sense of where you are right now. But importantly, what are the remaining pushbacks from customers, in terms of what they would like to see before they adopt EPYC in a more meaningful way, is it just a matter of time? Is it a performance or a pricing gap, or what else do you need to deliver on to get EPYC to a more meaningful level?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah, absolutely, Vivek. Thanks for the question. So look, on EPYC, we did make a very nice progress in the quarter. I think when you look at it from a revenue standpoint, it's strong double-digit percentage. There's \u2013 we certainly view that the units increasing is also a very positive thing. The traction actually is across all areas. So we saw traction in Enterprise sort of end user deployments. We saw some channel and system integrator deployments as well as hyperscale deployments.","And our goal is to get to mid-single-digit share by the end of this year. I think we are making good progress towards that. What we're working with customers now is just going through their various stages of qualifications. So they go from proof-of-concept to initial deployment then to large volume deployment. And we're in that initial deployment phase.","And so, I think we're making good progress, and it is \u2013 there are no real pushbacks other than just time going through the qualification process and working with them in their environments to make sure that we get fully qualified.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And as a follow-up, if I look at your server ASPs in the past, they were sort of in the $300 to $400 range, well below what your competitor had. As you look at a lot of these engagements that you're participating in now, how should we think about pricing trends that you're seeing in that market? Are you able to sell in a higher value segment than you were able to do in the past?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes. So Vivek, I think the very strong part of our roadmap right now is we're really playing across the entire portfolio. So from, let's call it, the low-end of the server market, the entry-level, all the way through the high-end 2P SKUs. So the pricing that we're seeing in the market is very reasonable. From our standpoint, they are \u2013 we are providing value to the customer, but they're also very accretive to the margins of our overall business. So the pricing environment is good.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thanks, Lisa. Thanks, Vivek. Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First question on the Ryzen notebook effort, it sounds like it's really starting to hit its stride. And I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color, which segments does it seem to resonate with, to what extent, is it a commercial versus a consumer product? And do you think that the Ryzen notebook opportunity, is it bigger than the desktop opportunity ultimately in your minds? Thank you.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes, Mark. So look, we're making very good progress on Ryzen. I think we're very pleased with the Q1 results, and then, what we see going into Q2 in the second half. It is true that up until this quarter, much of our progress has been in the channel and in the desktop portion of the business. We saw a nice increase this quarter in notebooks and what it is is many of the OEMs are actually launching systems in Q2. And with that, we had \u2013 they're basically building up their production for the second quarter launches.","What you're going to see in second quarter is a number of impressive premium consumer designs, thin and light designs that I think are representative of the strength of the product. And we will also see the first launch of the commercial systems from the top OEMs and the expectation is that the commercial notebooks will kick in in the second half of the year. Q2 is more of a consumer cycle.","But overall, I think we're seeing that the notebook OEM opportunity is a good one. We have strong design wins. The customers are working closely with us. We're doing a lot of work with retailers and the overall go-to-market to ensure that the notebook opportunity is important and notebook is larger than desktop overall.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Okay, great. That's helpful. And a follow-up, if I may. On EPYC, the product has been in the market for a while. I understand that you have to go through the testing phase, and then, pilot programs and initial deployments, and then, hopefully, larger scale deployments. How do you think or how should we think about the cadence of updates on this product? Is this a similar cadence that you would see on the desktop or notebook side? Thank you.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Sure, Mark. So on the server side, the cadence of deployments does tend to be longer. I think we're well into the cadence. And so, I think the EPYC work with the OEMs, you saw the combination of that with HPE announcing in December, and then, Dell announcing in the first quarter, that will now move over into Enterprise customers who are then taking their systems into their labs and doing their initial deployments. So I think the cadence is over a number of quarters.","I will say for the first-generation EPYC, we're seeing really nice customer interest, and it's quite broad. And so, it is across Enterprise as well as the hyperscale customers. And we view this as a multi-generational play. So we're very excited about what EPYC can do over the next couple of quarters. But we also believe that this is the right investment to make with the customer set, as we bring out the second-generation of EPYC and the third generation of EPYC, obviously, it would go a little bit faster, because the customer set is familiar with our system.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the strong results, Lisa and Devinder. Devinder, impressive year-over-year gross margin growth in the March quarter of 400 basis points. I'm just kind of curious, clearly, Ryzen has had a positive impact. Can you help break down the 400 basis points year-on-year growth between kind of new products and the fact that semi-custom sort of declined as a percent of the mix pretty significantly from 2017 to 2018? And then, how do we think about the incremental margin leverage as EPYC comes in and perhaps Ryzen too?","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes, good question, John. Actually, if you look at it from a margin standpoint year-over-year, the semi-custom revenue was actually down, so that was helpful. But beyond that, if you look at the new products, fundamentally, the new products is what's driving the margin. Ryzen, EPYC, GPU Compute, which are all higher than corporate average, those are all driving the increase in the margin.","And as we get to the rest of the year as you observed, the momentum in the products is there for the new products. They're going to go ahead and contribute to the margin increase and that's why, from prior guidance, we just updated our margin to, say, maybe you said greater than 36% the last time, we updated to, say, greater than 37% this time for the year and that's fundamentally all with the momentum that we have for the new products.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","That's helpful, Devinder. And then, Lisa, as my follow-up, I appreciate kind of quantifying blockchain for both the first quarter and for last year and also your commentary about it being it looks like down sequentially at least in embedded in your June guidance. I'm just kind of curious, just given how hard it is to track where these GPUs are really going, how do you get a sense of what's a blockchain application versus something else, one?","And two, do you see this as a viable long-term market or do you believe that as this market develops, it's going to have to move from proof of work to proof of stake which might just negate mining altogether? And if that scenario were to play out, how worried are you about sort of secondary cards coming back into the market and kind of hurting pricing either in the second half of this year or into 2019?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Sure, John. So look, on the blockchain there is a lot of discussion about this. From our standpoint, we stay very, very close to the customer set in the graphics space. And so, we spend time with the commercial miners as well as spending time with our partners.","And the way we look at this, our first priority when we look at allocation of graphics cards is to gamers. And so that's through OEMs, that's through system integrators, that's also working with key e-tailers to make sure that they are prioritizing the gamers segment and we're going to continue to do that. And so, that's one piece that we know well.","We also work directly with the commercial miners, and so, we see kind of what their forecasts are and they work with us and so that we have good visibility on. There is a piece that go through retail that is hard to tell whether that's gaming or mining, but we believe we have a good sense of what that is. So it is an approximation, but we think it's a good approximation of where we are.","And then, to your longer-term question, I do think the blockchain infrastructure is here to stay. I think there are numerous currencies. There are numerous applications that are using the blockchain technology. We don't see a significant risk of secondhand GPUs coming into the market. I think what you find is that, one, there are number of different currencies, and, two, a lot of these users that are buying GPUs these days are actually buying them for multiple use cases, both commercial and consumer. So they're not necessarily buying just for mining.","And I think for that reason, we do think this is a different cycle. That being the case, we do see a bit of volatility and that's why we are putting into our forecast for the second quarter and the second half a little bit lower blockchain demand, but that's more than made up for by the other new products and the way the new products are ramping in the business.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","That's great. Thanks, Lisa. I really appreciate it.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thanks, John. Operator, next question.","Operator","Certainly. Our next question is coming from David Wong from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Could you give us some idea of what your June guidance assumes in terms of sequential microprocessor sales growth compared to discrete graphics growth?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Sure, David. So in our second quarter guidance, we're actually assuming that Ryzen and EPYC are up, and semi-custom is also up seasonally, and we expect graphics to be down modestly based on some of the blockchain demand.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Excellent. Could you give us an update on what new products you plan to launch through the rest of this year and next year? And when these are scheduled to come out?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Sure. That's a lot, David, but let me say a couple things. I think, relative to our CPU business, I mean we are launching additional Ryzen-based products in the second half of the year. We just launched the second-generation Ryzen desktop in 12-nanometer and that launch has gone really well. I mean, we're very happy with the positioning and how customers are reacting to that. In the second half, we'll have some commercial systems and some other updates to our Ryzen lineup that we will launch.","We have a 7-nanometer GPU based on Vega that we'll sample later this year. We have a 7-nanometer server CPU that we'll sample later this year. And then, obviously, we have a number of products that are planned for 2019 as well. So it's a very, very busy product season for us. But we're pleased with the sort of the execution on the product roadmap.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, Lisa.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is now live.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Firstly, on OpEx, are you still looking for a 28% of revenue for the full year on a higher revenue base? And given that \u2013 if that's so, what areas are kind of key for investment on this as we go through the rest of the year and going forward?","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah. Let me take that, and then, Lisa can add. So yes, we are targeting 28%. As you've seen, Stacy, we had a long-term target model of 26%, 30%. The year has started out well. We came in at 27% in Q1 and targeting around the same for Q2. But we are still in investment mode, and obviously, investing in R&D and the product roadmap. And Lisa can maybe add some of the details in terms of where we are investing in terms of OpEx.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah. Sure, Stacy. So I think from the investment side, certainly, we're investing in R&D on the CPU and the GPU side, but a key focus for us is in software, and particularly, machine learning software. I think there's a high demand of people wanting to use our GPUs in the compute space. And so, we're increasing our investments in software around machine learning.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you. For my follow-up, I had a question on the ASC 606. I know last quarter you kind of gave some historicals for how that was a headwind versus a tailwind versus what would have been normal seasonality, particularly in semi-custom. Is the ASC 606 in the Q2 \u2013 is that a headwind or tailwind on the guide? And how should we think about that as we go through the second half as well versus what we would have seen without the accounting change?","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah. Fundamentally, ASC 606, from a revenue standpoint, what happens is the seasonality and the profile of the semi-custom revenue changes. Some of the revenue that we used to get in the second half moved to the first half, so I would say, it's a little bit more balanced between the first half and the second half, as opposed to the peak revenue we used to see in Q3. So that is the primary effect on the profile of the revenue, not necessarily the annual revenue.","ASC 606 has not had any significant impact on our annual revenue. It's more of the profile of the revenue within the quarters. As far as impact is concerned, if you're comparing year-over-year, for example, in Q1 of 2018, semi-custom was down, because we had more revenue in Q1 of 2017, and in Q2, it is slightly up, but very balanced from where we see it from an overall standpoint.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So last year in Q2, it was like \u2013 I forget how much, like a $75 million headwind versus what would have been otherwise? Is it a similar amount of headwind this time in Q2 or is it less? Or is it a tailwind?","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","I would say that it was a headwind last year. This year, from an overall standpoint, if I compare year-over-year, it is up slightly from where we were in Q2 of 2018. So if you're comparing Q2 2017 to Q2 2018, it's a benefit to the revenue in Q2 of 2018 in our guidance.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you, Stacy. Go ahead.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is now live.","Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. I had two. I'm curious about your comments just now on blockchain, and I'm a little surprised to hear as you think that there would be limited risk that that product would come back into the market. Can you again go over why you think that is, because you're selling more of a general SKU, right? And then, I guess, also, how you handicap the potential for there to be some ASP effect on that too? I know you've captured some of the rising ASPs in the channel, so how do you handicap that looking out throughout the rest of the year? Thanks.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah. Absolutely, Tim. Look, so when you look at, I think, most people are comparing sort of this blockchain time period to the last one which was a couple of years ago and I think there are a couple of important differences. I think the first one is that there are multiple currencies and multiple applications that are being used. And what we've seen is that people who are mining do go from one currency to another depending on what's happening.","We're also seeing that many users, on both the commercial and consumer side, are actually buying GPUs for multiple use cases. And from that standpoint, again, we see that there is good demand for, not just blockchain, but for gaming, for the cloud and for those things as well. So I think it's a balanced assessment of where we are. I think the breadth of the blockchain applications and also the breadth of the customer base give us that belief.","Now, as you go forward, there's also a \u2013 when we look at the Graphics business go forward minus blockchain, we actually see a very good environment. We see a good environment for gaming growing, we see a good environment for GPU Compute growing, and frankly, on the gaming side, some of those users have not been able to get access to GPUs, and so, again, that's \u2013 those are all positives as we go forward.","And then, you had a second question, Tim?","Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC","I did, yeah. I think you said that the 7-nanometer product is in the lab, and it's going to launch later this year. That's the product at TSMC, correct? And I guess, I'm just wondering on that front do you feel comfortable that you can get capacity from that vendor. Thanks.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","So our foundry strategy is to use both TSMC and GLOBALFOUNDRIES on the first 7-nanometer product. We are using TSMC for that product and we have a very strong relationship with them. And so, we do see a good momentum on it from what we see, and I'm not concerned about capacity.","Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you so much.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thanks, Tim.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good afternoon. And solid job on the quarterly execution. Just a follow-up on the semi-custom business, on the June quarter guide, you mentioned sequential growth in semi-custom. But if I look at your ASC 606 reconciliations for last year, it looks like the semi-custom business was actually down double-digits percentage points sequentially going from Q1 to Q2. So like-for-like on the 606, why the different shipment profile this year, Q1 to Q2?","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah, I can explain that. So in Q1 of 2017, there was a strategic buy of wafers that we did in Q1 2017. So it had a bigger impact in Q1 2017. And then, the effect caught up in Q2. So the impact Q1 to Q2 was significant. This year, it's more balanced, and from that standpoint, when you compare year-over-year, Q1 to Q1, it's down, but Q2 to Q2, it's up. So there was a different profile in Q1 2017 just based on the way the wafers are purchased in 2017 as opposed to 2018 where it's a little bit more balanced.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for the insights there. Question for Lisa. Embedded solutions contributed to the year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter growth in EESC. I think that this is kind of an often overlooked part of the business, because embedded is nice, because it gives you guys exposure to kind of a diverse set of the market applications. Can you just help us understand where the team is seeing good demand traction in embedded and maybe give us a rough idea on kind of overall revenue contribution to EESC?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes, Harlan. So yeah, embedded is a nice segment. You're absolutely right. I think it's a margin accretive segment to us. The end markets that we ship into there are thin clients, they are places where you need graphics for displays, so there's some embedded displays that we ship into there.","It's still a small business for us, but we actually believe, in addition to the goodness around Ryzen and EPYC, when we launch those products, Ryzen and EPYC embedded, we actually saw very strong interest from customers. And so, we think as the products strength in our PC and in our server business increase, they will also help that embedded solutions business overall.","So I would say it's still a small piece of the business, but we believe it will be a nice growing margin accretive portion of the business over the next couple of years.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Srini Pajjuri from Macquarie. Your line is now live.","Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. Lisa, a question on the ASPs. I think you said the ASPs went up because of the Ryzen mix improving. Could you give us some more color as to where Ryzen is in terms of mix? And then, with the Ryzen 2, do you expect that to be accretive to ASPs and margins?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah. So in terms of the client business, we saw units up overall. We saw ASPs up overall and they were up in both desktop and mobile. And when you look underneath that, I think what the main thing is we're seeing a larger mix of the business become Ryzen. So in the fourth quarter, we had stated that the Ryzen mix of the client business was kind of in the low-40s. And so, we had notebook, a lot of legacy product that we're still shipping and in desktop, we had some legacy product that we're still shipping.","As we move over to the first quarter, the notebook mix has mixed nicely into Ryzen, and the desktop is now mixed very nicely into Ryzen as well. So overall, that's what led to the ASP increase.","I think the second generation Ryzen is a very, very good product. I think it's \u2013 it actually \u2013 when you look at the first-generation Ryzen, we were very good on multi-threaded performance, but there were some detractors around single-threaded and gaming performance. I think the second-generation Ryzen is actually much more competitive on gaming performance. So we do see an opportunity for that to help us increase share in the desktop business, and certainly, that would be accretive to margin.","Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. And then, one question on the server business, I guess, your target is to get to mid-single-digit share by end of this year, which is fairly gradual ramp. Just curious as to when you expect the 7-nanometer part to be available in the market and when that happens, do you see an inflection to your share gains or do you continue to expect gradual share gains? Thank you.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah. So all of the sales this year will be around the current generation of Ryzen, and so, that gets us to the mid-single-digit share. 7-nanometer Zen 2 based product we'll sample later this year to customers and that will be in production in 2019, and we do believe that the adoption rate of the second-generation could potentially be higher than the adoption rate of the first-generation, mostly because customers will be more familiar with our systems and our products. And so, we'll see how it goes, but we certainly \u2013 our overall goals are ambitious in the server space. And so, this year, it's first-generation Ryzen; next year, we'll mix in the 7-nanometer second-generation \u2013 I'm sorry, first-generation EPYC, and next year, we'll mix in the second-generation of the EPYC products.","Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thanks, Srini.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Perhaps your phone is on mute. Toshiya Hari, you're line is live. Perhaps your phone is on mute on your end.","Charles Long - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Charles calling in for Toshiya. Hello.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Go ahead, Charles.","Charles Long - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hello. Yes, sorry about that. Thanks for taking the time. I had a \u2013 my first question is on the competitive landscape in the AI space. So just wondering how you're thinking about your positioning, relative to not only your biggest competitor there in NVIDIA, but also new entrants that could potentially be working on custom solutions. And then, I have a follow-up.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Sure. So the AI market is certainly growing very, very fast relative to the competitive landscape, we are a new entrant. I think our GPU Compute hardware is very good. I think we have a strong roadmap that we are putting in place for that. I think on the software side, we have more work to do, and we are making significant investments in some of the machine learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow and Caffe, and some of these key frameworks to ensure that we make it easier to adopt our solutions.","But we see this as a multi-year, really, opportunity for us. So GPU Compute will continue to be a focus area for us. We think we can be very competitive and we're going to continue to invest in this area.","As it relates to, let's call it, non-GPU solutions, I think there will \u2013 the landscape says there will be some ASIC solutions in the marketplace, but I view that as complementary to the GPU solutions. And from that standpoint, I think we have CPUs, we have GPUs, and then, we have the ability to connect heterogeneously to these other elements. So from our standpoint again, we see this as a market that very much fits our capability and we will continue to invest in it.","Charles Long - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you. And then, my follow-up's on the upcoming shareholder meeting. I know one of the proposals is to increase the authorized share authorization by about 700 million shares. Obviously, my understanding is that that wouldn't be dilutive initially. But just wondering how you're thinking about potential uses of that share is.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes. So you're correct. There is a proposal at the shareholder meeting. It is not going to be dilutive to begin with, and it's really good housekeeping. We don't have any particular plans at this point.","Charles Long - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thanks, Charles. Next question.","Operator","Certainly. Our next question is coming from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now live.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Thank you very much. I had two questions. One was just a follow-up to what Lisa you were talking about on the machine learning side. When do we see \u2013 so just give us an update of where you are in traction and should we expect any meaningful revenues on that front from AMD in this year?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes. So I think last year, we announced a partnership with Baidu to do software optimizations for machine learning. And we have several other partnerships with others in this area. So there's a lot of interest. I think the time for meaningful revenue \u2013 we will see some revenue in the second half of the year that's part of the growth in the margin expansion story. And I think into 2019 and 2020, this will continue to be an area of growth for us.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then, for my follow-up, just getting back to the discrete graphics in the quarter reported, the channel was really dry heading into the first quarter. So where are we on the channel inventory? And is there any way for you to help us understand how much of the growth was driven by the buildup in the channel in the March quarter? Thank you.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes. So the channel inventory was at very, very low levels going into the quarter, and frankly, it was hard to get the GPU. It was hard to get GPUs. I think if you look now on typical retailer and e-tailer sites, the channel inventory is good. And I think there was an element of channel replenishment, but from what we see at the inventory levels today, they're, I would say, normal.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And what is the normal level, Lisa, in terms of weeks?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Maybe somewhere between four and five weeks.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you very much.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Hans Mosesmann from Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Hans Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Lisa, a couple of questions. Can you comment qualitatively about the competitive dynamic that you're seeing in microprocessors? And as a second question, can you give us an update on Spectre, in terms of the impact it's had on the business going forward? Thanks.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Sure, Hans. So on the microprocessor side, I think the competitive landscape, as we see it, Ryzen and EPYC are very competitive. And we've seen that in head-to-head design opportunities. I think from a CPU standpoint, we're very pleased with that. I think second-generation Ryzen in 12-nanometer actually improves the overall performance, and so, we like how that positions us on the PC side.","I think as we look forward, and I think this is important, we believe that the 7-nanometer capability of the foundry ecosystem is very good, and that puts us in a good competitive spot from a manufacturing standpoint. And then, on the design side, obviously, we have things that we're planning. And so, I see the competitive environment as one that is as good and we're going to work very hard to make sure that it gets better over time. Obviously, we take the competition very seriously.","Oh, yes, and the second question, sorry about that, Hans, on Spectre. We have spent a good amount of time with our customer set to make sure that they're fully protected on Spectre. We've actually released a number of software mitigations already to our OEM customers and to our partners. They're in their process of deploying. So I think it took a lot of energy. Certainly, we spent a lot of time on it and our customers had to spend time on it. But we don't see any long-term effects. It's more that we want to make sure to get the work done quickly, and that's been our focus.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thanks, Lisa. Thanks, Hans. Operator, we have time for two more questions, please.","Operator","Certainly. Our next question is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your line is now live.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you, I think you mentioned double-digit sequential growth in the CPU business. I was just kind of curious what stage you're on in terms of channel fill for the Ryzen mobile business? And then, I've one more follow-up.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes. So we did, as I mentioned, have some mobile product shipped ahead of OEM system launches in the second quarter. But we see this really as the beginning of the Ryzen ramp. So my expectation is that the client or the Ryzen portion of our business will be up in the second quarter, and it will be up in the second half. And so, it's the beginning of the notebook ramp.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And then, I wanted to ask some of the OpEx side, Devinder, just in terms of licensing gains that have been in OpEx offset, do you expect any of those gains this year?","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","I think there could be, but it's hard to tell, because it's kind of dependent upon the milestones that come into play. That was the OpEx offset last year that got reversed, but we'll see when it happens from a milestone standpoint.","Lisa T.

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Laura Graves. Please go ahead.","Laura Graves","Thank you and welcome to AMD's second quarter 2019 conference call. By now, you should've had the opportunity to review a copy of our earnings release and slides. If you have not reviewed these documents, they can be found on the Investor Relations page of AMD's website, amd.com. Participants on today's conference call are Dr. Lisa Su, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Devinder Kumar, our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. This is a live call and will be replayed via webcast on our website.","Before we begin, I would like to highlight some important dates for you. AMD will officially launch our second-generation EPYC Datacenter CPU on Wednesday, August 7th. On Tuesday, August 27th, Forrest Norrod, Senior Vice President and General Manager of our Data Center and Embedded Solutions Group will present at the Jefferies 2019 Semiconductor Hardware & Communications Infrastructure Summit in Chicago. On Tuesday, September 10th, Devinder Kumar, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer will present at the Deutsche Bank Technology Conference in Las Vegas; and on Friday, September 13th, 2019, our third quarter quiet time is expected to begin at the close of business.","Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of this current date and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We will refer primarily to non-GAAP financial measures during this call except for revenue and segment operational results, which are on a GAAP basis.","The non-GAAP financial measures referenced today are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in today's press release, which is posted on our website. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our press release for more information. You will also find detailed discussions about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC and, in particular, AMD's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 30th, 2019.","Now with that, I would like to hand the call over to Lisa. Lisa?","Lisa Su","Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. We made history in the second quarter both as the first Company to simultaneously launch high performance CPUs and GPUs, and the first to ramp 7-nanometer high-performance processors across PCs, gaming and the data center. I am extremely pleased with our execution in the quarter as we ramped production on Ryzen 3000 CPUs, Radeon 5700 GPUs and early volumes of our second-generation EPYC processors in advance of their third quarter launch.","Looking at the second quarter, revenue of $1.53 billion increased 20% sequentially driven by growth across both of our business segments. Revenue declined 13% year-over-year in line with our expectations as clients and server processor revenue increases were offset by lower graphics channel and semi-custom revenue.","Turning to our Computing and Graphics segment, revenue declined 13% year-over-year, as significantly higher client processor sales were offset by lower graphics channel sales. Mobile client processor revenue increased by a double-digit percentage year-over-year and sequentially, driven by our highest quarterly unit shipments in five years. In desktop, we launched our industry-leading Ryzen 3000 processors, featuring our new Zen 2 core to overwhelmingly positive customer response.","Numerous third-party reviews highlighted the superior performance of our 7-nanometer Ryzen CPUs in both multi threaded and single threaded applications, while consuming less power than competitive offerings. Ryzen 3000 processor customer demand has been very strong with sales at global e-tailers and retailers outpacing our previous generations of Ryzen by more than three times at the same point following their respective launches. Based on the market response to our latest mobile and desktop processors and the growing number of AMD powered commercial and consumer PCs, we expect to gain share in the high volume back-to-school and holiday periods.","In Graphics, revenue decreased year-over-year, driven largely by lower channel sales, partially offset by a significant increase in data center GPU sales. GPU revenue increased by a double-digit percentage sequentially driven by increased channel sales of our RX 500 series GPUs and the launch of our Radeon 5700 family. The Radeon 5700 series with our new RDNA architecture delivers up to 1.5 times more performance per watt compared to our previous generation. Initial demand for our new GPUs has been strong as third-party reviewers have highlighted our leadership gaming performance at relevant price points.","We are well positioned for growth in the second half of the year as we continue to ramp our Radeon 5000 GPU family. We had another quarter of strong year-over-year data center GPU sales growth, driven largely by HPC and cloud wins.","We continue making progress expanding this margin accretive part of our business based on our strategy to focus on working closely with marquee customers.","We also announced a strategic partnership in the quarter with Samsung to bring Radeon graphics to their future smartphone and mobile SoCs. The partnership showcases our strategy to engage with industry leaders across the ecosystem to drive Radeon everywhere. We now have deep partnerships across the PC, game console, cloud and mobile markets that contribute to a growing developer ecosystem and installed base for our Radeon graphics architecture.","Turning to our Enterprise Embedded and Semi Custom segment, revenue decreased 12% from a year ago due to lower Semi Custom revenue. In semi custom, we have extended our game console leadership as both Microsoft and Sony have now both announced they will use custom AMD SoCs to power their next generation game consoles. We are very proud to power back to back generations of the world's highest performing game consoles.","As we look into the second half of the year, we are seeing additional softness in game console demand, which is now reflected in our full year guidance. In server, CPU revenue grew significantly year-over-year and sequentially driven by initial shipments of our next-generation Rome processors to lead cloud and OEM customers. First generation EPYC processor based cloud deployments continue to increase in the quarter.","Amazon expanded availability of its EPYC processor powered instances to more than 15 regions and dozens of new configurations. And Microsoft launched general availability of its Azure HB supercomputing virtual machines that for the first time ever enabled customers to run demanding HPC workloads in the cloud.","Turning to our next-generation Rome server processor, Rome is on time and exceeding expectations, delivering leadership performance and TCO across a significantly expanded number of cloud and enterprise workloads. Customer excitement continues to grow. Compared to our first-generation EPYC processors, we have more than twice the number of platforms in development with a larger set of partners. We also have four times more enterprise and cloud customers actively engaged on deployments prior to launch. As a result, Rome is on track to ramp significantly faster than our first-generation EPYC processor.","We are seeing particular strength in HPC where we offer leadership compute density and IO. We had multiple supercomputing wins in the quarter, including public announcements from Indiana University and Norway's National Research Network. Our supercomputing momentum was highlighted by the US Department of Energy and Oak Ridge National Laboratory selecting both epic CPUs and Radeon instinct GPUs to power their next-generation Frontier exascale supercomputer built by Cray. Frontier is expected to be the world\u2019s fastest computer when it launches in 2021. We look forward to providing more details on Rome at our launch events on August 7th.","In summary, as we complete the first half of 2019, we have reached a significant inflection point for the Company as we enter our next phase of growth with the most competitive product portfolio in our history. We have seen some uncertainties across our supply chain driven by tariffs, trade concerns in the US entities list. In the second quarter we stopped shipping to customers added to the US entities list.","While we remain cautious given the fluidity of the situation, the impact to date has been limited and offset by growing momentum in other parts of our business. We are executing well to our plans and see a path to significant market share gains for our product portfolio across the PC, gaming and data center markets in the coming quarters.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our second quarter financial performance.","Devinder Kumar","Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased with the financial results for the first half of 2019, which provide a solid foundation for the second half of the year. Second quarter revenue of $1.53 billion, grew 20% over the first quarter. Gross margin of 41% increased 4 percentage points from the prior year driven by the ramp of our strong portfolio of high performance products.","Quarterly revenue was down 13% from a year ago. Strong sales of Ryzen and EPYC processor and our new Radeon RX 5700 GPUs were more than offset by lower semi-custom sales and lower graphics channel sales associated with blockchain.","Operating expenses grew 10% year-over-year to $512 million driven primarily by go-to-market activities and new product introductions. Operating income was $111 million, down from $186 million a year ago, primarily due to lower revenue and higher operating expenses. Operating margin was 7%, down from 11% a year ago. Net income was $92 million compared to $156 million a year ago, and diluted earnings per share was $0.08 per share compared to $0.14 per share a year ago.","Now turning to the business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $940 million, down 13% year-over-year, as strong client processor sales were more than offset by lower overall graphics sales due to negligible blockchain-related revenue in the second quarter of 2019. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $22 million compared to $117 million a year ago, primarily due to lower revenue.","In the Enterprise Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue was $591 million, down 12% from the prior year. Semi-custom revenue was lower and partially offset by significant growth in data center CPU revenue. EESC segment operating income was $89 million compared to $69 million a year ago. The improvement was largely due to growth in data center CPU revenue.","Turning to the balance sheet, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.1 billion at the end of the quarter. Year-over-year, we have reduced gross debt by $392 million and in the second quarter, we also replaced our asset-backed loan facility with a $500 million secured revolving line of credit. Free cash flow was negative $28 million in the quarter, while cash flow from operations was $30 million.","Inventory was $1 billion, up $60 million sequentially primarily due to increased inventory of our new 7-nanometer products in anticipation of accelerating product sales in the back half of the year. Adjusted EBITDA was $163 million compared to $228 million a year ago due to lower quarterly earnings. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted EBITDA was $672 million and gross leverage at the end of the quarter was 1.9 times.","Turning to the outlook for the third quarter of 2019. We expect revenue to be approximately $1.8 billion plus or minus $50 million, an increase of approximately 9% year-over-year and 18% sequentially. The sequential and year-over-year increases are expected to be driven by Ryzen, EPYC and Radeon product sales, partially offset by lower than expected semi-custom sales. In addition, for Q3, 2019, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 43%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $525 million, non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $30 million and third quarter diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.21 billion shares .","For the full year, we now believe revenue will increase mid-single digit percent over 2018, driven by significant sales growth of our new Ryzen, EPYC and Radeon processors, partially offset by lower than expected semi-custom revenue. Revenue excluding semi-custom is expected to increase approximately 20% year-over-year. Full year non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 42%. In closing, we had a strong first half of 2019. We remain focused on executing to our plans for the remainder of the year and look forward to ramping our new Ryzen and Radeon products as well as the upcoming launch of Rome.","With that has done it back to Laura for the question-and-answer session. Laura?","Laura Graves","Thank you, Devinder. Operator, we're ready for our first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live.","Mitch Steves","Yes, sorry. Yeah. So my question is really just two, first on the gross margin side. So you guys are talking about semi-custom coming down pretty materially and that's the kind of the entire reason for the -- I guess the mid single digit growth numbers, so why I guess aren't the gross margins expanding a little bit more, if you're seeing more traction on the server side?","Devinder Kumar","I think if you look at it from an overall standpoint ,in Q2, we did 41% in the third quarter in a row of 41% gross margin and in Q3 you're right, with the decline in semi-custom there is benefit to the margin and the margin guide for Q3 is approximately 43%. I can tell you that the richer product mix, especially with the new products ramping in Q3 are going to drive the gross margin, although there is a benefit from the decline of Semi Custom also. The margin benefit is more weighted towards the non-semi custom business and that's where we end up with 43% in Q3. We've also updated our guidance for 2019 and now are projecting 42% for the year 2019.","Mitch Steves","All right. Yes, I guess just to follow up on that. So the assumption there is that by the end of '19 you guys have more share in the server side. So I guess just high level if I assume that 2020 gross margins are going to start going up as well, if you keep gaining share in server, is that a fair assumption for the next year or so?","Devinder Kumar","I think what I would say is we are very pleased with the progress we have made on the margin in 2019. The product mix continues to get richer and we'll see as we get closer to 2020 in terms of the specifics, but you are right, the product mix does get better, so -- and even in the other businesses, including the client business the product mix being richer benefits the margin.","Mitch Steves","Okay, perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your line is now live.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question and good to see the traction and the new products. Lisa for my first question, I was wondering if you could give us some more color around the traction you're seeing and Rome, both from -- if you're able to quantify it somewhat, but importantly the traction you're seeing with customers whether there is any pricing pressure from your main competitor and I think in the past you had outlined targets to reach certain market share, just now that the product is out in front of customers, how are you seeing that traction, with both the cloud and the enterprise side?","Lisa Su","Yeah, absolutely Vivek. Thanks for the question. So look, we are very pleased with how Rome is coming up. We did ship initial shipments this past quarter and the second quarter to both cloud and enterprise customers. The feedback that we're getting from customers is that the performance is very compelling, both from a performance standpoint as well as a total cost of ownership standpoint.","We've gotten a number of wins on both the cloud and the enterprise side as well as HPC. From our standpoint, next week is a big week for us, obviously, we're going to officially launch Rome on August 7. But from a customer pull standpoint we see good customer pull. Your question specifically about the pricing environment, the pricing environment is always competitive. We expect it to be competitive. That being the case in servers price is not the first variable in terms of a buying decision. And so, we believe the value proposition that we have for Rome, from a overall standpoint is very strong and we see good a good pricing environment for that.","Vivek Arya","Thanks, Lisa. And as, as my follow-up on the qualification side, I think in the last quarter you had given us some color around data center CPU and GPU kind of around that mid-teens as a percentage of sales. I was hoping you could give us some sense of what it was in Q2 and just what the outlook is for 2019 or the second half of the year? Thank you.","Lisa Su","Yeah, so in the second quarter the percentage is similar to the last few quarters in terms of percentage of our business. We were more heavily weighted towards CPU versus GPU in the second quarter. So we saw data center GPU sequentially declined as expected. The CPUs grew, as expected. As we go into the second half of the year, you should expect that the percentage of our revenue through the data center will increase as we ramp Rome.","Vivek Arya","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.","Toshiya Hari","Great, thanks so much for taking the question. Lisa, obviously, it seems like you're making a lot of progress with Rome or at least the initial feedback continues to be very positive. That's said the overall hyperscale environment seems pretty slow based on commentary from your peers and your customers, I guess. Could that impact the ramp into the second half? Is that a concern for you going forward? Then I have a follow-up.","Lisa Su","Sure. So look, we certainly have heard the same conversation, especially around the cloud environment in the first half of the year. Our plan was always very heavily second-half weighted. And from our standpoint, we have seen a significant customer engagement and pull for the Rome product and we see a number of new installations that will come online over the next couple of quarters. So I believe that there is some cloud digestion that's happening out there. I also believe that given where we are from the product cycle standpoint, we are well positioned to grow.","Toshiya Hari","Got it and then as a follow-up. I was hoping to learn a little bit more about the partnership with Samsung, the IP win in the quarter and also Frontier on the EPC side, just from a modeling perspective, how should we think about those two deals if you will over the next couple of years and the accretion to the P&L? Thank you.","Lisa Su","Sure. So look, we're very pleased with both. They're both very significant announcements for us. On the Samsung side, it's a multiyear, multigenerational deal that we have across our graphics portfolio for mobile. In terms of 2019, the revenue is approximately $100 million, that would be added. This was not originally in our guidance and it offset some of the headwinds that we talked about in semi custom and in China. As it's not pure IP though, so the way you should think about it is, there is some specific development expenses that are being that are part of that that deal. And so those will be part of the COGS portion of that.","As it relates to Frontier, Frontier again very, very significant deal for us. It is NRE for the next couple of years to really get the software infrastructure. I would say that's not material. It's a relatively smaller number and then the actual deployment will be in 2021. So the bulk of the CPU and the GPU revenue will be in 2021 with a small portion of that perhaps in the second half of 2020.","Toshiya Hari","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matt Ramsay from Cowen & Company. Your line is now live.","Matt Ramsay","Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Lisam I think we'll be hearing plenty about Rome next week. I wanted to ask some questions about your PC business going into the back half of the year. The desktop momentum seems there -- the notebook space, Intel is obviously going on to 10-nanometer for a portion of that portfolio and it seems that 7-nanometer refresh on your side is a little bit later.","Yet the SKU coverage you've talked about I think is 50% higher than it was last year for back-to-school and holidays. So maybe you could talk a little bit about the momentum in the PC business into the back half and the differences between what you might see in desktop and notebook? Thank you.","Lisa Su","Yeah. Sure, Matt. So look, we're pleased with the progress of our PC business. In the second quarter we had notebook perform very well. We saw a ramp of our second-generation mobile product and that is due to some of the additional platforms that we mentioned. Going into the second half of the year on the desktop side, our third-generation Ryzen products are very well positioned. We expect to ramp significant production here in the third quarter and we expect that to lead to share gains.","And we're also feeling quite good about the mobile products into the second half of the year. We've made progress on both consumer and commercial. We have always been strong in consumer, but on the commercial side, we have a number of new platforms as well. And those are ramping here into the second half of the year. So overall, I think the PC business continues to be a good opportunity for us to gain share through the second half of these.","Matt Ramsay","Got it. Thank you. And as a follow-up from me a couple of things for Devinder. I wonder if you might talk about the margin -- or gross margin differential between some of the new 7-nanometer products that you're rolling out versus some of the predecessor products that were either on 12 or 14, just so we can get an understanding of magnitude and before you take that just congrats on cash positive for the Company overall even if -- some of that [indiscernible]","Devinder Kumar","Okay. Yeah, so on the margin side, the new products, as we have said previously in aggregate are greater than 50% margin. And so as we launched the new products in particular on the 7-nanometer node, those are accretive and that's why you see us updating the guidance in terms of the margin, not just for the quarter in Q3, but also for the year. And from that standpoint if the product mix gets richer with more 7-nanometer products ramping, that should benefit the gross margin.","Matt Ramsay","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Hans Mosesmann from Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is now live.","Hans Mosesmann","Thanks, guys, and congrats on the execution with the 7-nanometer. Hey, Lisa, are you guys constraints in terms of 7-nanometer at TSM?","Lisa Su","Hans, yes. So we do have a number of products ramping at TSMC in 7-nanometer and we are not constrained per se. I will say that cycle times of 7-nanometer or longer and so it just takes more time to ramp up, but we are not constrained TSMC has supported us quite well.","Hans Mosesmann","Great, And can you give us a sense if you can on 7-nanometer high-end Navi and mobile 7-nanometer CPUs, if you can? Thanks.","Lisa Su","Hans, you asked the good product questions, I would say they are coming. You should expect that our execution on those are on track and we have a rich 7-nanometer portfolio beyond the products that we have currently announced in the upcoming quarters.","Hans Mosesmann","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Your line is now live.","Mark Lipacis","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Lisa, you have a lot of things working for you at. You got Rome, Ryzen, the GPU portfolio, where you seen the biggest upside surprise on the feedback that you were getting relative to your original expectations?","Lisa Su","Yes, so look, Mark, I think all products have really performed quite well. I think the third-generation Ryzen desktop, both in terms of the reviews -- third party reviews, as well as just the customer interest. What we see is, obviously, it's only been in market for three weeks. And so we watch the data points very carefully, but across the globe, we're seeing sort of significant uptick in our share in the desktop market. I think Navi has come out and positioned very well.","We're very pleased with our RDNA architecture. Navi is the first step and we have a couple of more steps going and then we'll talk much more about EPYC next week. I think the key thing is the products have been on schedule and at\/or above the performance. So our goal is of course, to turn that into revenue growth in the second half of the year.","Mark Lipacis","That's great color. Thank you. And a follow-up if I may. You mentioned the Gen 5 game console wins at Microsoft and Sony. Can you give us a sense, when do these start to ramp? When they ramp, do you book the revenues as you build inventory, as you did the previous generation and is there going to be a -- should we think about anything differently on the gross margin profile? Is it going to be similar to what you've had in the past on these things. So, just some color on the Gen 5 game consoles? Thank you.","Lisa Su","Sure. So Mark, we're proud of the wins at Sony and Microsoft. Those are big wins for us and as you know over many years. We can't comment on specific customers and their ramp profiles. The only thing I will say is, you can expect that in general consumer ramps are second-half weighted, especially weighted towards the holiday season.","So you would expect that. And then as it relates to the gross margin profiles, with our semi-custom business model, I think the margins will be under the corporate average. However, our business model is actually quite different. If you look forward to our business model, the growth that we see across all of our other products Ryzen, EPYC, Radeon is actually quite significant. And so the percentage of semi-custom as a percent of the overall business will be lower than, for example, in the last few years.","Mark Lipacis","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is now live.","Stacy Rasgon","Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. My first one, I want to follow up on that second half gross margin question again. I want to put some numbers behind that. So you're guiding 43% for Q3. Your implied guidance for Q4 is 43% to maybe under, it's only up about 160 bps year-over-year and flat sequentially, but you're guiding Q4 revenue is up over 50% year-over-year and consoles have to be falling like 40% to 50% sequentially.","So the mix must be massively switching over to the new products, that in aggregate have gross margins over 50%. Why are gross margins only been guided up like a 160 bps year-over-year in Q4, given that kind of a revenue trajectory lighter than flat sequentially even with revenues growing over 20% sequentially, quarter-over-quarter into Q4? I just -- I don't understand.","Lisa Su","Yeah, Stacy. Let me start and then maybe Devinder can add to it. So look we guide approximately to the full margin points. What you should expect as we go from Q3 to Q4, is that the product mix will get better. So we will expect more new products and from the standpoint of semi-custom, semi-custom will be down sequentially Q3 to Q4. And so you should expect that we are not implying that the margin will be down in Q4, and we'll get to the Q4 guide as we -- as we get through the next 90 days.","Stacy Rasgon","Okay. For my follow-up, the $100 million from Samsung, does your 20% year-over-year growth excluding the semi-custom, include that $100 million that wasn't in the prior guidance? And what is the impact on the gross margins of that Samsung revenue as well?","Lisa Su","Yeah, so the Samsung additional revenue is included as part of the 20% year-on-year and it offsets some weakness that we have in China. Due to the entities list. As to the gross margin profile, for that, you can expect that to be somewhat above corporate average.","Stacy Rasgon","So somewhat over low '40s?","Lisa Su","Somewhat above corporate average.","Stacy Rasgon","Okay. And it is in the 20%. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.","Aaron Rakers","Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I have one question and a follow-up as well. Just building on that last kind of question. I think last couple of quarters, you've talked about your semi-custom business being down somewhere in the 20% plus range. It looks like, by my math, your assumption now is it that business declines, maybe as much as 40% plus. And so when you parse through that you kind of factor in the Samsung relationship and the incremental $100 million revenue. Has your -- has your estimate at all changed ex those items, meaning revenue ex the semi-custom decline and then also ex the $100 million Samsung?","Lisa Su","Yeah, so let me try to help you Aaron with that math. So look, originally, when we started the year we thought semi-custom would be down, let's call it approximately 20%. In the first half of the year, it was down more than that. And based on what we see today, we would expect the full year now to be down, let's call mid 30s, year-on-year.","If you talk about now the rest of the business, I think the rest of the business is close to where we thought it would be, close, plus or minus a couple of percent and if you think about all of the moving pieces, we do have some customers that we're not shipping to in China, that is offset by the Samsung upside and with the new products and how they're coming in. So I think we are pretty close, plus or minus two where we thought we would be ex those factors.","Aaron Rakers","Okay, that's very helpful and then, just looking at your product segmentation, I'm curious of how you think about the trajectory of the data center, GPU business going forward. Obviously, I can appreciate that could be lumpy, but I'm just trying to understand of how you see that. Is there a point in time where we can actually get some better visibility into that incremental growth driver, our revenue stream going forward? Thank you.","Lisa Su","Yeah, I think that's a fair comment. It is a little bit lumpy because of its size and it's fairly concentrated in a couple of customers. I will say that we're going to see very nice year-over-year growth this year and we see good customer momentum across both cloud as well as HPC. On the cloud side, it is both, let's call it cloud streaming, flash gaming as well as machine learning. And on the HPC side, the Frontier win is a public win, but we have a number of others that we're working as well. So I think we will give more color as we go forward, but it continues to be a business that we feel will be a good growth driver over the next few years.","Aaron Rakers","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from David Wong from Instinet. Your line is now live.","David Wong","Thanks very much. One small clarification and then a second question. Clarification with Samsung $100 million, does that come in on the income statement as a revenue or is it on another line as a special item or something?","Devinder Kumar","It's revenue. So it's revenue and then offset by some specific development cost and also in COGS. And like Lisa said earlier, the margin, when you take the revenue and the COGS offset, is somewhat above corporate average.","David Wong","Okay, excellent. And can you give us any numbers in terms of, for the June quarter, your sequential unit growth in desktop and notebook processor units and the sales growth in PC GPUs?","Lisa Su","Let's see David. So the -- in the -- your question is about the second quarter.","David Wong","That's correct, yes.","Lisa Su","Yes. So in the second quarter, we saw sequentially mobile units up and we saw desktop units down. And the desktop units down is somewhat due to the seasonality in the second quarter as well as the fact that we were going through a product transition as we were preparing for the third generation launch which happened at the very end of the quarter. In terms of graphics, we were up double digits sequentially, and that's both units and revenue statement as it relates to, and that was driven primarily by the graphics channel.","David Wong","Great, thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.","Joe Moore","Great, thank you. So your full guidance mid-single digit, if I sort of project 5%, you need to get to a $2.2 billion number for the December quarter. I guess how literally should I take that? Is there anything -- I understand there's a lot of product momentum, but that still seems like a big number, just anything we should understand in terms of seasonality or things that would kind of give you confidence in mid-single digit for the full year, still?","Lisa Su","Yeah, I think, Joe, our view is that we have significant amount of product launches to happen. So as we go through the third quarter and the fourth quarter, both on the PC side, the GPU side as well as on the server side. So yes, it is significant growth, and I think we feel good about sort of the drivers there.","Joe Moore","Okay, great. That's all I had. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live.","John Pitzer","Yeah, good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask question and congratulations on the solid results. Apologies if I missed this, Lisa. Just going back to the Samsung revenue is that $100 million all coming into the calendar fourth quarter or will there be some in the September quarter as well?","Lisa Su","Yes, John, that $100 million is approximately $100 million for the year. There was a little bit in Q2 and then the rest will be in Q3 and Q4?","John Pitzer","Is there a linearity you can talk about on that or is it -- should we just kind of evenly split it between Q3 and Q4.","Lisa Su","I think that's close.","John Pitzer","Okay and then just a similar question on bridging sort of the gap between your Q3 guide and your full year guide as it pertains to OpEx. If you look at kind of the full year guide you're giving on OpEx, it could imply that our OpEx dollars are actually flat to down sequentially in Q4 on pretty meaningful revenue growth, which is great leverage and understandable in the SG&A line, but I'm just kind of curious how we should be thinking or how you're thinking about the R&D spend as you start to see revenue begin to accelerate again?","Lisa Su","Look, I think you should expect that OpEx should be flattish as we go through the rest of the year. We have increased OpEx, obviously the first half of the year was higher OpEx as a percentage of revenue. We are investing in the right places and I think the product execution shows that. We will evaluate obviously in 2020 as we look through the overall revenue growth picture, what we'll do with OpEx. But I think we've made the right investments and we'll continue to do so.","Devinder Kumar","And John, if you're looking at additional data since you are doing the math, we expect OpEx to be approximately 30% for 2019, if you take Q3 and Q4 into consideration.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live.","Ross Seymore","Hey guys, thanks for letting me ask a question. Lisa, maybe this is something you will address next week in the Rome launch, but in aggregate, now that we're this much closer to the launch in the second half ramp, which you sound very confident on. A year ago, you talked about the market share goals. I think it was double-digit market share four to six quarters after you hit the 5% market share, any sort of update on the timing and\/or comfort around hitting that target?","Lisa Su","Yeah. So I think Ross we feel good about hitting the right target. I'm not ready to update that yet. I think we want to get through. There is a lot of platforms to launch here in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter. We'd like to get through some of that, but we feel that the target is the right target. The product is certainly performing well and now it's about helping our customers get their platforms to market as soon as possible.","Ross Seymore","Got it. Thanks for that. A quick follow up. It was part of a prior question that I don't think I heard the answer to. But is the accounting for the semi-custom ramp, whenever it may occur next year the same in so far as, will you build it? You recognize the revenue. So even if the customer tends to ramp and consumer in the second half of the year, you guys obviously have to build and get the inventory stage etc., much earlier than that and therefore, that would be revenue or does something change accounting wise that that's no longer true?","Lisa Su","Yeah, that was asked earlier and I don't think I responded to it. But the accounting is the same. So I don't think the accounting changes. The only difference though is we tend -- we would not ramp a product prior to qualification. So there are some -- when you're doing a brand new product, there is a more involved qualification cycle. And so I think there would be more commensurate with the actual product shipments.","Ross Seymore","[indiscernible] two things would happen more simultaneously is what you're saying?","Lisa Su","Correct.","Ross Seymore","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now live.","Ambrish Srivastava","Hi, thank you. I also had a clarification. Lisa. I'm not sure I could understand. In the delta for revenues, you talked about semi-custom and then you also said that China is having an impact. What specific product areas are those and is that EPYC is also part of that? And then I had a follow-up for Devinder.","Lisa Su","Yeah. So we did have a small impact due to China. We have several customers that are now on the US entities list and we stopped shipping to those customers in the second quarter. And so it's a small impact, but there is impact that is offset by some of the positives in the rest of the business.","Ambrish Srivastava","So I'm assuming that CPUs, desktop and\/or server both right?","Lisa Su","There is some PC business and there are some server business.","Ambrish Srivastava","Okay, thank you for that. And Devinder, my follow up his on free cash flow. The gap between free cash flow per share, earnings per share is massive. If I look at the first two quarters, roughly $300 million negative free cash flow, but you're guiding for positive. Can you put -- for the full year. Can you put some numbers around that? Is that tens of millions or what's the right way to think about that? Thank you.","Devinder Kumar","I think, if you ask me, Q3 we expect free cash flow positive and free cash flow are positive for the year. It won't be tens of millions from a year standpoint. I think it's the pull digit, but I'm not going to give you a specific number.","Ambrish Srivastava","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.","Laura Graves","Thank you, operator. Two more questions, please.","Operator","Certainly. Our next question is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your line is now live.","Blayne Curtis","Hey, good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. Just curious on the notebook market and so talk about some pull-ins, but also short in the market, your ramping product. I was, wonder if you could parse those items out because notebook was pretty strong for you in June and I was just curious if that impact any seasonality into the end of the year?","Lisa Su","Sure, Blayne. From our standpoint, our notebook ramps were due to platform breath. We ramped a number of secondary Ryzen platforms as well as some new chrome platforms. I can't say that I can point to any particular pull-ins per se and I think we're still expecting that we see a seasonal uplift in the second half of the year.","Blayne Curtis","Thanks. And then maybe just a follow on to that. In your September guidance, if you are looking to win the Compute and Graphics segment, I'm wondering, between the three segments if you can just highlight, which one do you expect to be the strongest?","Lisa Su","So let's see, I think what I would say is that amongst the product lines and where they are in their ramp cycle, you would expect perhaps PCs to be the strongest and then graphics and server the next.","Blayne Curtis","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is now live.","Timothy Arcuri","Thanks a lot. Lisa, so my first question. I just wanted to ask, how you think about semi-custom sort of over the longer term? And talk maybe about cloud gaming and sort of how you think about its long-term effect on you? Because on one hand, you've done quite well with some of these big launches coming up, but you're also exposed to some potential cannibalization on the semi-custom side. So I'm wondering how you think about those two factors?","Lisa Su","Yeah. So look, I think we like sort of gaming overall. So if you think about gaming overall, there is PC gaming, there is cloud gaming and there is -- then there is console gaming. We believe a rich ecosystem is important. We want to have our Radeon graphics architecture across all those three segments. I've been asked about the cannibalization question.","I think it's too early to talk about that, maybe in a few years. I mean, we think cloud gaming is going to be important, but it's too early to say whether it's really a cannibalization thing or is it an additive, getting access to more users overall. So our goal is to make sure that our architecture is a very friendly to all segments of gaming.","Timothy Arcuri","Great, thanks. And then I just wanted to go back to the question that Ross just asked about, on the server share target. So it's not, that you are not reiterating that target here. It's more and you're going to update us on a target when you launch well. Is that the right way to think about it?","Lisa Su","No. Let me say it this way, I think, we do stand by the target. So the target being double digit sort of four to six quarters after the initial 5%. I think we feel good about that target. I'm not being more specific than that, until we get through more of the ramp.","Timothy Arcuri","Perfect. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. We reached end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.","Lisa Su","No, that was a good call. Thank you everyone for joining us for AMD second quarter call today. We look forward to speaking to you from San Francisco on August 7th and we appreciate your support of our Company. Thank you.","Operator","That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. We thank you for your participation today."],"455":["Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

If you have not reviewed these documents, they can be found on AMD's website at ir.amd.com. Participants on today's call our Dr. Lisa Su, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Devinder Kumar, our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. This is a live call and will be replayed via webcast on amd.com.","I would like to highlight a couple of important dates for you. Lisa Su will present at the Credit Suisse 21st Annual Technology Media and Telecom Conference on Tuesday, November 28, and our fourth quarter quiet time will begin at the close of business on Friday, December 15, 2017.","Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date, and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.","Additionally, please note that we will be referring to non-GAAP financials during this call, except for revenue and segment operational results, which are on a GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures referenced are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in the press release and CFO commentary posted on our website at quarterlyearnings.amd.com.

You'll also find detailed discussions about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC, and in particular, AMD's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 1, 2017.","With that, I will hand the call to Lisa. Lisa?","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. Q3 was a strong quarter for us, demonstrating the significant growth potential of AMD, driven by our strong high-performance products, leadership IP, and long-term strategy. Revenue increased 26% from a year ago to $1.64 billion. Gross margin also improved significantly year-over-year as we achieved profitability and generated positive free cash flow in the quarter.","Looking at our Computing and Graphics segment, we made excellent progress in the Q3, as the continued success of our Ryzen family of CPUs, combined with significant graphics growth, resulted in a 74% increase in Computing and Graphics segment revenue year-over-year. Client computing revenue increased by a strong double-digit percentage from a year ago, as we expanded our Ryzen processor family and saw increased demand in the desktop market. Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 processors have ramped well in the desktop channel market, reaching 40% to 50% desktop market share at strategic e-tailers worldwide. In addition, OEM adoption is accelerating as customers ramp shipments in advance of the holiday sales cycle.","In the quarter, we launched additional Ryzen CPUs, including Ryzen 3, expanding our reach in the mainstream and value market segments, Ryzen Threadripper processors, returning AMD to the high-end desktop market, and Ryzen PRO-based offerings, which have been adopted by all major commercial PC providers, including Dell, Lenovo, and HP, expanding our presence in the commercial space.","Also, in the quarter, we qualified and began early shipments of our Ryzen mobile processors combining our Zen CPU cores and Vega GPU cores in a high-performance APU designed to power ultra-thin and two-in-one notebooks. Acer, HP, and Lenovo plan to launch their initial Ryzen mobile-based systems in the coming weeks and we expect an expanded assortment of premium notebooks to launch in Q1 2018.","In graphics, we achieved record GPU revenue in the quarter based on significantly improved ASPs and higher unit shipments from a year ago. These financial improvements were driven by the launch of our Vega-based GPUs and had strong demand for Polaris products across both gaming and blockchain markets.","In the quarter, we expanded further into premium portions of the graphics market with new consumer and professional GPU solutions. Our Radeon RX Vega family of GPUs launched in the channel targeted at the enthusiast-class gaming segment. Revenue from initial shipments of these products is significantly outpacing previous premium Radeon GPUs.","Radeon Instinct MI25, our GPU compute solution, also began shipping in volume to mega-cloud datacenter customers. And Radeon Pro WX 9100 professional graphics cards, targeting the high-end professional content creation market, started shipping late in the quarter.","In addition, we saw expanded AMD Radeon adoption with cloud customers in the quarter, driven by our investments in GPU compute. Amazon Web Services announced that they have deployed AMD Radeon Pro technology to power Amazon AppStream 2.0, driving GPU-accelerated cloud delivery of virtual applications. We also announced a collaboration with Baidu to build more flexible and powerful AI computing platforms based on the deployment of our Radeon Instinct GPUs in their datacenters.","Turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, revenue was approximately flat year-over-year and increased 46% sequentially. Sequential growth was based on a seasonal increase in semi-custom revenue, as well as growth in server revenue from our EPYC datacenter processors. Our semi-custom business continues to perform as expected for the year and we anticipate seasonal demand to remain healthy as our customers enter the holiday sales cycle with Sony's PlayStation 4 Pro and Microsoft's Xbox One X.","In our server business, server revenue increased from a year ago as we began ramping sales of our EPYC datacenter processors to key cloud and OEM customers. Customer engagement with our EPYC processors is growing as the true performance and features of the platform are tested and implemented with Tencent and JD.com joining the list of datacenter customers planning to deploy EPYC processors.","In a short period, three of the super seven mega datacenter providers have publicly announced plans to deploy EPYC-based products into their hyperscale environments, including Baidu, Microsoft Azure and Tencent. And we have strong engagements with other major cloud providers. In addition, HP Enterprise and Dell are in the process of bringing their first EPYC-based platforms to market in Q4, and we are actively engaged with them to accelerate testing and validation of EPYC-based systems in datacenters across a broad number of large and medium enterprise customers.","We remain confident and focused on the steady expansion of our datacenter presence over the coming quarters based on the high-performance and rich feature set of the EPYC product. In addition, as a part of our ongoing strategy to monetize our differentiated IP, we successfully closed a patent licensing transaction in the quarter.","In closing, we are very pleased with our third quarter results. Throughout 2017, we have delivered significant year-on-year revenue growth and margin expansion as we achieved multiple major product, customer and market milestones. As we head into the final quarter of the year, we look forward to continuing to accelerate our business. 2017 annual revenue growth is now tracking above our previous estimates and we remain confident in our ability to make AMD one of the premier long-term growth companies in the tech industry.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our third quarter financial performance.","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon everyone. I am pleased with our performance for the third quarter of 2017. We increased revenue 26% year-over-year, expanded gross margin and achieved both operating and net income with net income of $110 million and diluted earnings of $0.10 per share. We are executing well with our strongest portfolio of products in many years including our Ryzen, EPYC and Radeon Vega offerings.","Let me provide some specifics for the third quarter. Revenue of $1.64 billion grew 26% year-over-year and 34% sequentially. This is our highest quarterly revenue since the fourth quarter of 2011. Year-over-year growth was primarily due to our Computing and Graphics segment, while sequential growth was driven by the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue seasonality, as well as higher Computing and Graphics segment revenue. We also took another step in our IP monetization efforts by closing a patent licensing agreement that had a positive impact on both our segments.","Gross margin was 35%, up 4 percentage points year-over-year, primarily driven by the benefit of IP-related revenue and a richer mix from the Computing and Graphics segment, which were partially offset by costs associated with our global foundries wafer supply agreement for wafers purchased at another foundry. We continue to make good progress on the ramp of our new high-performance products, which had a positive impact on our gross margins.","Operating expenses of $419 million compared to $353 million a year ago. The increase was primarily due to higher R&D-related investments and expenses related to annual employee incentive programs, driven by our better financial performance. Operating income was $155 million in the third quarter of 2017, a solid improvement on $70 million a year ago.","Third quarter net interest expense, taxes and other was $45 million, up slightly from $43 million a year ago. Lower interest expense from a year ago was largely offset by withholding taxes for licensing revenue.","Net income was $110 million or diluted earnings of $0.10 per share as compared to $27 million, or $0.03 per share a year ago. The diluted earnings per share calculation for the third quarter of 2017 was based on 1.143 million shares, which includes 100.6 million shares related to our 2026 convertible notes. Adjusted EBITDA was $191 million compared to $103 million a year ago.","Now turning to the business segments. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $890 million, up 74% year-over-year, primarily due to strong sales of our Radeon graphics and Ryzen desktop processors. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $70 million compared to a loss of $66 million a year ago. The solid improvement was primarily due to higher revenue.","Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $824 million, approximately flat year-over-year due to lower semi-custom SoC sales, partially offset by IP-related revenue. Additionally, server revenue increased from a year ago, driven by the increased sales of EPYC products. As you heard earlier from Lisa, customer interest and deployment plans are strong. Operating income was $84 million, down $52 million from $136 million a year ago, primarily due to higher costs.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities total $879 million at the end of the quarter, up from $844 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to higher revenue. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $794 million, down 5% from $833 million in the prior quarter.","Long-term debt on the balance sheet was $1.36 billion. Total principal debt, including our secured revolving line of credit, was $1.74 billion. In the third quarter, we used $28 million from our lower interest secured revolving line of credit to pay down long-term debt, which has a higher interest rate. Free cash flow was $32 million compared to $20 million in the year-ago period.","Before turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2017, which is a 13-week quarter, let me remind you, for comparative purposes, that the fourth quarter of 2016 was a 14-week quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2017, we expect revenue to decrease approximately 15% sequentially, plus or minus 3%. At the midpoint, this equates to revenue growth of approximately 26% year-over-year.","Non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 35%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $410 million, non-GAAP interest expense, taxes, and other to be approximately $30 million, and inventory to be down sequentially. We now expect 2017 annual revenue to increase by greater than 20% over 2016 compared to the prior guidance of mid to high-teens percentage growth. We do not anticipate significant changes to the diluted share count in the fourth quarter and you can find additional information regarding the share count in the CFO commentary, which is posted online.","In closing, the third quarter was a strong quarter and we are pleased with the momentum of our new premium products. We are making solid progress towards our growth and margin expansion objectives; and as our financial performance improves, we remain committed to investing in our multi-generational road maps and achieving our long-term financial targets.","With that, I'll turn it back to Laura for Q&A session. Laura?","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you, Devinder. Operator, we're ready for our first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question today is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking my question. For the first one, I was wondering if you could help quantify the benefit of your IP license in the two different segments, and is this a one-off? Or do you see ongoing benefits in Q4 and beyond?","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Sure, Vivek. Hey, thanks for the question. We did close a IP-related transaction. It was a patent licensing transaction. The revenue and benefit was spread over both segments. When we look at it going forward, we have a pipeline of IP deals and we're constantly looking at them. And from our standpoint, we're working several deals in progress. So we believe that IP-related revenue will be a factor as we go forward, but our primary focus is on the product-related revenue and the product-related growth.","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah, so, Vivek, just to remind you, in line \u2013 you've heard us talk about our IP monetization efforts, and this is very much in line with that. And as Lisa said, the benefit is spread over both the segments.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And then, for my follow-up, Lisa, when I look at your Q4 outlook, it's sort of in line with seasonality, perhaps somewhat better. Can you give us more color around the adoption of the new Ryzen mobile portfolio, but more importantly, your EPYC products, when will we start to see a more tangible contribution from your EPYC product sales? Thank you.","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah, absolutely, Vivek. So look, we are very pleased with how the revenue ramp is going in general on our new products. When you look at the Q4 guidance, year-over-year, we'll be up 26%. So we're really accelerating the business as we go into the second half of the year. As you know, our business is typically seasonal. And so Q3 is the peak and then we're down seasonally from Q3 to Q4 due to some of the semi-custom revenue. But what we see going into the fourth quarter is we see a strong ramp of new products. We see Ryzen continuing to ramp. We will ship volume of Ryzen mobile in Q4 and then more in the first half of the year. We will see a ramp of EPYC and we will also see an OEM ramp of Vega.","In terms of the headwinds, we have the semi-custom seasonality and we're also predicting that there will be some leveling-off of some of the cryptocurrency demand. As we look at it, it continues to be a factor, but we've seen restocking in the channels and stuff like that. So we're being a little bit conservative on the cryptocurrency side of the equation.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thank you.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question is coming from David Wong from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Can you give us some idea of whether you have any semi-custom wins that might bring in new revenue streams in 2018? Specifically, are you in any discussions with potential customers for semi-custom designs in autonomous driving or datacenter processor and accelerator applications?","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes, sure, David. So, look, the semi-custom business continues to be a business that's performing well for us. So we are \u2013 as we go into 2018, we are expanding the customer set beyond our traditional Sony and Microsoft game consoles. Actually, this past quarter, we announced that Atari will be adopting a customized processor for their next-generation. We also have a number of new opportunities that we continue to work. And they are in markets outside of game console, including some of the markets that you mentioned. So overall, we do expect there will be some puts and takes in the semi-custom business as we go into 2018 and there will be some new product revenue that will ramp particularly in the second half of 2018.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thanks.","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First one on the gross margin outlook for Q4, it looks like it's flattish versus Q3. And I guess, I might have expected the sequential increase given that you will likely have a better mix. So I'm hoping you can reconcile that. I'm wondering if licensing had an impact on that, or it's just fixed cost absorption?","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah. Let me start, Mark, and then maybe Devinder will add. So, look, we have multiple puts and takes in the business as we look at gross margin. When we look at gross margin in Q3, we were pleased with the gross margin progress, and yeah, that came from both the virtue of mix of our Computing and Graphics revenue year-over-year as well as some benefit from the IP-related transaction. As we go into Q4, we have new products continuing to ramp.","So you'll see Ryzen, Vega and EPYC ramp. And the primary driver for the Q4 gross margin is the product revenue. And we do have sort of the headwind of not having the benefit of the IP revenue in Q3. So those are the puts and takes. But the main point is the new product revenue is ramping and the gross margins are accretive. And that's contributing to our Q4 gross margin outlook.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Okay.","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Hi, Mark. If I can just add, if you look at the margin trend compared to 2016, 2016 we had 31% gross margin. And we expect to be at 34% this year. And that's primarily based on the strength of the new product that Lisa referenced. And from a long-term model standpoint, we are on track with what we laid out in the financial Analyst Day of going from 31% to 34%, and then expecting to be greater than 36% in 2018 on the strength of the new premium products that are ramping into 2018.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","That's helpful. Thank you. And a follow-up, if I may. On the EPYC server side, can you help us understand to what extent you're shipping to customers who are going through testing right now versus shipping into customers who are actually deploying EPYC in live datacenter applications. Thank you","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes, absolutely, Mark. So, look, we're pleased with how things are going with the EPYC ramp overall. So we have been shipping to both cloud as well as non-cloud customers in Q3 mostly early platform-type testing. In Q4, we expect to see some level of deployment again both in cloud and non-cloud applications. With the new platforms coming in from HP Enterprise and Dell, what we're saying is actually a ramp of new seating opportunities, particularly, in medium and large enterprise customers. So overall, the EPYC ramp is going well and we expect more deployments as we go into Q4 and into next year.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. Very helpful.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thanks, Mark. Operator, next question, please?","Operator","Certainly. Our next question is coming from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Please proceed with your question.","Kulin Patel - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. This is Kulin Patel, calling in for Ambrish. Thanks for taking my questions. You highlighted in your PR that you had a GM headwind related to buying wafers at another foundry. Do you expect any meaningful external purchases in Q4, or going forward in 2018 that could be a headwind to gross margins?","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","I think the way I look at that is if you look at Q3 from a volume standpoint and the volume is pretty high, and that's why it's highlighted from a viewpoint of the calls, but the way you want to look at it going forward Q4 and beyond is all of the costs related with the WSA that's referenced in the scripts is contemplated in our guidance and our long-term models.","Kulin Patel - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you. And I had a question on \u2013 you launched the Radeon Instinct MI25 maybe last quarter. Can you discuss the traction you're seeing in that product? Are you seeing any meaningful revenues in 3Q and in your 4Q outlook?","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes. So the Radeon Instinct MI25 is Vega for the cloud datacenters. We did actually start shipping volume in Q3 to multiple customers. We do see a very high interest in the product portfolio. And so we expect that to continue to ramp into Q4. And there's a lot of focus on increasing the software usability and the software flexibility. And so we continue to invest in those areas. But, overall, I'm actually very pleased with the interest in MI25 and it's coming from multiple customers in a number of markets.","Kulin Patel - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you. Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. I was interested in your comments that the sequential growth in the Computing and Graphics business was driven primarily by graphics. How literally should we take that? And I guess, if graphics is up close to $150 million sequentially, is that business now on par with the CPU business? Can you just give us a general sense of the size of the two businesses there in that segment?","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah. So overall, the growth in Computing and Graphics, when you look over the past few quarters has been very strong. And we've seen growth both on the Ryzen side, particularly in the desktop side of the business as well as on the graphics side. So in terms of size of the business, again, I think we stated in the prepared remarks that the GPU business had a record quarter for us and we're seeing very strong growth.","We're seeing strong growth as a result of the new product launches. So the Vega product actually did very well for us in the quarter as well as overall Polaris in both gaming and blockchain markets. But yes, we're pleased with the graphics performance. But I'll also say Ryzen did very well in the quarter. We look at the progress that we're making in the desktop channel when you look across retailers and e-tailers across the world. And in the Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 segment, we're seeing significant share gain in those parts of the business. So I think both parts of the Computing and Graphics business are doing well. And we continue to expect growth as we go forward.","Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And is it possible to size the blockchain portion of that?","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","I think the blockchain tends to be, again, it's hard to separate because it goes through some of the same channels as gaming does. I will say that blockchain sort of behaved as we expected in Q3. So we didn't see anything that we didn't expect. We did see some benefit of channel restocking. So if you look at our channel inventories today compared to July, we had healthier channel inventory levels. And we expect that consumer blockchain will level off a bit as we go into Q4. But there's also commercial blockchain component that we believe is interesting and likely to continue into the medium term. As we look into Q4, though, we also see growth from just the OEM side of the GPU business as we start ramping Vega into OEMs.","Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah. Good afternoon, Lisa. Apologize, I'm kind of juggling a couple calls like everyone else. I apologize if this is a repeat. But I'm just wondering, just given the qualitative success of Ryzen and the accretive ASPs and gross margins, I'm wondering if you could just help us understand on a more quantitative basis how much of your PC unit business is now Ryzen. And I guess, more importantly, how do we think about that progressing over the next several quarters? And kind of where is the tipping point where you think we'll start to see some significant leverage relative to the accretive ASPs and the accretive gross margins?","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah. Absolutely, John. So look, we are really pleased with how Ryzen is performing competitively in the market. It's fair to say though that we're still at the early stages of the Ryzen ramp. So primarily in Q2 and Q3, Ryzen has been a desktop channel phenomenon. So most of the sales have been in the desktop channel. We have started ramping OEMs in the desktop space. And we will continue ramping OEMs as we go into Q4. But it's nowhere near the majority of the client revenue.","You should expect that Ryzen will continue to ramp for us through the first half of next year, because we're adding more and more platforms as we speak, both on the consumer and also on the commercial front. And so we see again, it's ramping well. The ASPs are good. So actually, we saw some ASP increase in Ryzen as we went from Q2 to Q3, and we launched the high-end desktop version as well as Ryzen 3 and will continue to ramp into Q4 and first half of next year.","John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And then, Lisa, just as my follow-on, Kind of a similar question around EPYC, and just I know you guys have kind of talked about potentially exiting the end of next year at about a 2% share. I'm just kind of curious how you think about the ramp of EPYC. And if you can differentiate between sort of your hyperscale customers who might take it a little bit sooner versus the more traditional OEM channel, how should we be thinking about that on EPYC?","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah. So, John, I'm not sure we ever said 2% by the end of next year. But what I would say is that we expect EPYC to be a sizable portion of our revenue in 2018. So the second half this year, we're doing early pilots and we're doing some early deployments. The hyperscale guys are aggressive and they are first. We will start seeing some enterprise revenue here in Q4 as the early platforms launch. But I expect more of the enterprise to fill in as we go into 2018. And I think the important point is as we look at the product, as we look at the competition and where we're positioned, the product positioning is strong. And so the customer engagements are growing. And we're seeing significant interest from enterprise customers ramp now as some of the OEM platforms are becoming available and starting their seating. So overall, EPYC will continue to ramp into 2018 and should be a sizable \u2013 we expect it to be a sizable portion of our revenue in 2018.","John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks.","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for letting me ask the question. I wanted to go back to the mix of the business, and specifically, in the Computing and Graphics segment. The client ASPs were down sequentially and you highlighted that being because of mobile. Somewhat similar to John's question, Lisa, when do you expect to see the ASPs in that segment of your business start to turn to be a positive driver as opposed to a bit of a headwind?","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah. So definitely, desktop ASPs are up; mobile ASPs are down. I think we will see \u2013 again, there will be a initial ramp of Ryzen mobile in Q4, but I think in the first half of the year, you should see a significant amount of the volume that we ship into notebook be with Ryzen mobile. When I look at sort of the rate and pace of the ramp, I think it's going as we expect with desktop channels first, then desktop OEMs, and then commercial desktop, and then, say, consumer notebook starting in Q4 ramping into Q1. And then, we'll see commercial platforms in the first half of 2018 as well.","So I think there should be a steady ramp of ASPs as we go forward. We're also taking some opportunity, as you can imagine, to clean up some excess inventory as we transition to the new product. And so that's part of what we're doing to just ensure that we have a strong launch as we go into the new product portfolio. But overall, behaving as we expected, and in some sense, we're very pleased with how we're positioned competitively with the product.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And I guess, as my follow-up, switching to one for Devinder on the OpEx side of things, OpEx was a little higher in the third quarter, dropping sequentially into the fourth quarter. You've talked in the past about a 31% OpEx to revenue guide range for this year. You're probably not going to guide for 2018 with that much precision tonight. But is there any sort of puts and takes we can think of as far as how you guys are considering your investment philosophy as we move into 2018?","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","I think the first thing I'll say is we do want to invest in the business, especially with the growth opportunities we have and primarily targeting the OpEx investments towards R&D. They are, in the current moment, with a lot of products ramping, just in the last few months, you heard about the Ryzen ramp, you heard about EPYC, we talk about Vega, and obviously, their go-to-market cost will ramp up new products. But as far as 2017 guidance is concerned, I had said previously 31% as the potential of revenue, but I think right now, where the numbers are coming out especially with the strength on the revenue side of the equation, we think we end up at about 30% on an expense to revenue ratio in 2017, which, as you probably recall, is at the upper end of what we had said our long-term target model which is 26% to 30%.","So actually, I'm pretty pleased because if everything works out in the Q4 guidance that we gave, and in 2016 would have been a 32% of revenue; in 2017, approximately 30%; and then obviously, we'll see where we get into 2018. We're very pleased from a viewpoint of being able to make the investments in the business to support the product road map, the go-to-market cost for the ramp of new products, and at the same time, bring down the percentage of OpEx over revenue.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matt Ramsay from Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Lisa, I wanted to ask a little bit about the forward roadmap, particularly, in the processor group. I know that you guys have talked quite a bit about taking the roadmap down to 7-nanometer next year. And I think Mark gave some public comments about doing some stuff on 12-nanometer with GF. So I think it'd be helpful if you could talk to the extent that you can about some of the future road map and things that might be follow on to the products that are ramping currently. Thank you.","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah, absolutely, Matt. So 7-nanometer, we've talked about is a very important node for us and it's an important node for the industry. It's a major node. So we have a lot of engineering resources on that. And you should expect that that will be across all of our businesses. And we're actively working on those products now. We do see an opportunity with 12-nanometer. 12-nanometer is a relatively small engineering lift. And I would view it as a performance enhancement to our current road map.","And so we are working on taking some of our products, I would say, a subset of our products into 12-nanometer in 2018 to augment the performance of our client and graphics road map. But I see \u2013 the significant resources are on 7-nanometer, and that's progressing well. We're overall pleased with how the performance on that is looking. And then, we will opportunistically look at some products to go into 12-nanometer as it makes sense for the road map.","Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Got it. Thank you. And, Devinder, I wanted to press a little bit harder on the gross margin impacts of a few things that you called out. Particularly, is there any way that you can quantify for us at all the impact of the IP revenue on gross margin, either in the third quarter or comparatively into Q4? And second, I think a lot of us are aware of the forward charges you'll get for using wafers from other foundries. But I assume that that applies also to the gaming console business that comes out of TSMC currently. If you could clarify those two things that would be great. Thank you.","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah. I think if you look at it from an overall standpoint, if you look at the cost impact, it's all within our guidance. I think if you look at IP from that standpoint, we have several IP deals in the pipeline for Q3. Basically, we thought it was likely that we would be able to close on IP-related deal in the quarter, and that's how it turned out. And you see the benefit across both the segments. And from a go-forward standpoint, despite the cost of being there, we look at it overall from a viewpoint of the trend of the margin. Major provider of the gross margin uplift is the premium new products that we are launching. And then, obviously, there's opportunities from an IP standpoint to benefit the P&L if we go ahead and put that in the equation.","Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to better understand the December guidance a bit. Maybe if you could talk about it between the two segments. The embedded business last year was down 40%. It's been tracking down slightly year-over-year. So is that the right way to think about that segment this December? And then, maybe you can talk about on the graphics side, I just want to understand the commentary. You said that crypto or blockchain was kind of flattening out and that you were kind of getting some restocking. Just kind of understand when you look at growth in that segment, what are the moving pieces? Thanks.","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah. So, Blayne, let me answer that question. So overall, I think our business does have the seasonal pattern where the Q3 is the peak and we're down in Q4, primarily due to the semi-custom business. I believe those dynamics are the same. We've looked at sort of how the business will perform on a year-over-year basis. We believe that semi-custom revenue will be down a little bit on a year-over-year basis, and that's expected. We're in the fifth year of the cycle and you would expect that units to be down, although we have some positive mix because of the new launch of the Microsoft Xbox One X console, which is a higher ASP product for us.","When you look at the graphics business, again, overall, we see the business as quite strong. We see Vega ramping as we go into Q4. We see that from an OEM ramp standpoint. We see that from a GPU compute standpoint. And that's offset with a little bit of leveling-off of the blockchain demand. But overall, I think we see sort of Computing and Graphics continuing to grow as we go into Q4.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. And then, just maybe a second question, following up on some of the questions on process node. You had high reuse with the server product this time. How do you think about the R&D cost in terms of if you were doing a core at TSMC versus doing one at GloFlo, a dual track, as you look into 2018, how should you think about the OpEx required to do that?","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah. So it's part of our engineering model. So we've sort of engineered a model where we can use our IP at multiple foundries. And that will continue as we go into 7-nanometer. So if you look at this year, we have multiple products in 16-nanometer and 14-nanometer. As we go into 2018 and beyond, it's the same thing. So there are no additional costs related to our dual sourcing strategy.","I think from an overall R&D standpoint, as Devinder said, we will look to ramp our spending in line with revenue. And primarily it's around continuing to invest in our new market opportunities, continuing to invest on the GPU side and what we're doing in the compute markets, continuing to strengthen our sales and marketing as we go to market with these broad new products. But there's no particular OpEx impact of using multiple foundries.","Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thanks, Lisa.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Hans Mosesmann from Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Hans Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Hey, Lisa, can you give us in terms of timing 7-nanometer for next year and what products would be the focus initially for that node?","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Sure, Hans. So I'm not going to comment directly on timing of products because obviously there's a lot of R&D yet to be done. But I would say that our product portfolio in general will take advantage of 7-nanometer. So you should expect our server portfolio, our graphics portfolio and our client portfolio to all take advantage of 7-nanometer at some point in time. And we like the performance as well as the power and the density shrink that we get from it. And so again, we think it will really help to improve our competitive positioning as we move forward.","Hans Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.","All right. And then as a follow-up, if you can answer this and maybe it was already answered so forgive me. On the IP front in Q3, did you indicate what end market or what type of application or what geographic location the IP relationship is all about?","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah. So we did say that the IP transaction was a patent licensing related transaction. So that's different from the technology licensing, for example, that we did with THATIC. This was a straight patent licensing. And the great thing about our patent portfolio is beyond sort of our core markets, it has applicability across a broad range of markets. And so this was a patent transaction and not a technology licensing transaction.","Hans Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. Very helpful. Thank you.","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thanks, Hans.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.","Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Yeah. Hi, Lisa. So I was just wondering on the datacenter side, when you look at \u2013 you mentioned EPYC was strong. I was wondering if you can break out how much revenue came out of the datacenter sector from EPYC, and how it grew sequentially and have you see it going into the December quarter as well?","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Okay. Yeah. You broke up a little bit there, Vijay, but I think I got the question. So the question was sort of the strength of EPYC and where do we see it going in Q4. Look, I think EPYC had a good quarter. Obviously it's growing off of a small base since we had a small base for the server revenue, but we certainly saw growth in unit shipments and revenue into Q3. We will see more growth or we expect to see more growth into Q4, especially as some of these trial runs turn into more deployment activity. And as more OEMs ramp our platforms, the platforms will be more available in the industry. And we're seeing growing interest from a number of enterprise customers as well. But we should think about EPYC as a long-term growth driver. So yes, we will see growth into Q4, but it will be a sizable portion of our revenue as we go into 2018.","Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Got it. And do you see \u2013 and then you would start breaking out that enterprise, datacenter out of semi-custom like your peers are doing (45:55-46:04).","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","I think the question was whether we would begin breaking out enterprise separately as a segment, and I don't know that we've made any decisions to do that. And then the second question was very hard to hear, Vijay. We'll ask you to repeat it, please.","Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Yeah. Just channel inventory in GPUs. How do you see channel inventory on the GPU side?","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes. Okay. So for your first question, I think as Laura said, we haven't made any determinations about different segment reporting. But we will give you markers on how the business is growing. And I think it will be clear just given the accretive nature of EPYC, as we start ramping that product, you'll see more impact of the product-related revenue. The second question is as it relates to channel inventory in graphics. I believe that channel inventory is healthier in graphics here in October than it was in July. We've certainly restocked some of the channel both for Polaris as well as the Vega products. I would still say that channel inventory might be a little bit light. It's not fully restocked yet, but it's certainly healthier than it was in the July timeframe.","Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Great. Thanks a lot. Very helpful.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you. Operator, we have time for two more questions, please.","Operator","Certainly. Our next question is coming from Chris Danely from Citigroup. Your line is now live.","Wayne Loeb - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hello. This is Wayne Loeb for Chris Danely. Thank you for taking my question. Can I ask you how you feel you did share-wise in CPU and GPU in Q3?","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes. So we will have to wait until obviously the share results come in. I think when we look at the CPU side of the business, we feel really good about how Ryzen is doing in the desktop channel. So we think we definitely made progress there. As you look overall, we'd have to see how the overall results come in. And on the GPU side, again, we ship a significant volume that was a record quarter for us and we saw strength across our new products as well as our current products and we saw significant ASP growth, which is important for us. But, again, I would wait until the overall results come out in a few weeks.","Wayne Loeb - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. Could you also give your view on the overall PC industry? Was it better? Worse? The same? As expected?","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","I think \u2013 that's a good question. I think the overall PC industry is about what we expected. Maybe a tad bit better. But I would say about what we expected. We see good geographical sort of \u2013 the geographies are doing well particularly North America and Europe. There's a little bit of softness in China particularly at the low-end of the market. And I think there's some change in dynamics in China. But, overall, I think the PC market was about what is expected and that's a good thing.","Wayne Loeb - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you, Wayne.","Operator","Thank you.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Operator?","Operator","Certainly. Our final question today is coming from Tristan Gerra from Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. You've announced some design-wins for EPYC. Have you seen the number of design-wins increase in the quarter? And is what you have enough to reach that longer-term target of 10% market share? Or do you need to line up more design-wins to get there?","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah. That's a very good question. So we have seen design-wins and customer engagements increase in the quarter. We've seen customers who started with one platform now looking at multiple platforms with EPYC. And then, in terms of design-win coverage, we believe we have design-win and platform coverage to meet or exceed our share goal targets. So it's not a design win statement. It's really a conversion of design-wins to revenue as we help our customers ramp in the coming quarters. So very happy with the customer progress; very happy with the number of platforms that we have and we continue to expand those platforms in the customer base over time.","Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then, my quick follow-up will be how do you see the opportunities of selling EPYC and Vega in \u2013 notably in enterprise platforms? Is that a setting factor to customers value this as a system solution versus just one architecture?","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes. We have seen a good interest from both OEMs as well as end customers on looking at EPYC and\/or MI25 product together. We actually have a working machine, the P47 petaflop machine that we announced at SIGGRAPH. And we have actually a number of customers using that to trial their software and their application. And so, yes, I do think it's a selling point. I do believe that customers do want some integrated system solutions, but as we always say, the products operate very well standalone and they work with other products as well, but we will continue to work on those system-level solutions for customers.","Operator","Thank you.

Lisa?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you, Laura; and good afternoon to all those listening in today. We ended the first half of 2018 strong delivering our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth, driven by increased demand for our high-performance products. Second quarter revenue of $1.76 billion grew 53% year-over-year and gross margin improved more than three percentage points, resulting in our highest quarterly net income in seven years.","We are very pleased with the year-over-year financial performance across both of our business segments. As we continue to gain share, driven by strong customer adoption of our new products in the PC, gaming and data center markets.","Looking at our Computing and Graphics segment, second quarter CG segment revenue increased 64% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for our Radeon GPUs and a significant ramp of our Ryzen mobile processors. Ryzen unit shipments grew strong double-digit sequentially as Ryzen mobile processor shipments more than doubled in the quarter. Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Huawei, Lenovo and Samsung launched dozens of Ryzen processor-based notebooks, which position us well to continue growing Ryzen mobile sales, heading into the back-to-school and holiday seasons.","In the commercial PC market, we launched our Ryzen PRO commercial mobile APUs in the quarter. For the first time in our history, all three major commercial OEMs, Dell, HP and Lenovo now offer enterprise class notebooks and desktops, powered by AMD. And we are seeing strong initial interest as customers evaluate these new systems.","Continuing our strong roadmap execution, we launched our second generation Ryzen desktop CPU to very positive reviews in April, just 13 months after the first Ryzen desktop processors were released. Additionally, in June, we delivered the first public demonstration of our second generation AMD Ryzen Threadripper processors, with the industry's first 32 core PC processor designed for the high-end desktop market. We are on track to launch our second generation Threadripper processor in August with leadership performance for the enthusiast and content creation markets.","Overall, we are very pleased with the market adoption of our Ryzen processors. 44 consumer and commercial Ryzen-based desktops and notebooks have been launched this year, and our customers remain on track to bring a total of 60 Ryzen-based systems to market in 2018. In Graphics, strong channel and data center demand drove significant year-over-year increases in revenue and ASPs. Sequentially, Graphics revenue was down primarily driven by lower blockchain-related sales, partially offset by stronger data center sales.","Sales into the high-end enthusiast and performance portions of the gaming market grew substantially year-over-year based on the adoption of our latest Radeon RX 500 and Vega series GPUs.","We continue to execute our software strategy to provide the best gaming experience in the industry, with new AMD Radeon GPU drivers published for every major game launched in the quarter and expanded partnerships with Ubisoft, Capcom and Rebellion to optimize their next generation of games on Radeon graphics.","On the hardware side, we continue to expand the adoption of our Radeon Vega architecture with the introduction of new OEM systems and AIB cards in smaller and more mobile form factors. Samsung also announced they added our FreeSync technology to many of their high-end TVs, giving PC and console gamers the ultimate big screen gaming experience. The AMD FreeSync ecosystem is the broadest in the industry with more than 400 FreeSync-enabled monitors and TVs in market to-date.","Data center GPU revenue increased significantly in the quarter, driven by Vega-based Radeon Instinct MI25 shipments. Our GPU engagements with large cloud customers continued to expand as we increased our investments in hardware and open software solutions in this important space.","At Computex this year, we showed the first public demonstration of our next generation 7-nanometer Radeon Vega GPU, which includes new features optimized for the artificial intelligence and machine learning markets. We started sampling of this product in the second quarter and we are on track to launch this next generation product, the world's first 7-nanometer GPU later this year.","Turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, second quarter segment revenue increased 37% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong Semi-Custom sales and growing adoption of our EPYC data center processors.","Starting with our Server business, we celebrated our one-year anniversary of the launch of our EPYC server processors with an increase of greater than 50% in both revenue and unit shipments sequentially.","We have over 50 customer platforms now in market, including Cisco who announced their highest density server offering ever, powered by EPYC processors and HP Enterprise who launched their first EPYC-based single socket ProLiant server, which delivers significantly lower costs per virtual machine than the leading dual-socket competitor.","We also saw strong progress with our mega data center partners as Tencent Cloud announced immediate availability of their SA1 Cloud Service, delivering 30% lower costs per VM with outstanding performance across key workloads.","Shipments for mega data center customers more than doubled in the quarter, as we made significant progress towards qualification of production instances at multiple cloud providers in anticipation of deployments planned in the second half of this year. We're also seeing momentum from Tier 2 next wave cloud service providers that have the ability to ramp quickly with the noted preference for the value and capability that our EPYC single socket offering brings.","Turning to large enterprise customers, we added dozens of new end customers in the quarter. Our value proposition continues to be strong in segments like HPC, data analytics and in general-purpose virtualized enterprise environments. We are extremely focused on accelerating EPYC processor adoption in these targeted segments in the second half of the year.","Finally, I'm very pleased with our execution against our long-term roadmap. We received first silicon of our next generation 7-nanometer EPYC processor with Zen 2, code-named Rome, in the second quarter. And the silicon quality and bring-up has gone very well. I am happy to report that we've recently started sampling Rome to select partners for early validation and we are on track to launch in 2019, strengthening our already outstanding competitive position in the market. We remain focused on our near-term milestone of achieving mid-single digit server unit share by the end of 2018 on the path to our midterm goal of double digit market share.","Moving on to our Semi-Custom and Embedded businesses, Semi-Custom revenue increased year-over-year and sequentially in support of Sony and Microsoft game consoles. We are proud that Microsoft and Sony have collectively shipped well over 100 million AMD-powered game consoles in the current cycle. The game console market continues to be an important segment for us in the long term, and we are well-positioned based on our strong partnerships and differentiated IP and design capabilities.","Embedded sales increased by double digit percentage year-over-year, driven by growth across the embedded gaming, industrial and medical imaging markets. We also saw strong initial design wins for our new EPYC and Ryzen-embedded product families following their launch last quarter.","In closing, we are very pleased with our second quarter financial results. We delivered strong revenue growth and margin expansion as demand for our new high-performance products continued to accelerate. Most importantly, we believe our long-term technology bets position us very well for the future. Several years ago, we made important decisions around our CPU and GPU roadmaps to drive leadership at the 7-nanometer node. We now have line of sight to those products coming to market and we see incredible opportunities ahead based on the competitive positioning and customer interest in our upcoming 7-nanometer products.","We are confident that with continued execution, we are on an excellent trajectory to drive market share gains and growth in revenue and profitability. We are focused on that continued execution as we make significant investments in our hardware and software roadmaps to deliver even more compelling products to our customers in the 2019 and 2020 timeframe.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our second quarter financial performance. Devinder?","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you, Lisa; and good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was another strong quarter for AMD. Year-over-year, we grew revenue 53% and expanded gross margins to 37%, while significantly growing operating margin and earnings per share. Quarterly revenue of $1.76 billion was higher year-over-year, driven by strength across all product lines.","Gross margin was up 360 basis points year-over-year, driven by the ramp of new products. Operating expenses were $467 million or 27% of revenue, down as a percentage of revenue from 34% a year ago. We are delivering operating leverage while launching new products and making strategic R&D investment to support our multi-generational product roadmaps. R&D investments in the first half of 2018 increased 25% as compared to the first half of 2017 in support of our future product roadmaps. Operating income grew from $186 million from $23 million a year ago. Operating margin was 11% and both our business segments reported double-digit operating margin percentage.","Adjusted EBITDA was $228 million, compared to $58 million a year ago, and on a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted EBITDA has grown considerably to $666 million, resulting in gross debt leverage of 2.5 times. Net income was $156 million, a significant improvement compared to a loss of $7 million one year ago. This is our highest quarterly net income since 2011. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.14, using a diluted share count of 1,147 million compared to a loss of $0.01 per share a year ago.","Now turning to the business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $1.1 billion, up 64% year-over-year, led by strong sales of both Radeon and Ryzen products. Ryzen products accounted for approximately 60% of client revenue and we saw particular strength in Ryzen mobile processors in the second quarter as new notebook products continued to ramp.","Strong channel and data center demand drove year-over-year Graphics revenue increases. Sequentially Graphics revenue was down primarily driven by lower blockchain sales partially offset by stronger data center sales. We believe blockchain-related revenue declined from approximately 10% of our revenue in the first quarter to approximately 6% of our overall revenue in the second quarter.","Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $117 million or 11% of segment revenue compared to operating income of $7 million one year ago. The significant increase was due to strong revenue growth coupled with improved operating expense leverage. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $670 million, up 37% year-over-year, driven primarily by Semi-Custom and EPYC processor sales. These results include higher-than-anticipated Semi-Custom revenue in Q2 due to higher inventory with non-cancelable purchase orders in accordance with ASC 606. EPYC processor units and revenue grew greater than 50% quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by mega data center sales.","EESC operating income was $69 million, or 10% of segment revenue, up from an operating income of $16 million a year ago on higher revenue. Q2 2017 operating income for EESC also included a licensing gain of $25 million.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $983 million at the end of quarter. Free cash flow was negative $88 million in the second quarter due to working capital requirements in support of recent revenue growth. Inventory was $750 million, up slightly from the prior quarter. Total principal debt, including our secured revolving line of credit, was $1.7 billion.","Now turning to our financial outlook. For the third quarter 2018, AMD expects revenue to be approximately $1.7 billion, plus or minus $50 million. This would be an increase of approximately 7% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher sales of Ryzen and EPYC products, partially offset by lower sales of GPU products in the blockchain market. Sequentially, this would be a decrease of approximately 3% with higher Ryzen and EPYC processor revenue offset by lower GPU revenue. In addition, we now expect Semi-Custom revenue to be lower sequentially in Q3 following higher-than-expected Q2 revenue.","As a reminder, for comparative purposes, Q3 2017 revenue was $1.58 billion, adjusted for ASC 606 revenue accounting standard. In addition, for Q3, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 38%, up from 36% in the prior year, driven by the ramp of Ryzen and EPYC product sales; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $470 million, or 28% of revenue; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $35 million; and free cash flow to be positive. For the full-year 2018, we continue to expect revenue growth of mid-20s-percent, gross margin in excess of 37% and to be free cash flow positive.","In closing, Q2 was an excellent quarter and 2018 is expected to be a solid year. I am pleased with our business execution and financial results, driven by the strength of our high-performance products portfolio. We remain focused on executing our long-term financial model for revenue growth, margin expansion and improved profitability.","Now with that, I'll turn it back to Laura for the question-and-answer session. Laura?","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you, Devinder. Operator, we're ready for our first question here in the room.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Lisa, for you, on the \u2013 it seems Intel seems to have pushed their 10-nanometer volume ramp-out into 2019. And I think a lot of people view your foundry 7-nanometer kind of the same ZIP Code as their 10-nanometers. So, I'm wondering if you could give us some context and\/or color on what does this mean? If you're at parity with Intel, have you \u2013 has AMD ever been at parity before with Intel? And does that change the conversation with your customers in terms of their interest in your products? Thank you.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah, Mark. Thanks for the question. So, look, in terms of our roadmaps, both on the CPU and GPU side, we made some important technology decisions a couple of years ago. And we bet heavily on 7-nanometer. We thought 7-nanometer would be a big node for the industry and it would be important for us to be early in the adoption of 7-nanometer. So when you look at where we are today, especially on the CPU side, we have first silicon of our Rome product; it looks very good. We also have a good number of architectural improvements and enhancements in Zen 2 that will come with 7-nanometer technology.","So we're very pleased with where we are and where the competitive positioning is. And I would say, to your question about how is it perceived? I think customers are very interested in where we are. Clearly, we have to execute. But with our current generation, Naples customers have certainly gotten to understand our architecture. With the improvements that we have going into 7-nanometer with Rome, I think, there is enhanced interest, and from a competitive positioning standpoint, we do believe we have an excellent competitive position going into 2019. So we are very excited about that.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. A follow-up, if I may. As we look at the double-digit bogey for next year on servers, is that \u2013 do you need EPYC 2 to get to that? And what are the risks on bringing that to market? Thank you.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah, so, Mark, we view the double-digit share goal as an important share goal. I think it certainly will come with the second generation of EPYC, so the Zen 2 product. But I view it as a journey, right? We have now sort of three generations that we have. We have Zen 1 that's in the market today. We have Zen 2 that's well into the productization phase, and then we have a very strong roadmap around Zen 3 as well. So we feel good about our competitive position and the path to double digit market share. I think this is all about rate and pace, and we're working very, very closely with our customers to accelerate that ramp.","And actually, I was very pleased. I mentioned in the prepared remarks earlier that in the second quarter, we saw some nice acceleration of the mega data center customers. So we saw units there more than double, and that's an indication that we're getting the right level of engagement and progress with our large customers.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Very helpful. Thank you.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah, Lisa, Devinder. Congratulations on the strong results. Lisa, I wonder if you could just give us a little bit more detail into the foundry strategy at 7-nanometers, and kind of how much flexibility do you have between your two foundry partners. And to what extent if one of them is having trouble on 7-nanometer, does the wafer supply agreement give you the ability to move capacity without having to pay for wafers?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah, sure, John. So a couple of years ago, we did amend the wafer supply agreement. It was a very strategic agreement for us as we look over the long term. So at 7-nanometer, we are engaged with both TSMC and GLOBALFOUNDRIES. I would say that we do have, on a product-by-product basis, the choice between the foundries and we make those decisions on a product-by-product basis. But in terms of our long-term roadmap and how we feel about it both on the GPU and CPU side, the main message is we don't believe process technology is going to be a gate for us. We have a lot of architectural work, a lot of architectural improvements, but we don't believe process technology is a gate for our roadmap.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And then, Lisa, as my second question, can you help me better understand? Because one of the things I know you've been working on aggressively with the launch of EPYC 2 is your ability to cover a broader swath of workloads, and just increase the server TAM you can go after. So can you help quantify to me as you go from EPYC 1 to EPYC 2 what that growth in workload coverage looks like? And, importantly, as you continue to broaden out, how do we think about the R&D burden from here?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah, sure, John. So when we go from the first generation of EPYC to the second generation of EPYC, I do think that there are some improvements that we'll make in the architecture that will expand the TAM. But from a TAM standpoint, we are not limited. I view our coverage today as 80% of the TAM. And, yes, some workloads are really clean kills and other workloads are closer, but we are servicing a large portion of the TAM. I think the value proposition increases with some of the architectural improvements that we've made in the second generation of EPYC. But from the standpoint of TAM, I think we feel good about it.","From an R&D standpoint and Devinder made the comment in our prepared remarks that we did increase R&D by 25% year-on-year. But I think we've done it in a very responsible way. So we have revenue growth. We're seeing margin expansion, which is a very, very key piece of our business model. And then, we will increase R&D and go-to-market resources effectively. But I don't believe that we will ever increase our OpEx ahead of revenue. I think it's a balance between each of those lines.","So we have these \u2013 I think we have a strong roadmap at this point and we'll look for opportunities to increase R&D, particularly on the software side, actually. I think we have a lot of opportunity on the software side across CPUs and GPUs to accelerate some of our machine learning work. And so that's where incremental R&D would go.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And then, if I could sneak one last one in, Lisa, just on the GPU side, I think this is the second or third quarter in a row that you've highlighted incremental gains inside of the data center. Can you help size what that represents as a percent of revenue today? And, I guess, more importantly as you bring to market the 7-nanometer GPU part, how are you thinking about exploiting that in the data center and the TAM expectations, or revenue expectations we should have over the next four quarters to eight quarters?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah, so on the GPU side, there's no question that the demand for GPUs in the data center are growing very quickly, even faster than on the CPU side for sure. And our data center engagements, our focus on the GPU side is very cloud-centric. So large customers, places where our GPU capability can be well-targeted. I would say, the size of the business is still small, so we are growing, but it is still small. But there's lots of interest in our current generation MI25 and there's even more interest in our 7-nanometer Vega GPU that's coming to market later this year.","So we expect an opportunity to grow that segment over the next four quarters to eight quarters. And as you can see in the market, overall, the GPU segment is growing quite a bit in data centers. And so we'll continue to invest heavily in this area.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Appreciate it. Thank you.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thanks, John.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Next question, please, operator?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to just start with the clarification and then I have a follow-up. What's the assumption for blockchain revenue in Q3 and for the full year? And just if you have an updated view of overall 2018 sales growth?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah, sure, Vivek. So let me take that, and then Devinder can add if necessary. So for Q2, we were approximately 6% of revenue for blockchain. For Q3, we're planning very little blockchain. So we expected it to be down in the second half, but we're planning very little in Q3. So if you update that on a full-year basis for 2018 blockchain will be lower than what we had previously discussed in the last earnings call. So I would say previously we said mid- to high-single-digits. I think this would more on the mid-single-side. And we'll continue to watch the market develop over the next couple of quarters.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. And then, Lisa, have you seen any competitive response from Intel so far in either PCs or servers. For example, some of your desktop parts saw some ASP decline. Was it just mix or price competition? Or anything else that we should keep in mind?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah, sure, Vivek. So let me take each of the segments separately. So if you look at the PC segment, what we have seen is basically a ramping of our product portfolio. Certainly in desktop, we had some mix here in the second quarter where we increased the percentage of the APUs that were being sold into the desktop channel segment. And so you saw a little bit of a mix to a bit softer desktop ASPs. But overall, when I look overall, I would say that the competitive situation is about what I would expect. There is product competition and we see that.","We do ensure that there is good transition of products. So when we moved from our first generation Ryzen to our second generation Ryzen, we had some channel programs to make sure that we managed channel inventory on the first generation. But we've seen nothing that I would call unusual.","On the notebook side, actually, I'm pretty please because we're really seeing the notebook side of the business pick up. And so mobile ASPs were up, the percentage of Ryzen units in mobile were up and we see that continuing into the second half of the year.","And then on the EPYC side, again, I would say that the competition is really product-based. And for us, there are some workload optimization that we do with customers. But I haven't seen anything that's unusual relative to the pricing environment. And, in fact, as EPYC ramps, our ASPs are going up.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. And one last quick one, if I may. When should we expect to see the breakout quarter for EPYC, Lisa? Will that be Q3, Q4, what's the visibility around that?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","I think we are very focused on ensuring we deliver that mid-single-digit unit share at the end of 2018. I think as we go into the second half of the year, I would still see it as fourth quarter would be a real important quarter for us. I think we'll see ramps into third quarter. And the key is as you know with some of these cloud partners, it's actually important when they actually ramp these larger instances. And so lots of visibility into work being done and the exact timing will depend on our customers' ramps.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew D. Ramsay - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Thank you. Lisa, a couple of questions on the server business and then I'll follow up on a couple of PC things. In server, you guys have laid out the mid-singles unit share number by the end of this year. And maybe you could walk us through that with a little bit of granularity, like how do you balance what seems to be really high demand within the cloud customer base for Rome versus pushing volumes in the near term of Naples? And I think some folks have asked a couple of questions around process node, and you're obviously sampling already with Rome. So maybe could be explicit about where you're manufacturing that? Thank you.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah, sure. So a couple of different questions here, Matt. On the EPYC, your question is Naples versus Rome and how we manage that. Look, our focus from a sales and go-to-market standpoint right now is on Naples. First generation EPYC, we have a lot of platforms in market, over 50 platforms in market. There are a lot of customers that have systems in their labs, going through various stages of qualification, and we're very focused on supporting that and ensuring that we see that ramp into the second half of the year.","Rome is really a 2019 story. I think the good part about it is I expect that customers perhaps took a little bit longer in their initial qualification and work around Naples. And our hope is that as we go into Rome, you see those qualification timelines tighten up a little bit. But no question that for 2018, it's a Naples story, and there's a lot of customer interest around Rome. And we will manage that. But we want to make sure that we also do as much of the validation work on our side before we sample too broadly. I think the good news is there's a lot of interest, and it's really just on us to execute cleanly through the next couple of quarters.","And Matt, you had some other questions? Or...","Matthew D. Ramsay - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah. The last there on server was about manufacturing for Rome. And then, just talk about one thing on the PC side, particularly notebooks, one of the questions I'm getting most often from investors is as the product portfolio from AMD improves dramatically, and I think well, again, as you guys go to 7-nanometer, it seems like winning sell-in share with OEMs is something that you guys have a bit of control of.","But I wanted ask a little bit about sell-through and consumer adoption and mind share around your client products. Intel has wound down some of the Intel Inside marketing program, and I know maybe you have some opportunities there. Maybe you could talk about some of the steps that their marketing team is making to maybe change and refresh some of the consumer perception of the products relative to how quickly they've improved fundamentally? Thank you.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes. Absolutely. So, Matt, on your first question relative to the manufacturing of the second generation of EPYC, so as I said earlier, we are working with both the TSMC and GLOBALFOUNDRIES in 7-nanometer. As for the 7-nanometer Rome that we're currently sampling, that's being manufactured at TSMC. And then your second question about where we are in the PSPC market, sell-in versus sell-out share, actually it's a great question. It's a great question. And when I look at the PC market, we have great relationships with the OEMs.","You can see it from the number of platforms that we have out there. But there's no question that there's opportunity for us to get the consumer perception and the commercial enterprise perception up. And so we've been very focused on that. And that comes with additional investment in go-to-market expenses.","So getting the Ryzen brand out there, getting the Radeon brand out there, it includes additional training at some key retailers to ensure that they know how to sell Ryzen and they know what the value proposition is. And what we see is some clear signs of early momentum in sell-out. So as our platforms launched here in the month of June, we actually saw quite a few of the outlets that they actually sold out of our product. And we've had to restock that here quickly.","And as we go into the second half of the year, I think you'll see in both back-to-school and in holiday globally that we have a larger presence of assortment than we have had in the past. So that's a clear focus for us in the PC market.","Matthew D. Ramsay - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thanks, Matt.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Bernstein Research","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I wanted ask about Ryzen share. I thought I heard you say that Ryzen was 60% of your CPU revenues in the quarter. I thought that's what you said it was last quarter as well. So how do I reconcile that with the other color around the sequential growth of Ryzen into Q2?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah, so, Stacy, it was approximately 60%. And when you look at it on a quarter-on-quarter basis, we had more units overall in desktop and notebook. Particularly, in notebook, we saw an acceleration of Ryzen mobile units in the notebook. So it's an approximate number, it's not an exact number, but it's approximately 60%. We also saw some legacy business increase, and that's why you see that.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Bernstein Research","Okay. So basically, it was maybe like a little below 60% before and like a little above 60% now but kind of around 60%?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","In that range, exactly.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Bernstein Research","Okay. For my second question, you said you had EPYC up more than 50% sequentially. So I think it doubled last quarter; it's up 50% this quarter. But is there any \u2013 I think you're still running, call it, 1%, maybe a little \u2013 kind of in that ballpark of share. So if you're going to get 5% exiting the year, you got to probably triple or more the current run rate by Q4. And I know you had mentioned earlier that Q4 was going to be a kind of like an important quarter. Is that the kind of, I guess, ramp rate or run rate you're actually thinking about this EPYC business into the back half of the year in order to meet your targets?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes, Stacy. I think we view an acceleration as we go into the second half of the year, particularly as some of these guys go into larger production. But yes, there are significant number more units. I think we just see a pipeline that can accomplish that.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Bernstein Research","Got it. Just one quick housekeeping. Just why did the accounts receivable go up so much?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Devinder?","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","I didn't get the question, Stacy?","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Bernstein Research","I'm sorry. Accounts receivable and why did they go up so much.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Accounts receivable.","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah, it went up \u2013 primarily it's higher revenue and timing of collections, so that's the main reason. In addition, there was an increase in this, associated with unbilled AR for Semi-Custom revenue which, as you know, is recognized under ASC 606. Those parts have not shipped, but they get recognized as revenue. And that sits as unbilled AR under the AR line.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Bernstein Research","Got it. Thank you, guys.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thanks, Stacy.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. Wondering if you could talk a little bit about the Chinese JV and the product that's being developed there that you've licensed. Can you talk about when you expect to see that product emerge? And how do you think about that sort of AMD proper competing with the JV within those Chinese customers? Are you agnostic to who wins, or just how should we think about that?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Sure, Joe. So we did start this Chinese JV a couple of years ago, and the whole idea was to get more share in the domestic China market. The partnership has gone well. The product development is going well. We view the product as complementary to our current portfolio. So I think from that standpoint, we will continue to sell AMD EPYC into the China market. And then, for certain domestic China applications, I think the China JV product will be available. They have not yet announced the exact timing of that. So I'll wait until the official announcement of it. But so far, it's gone as expected. And I think the product development has gone quite well.","Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you, Joe. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Hans Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Lisa, a couple of questions. The timing of the Ryzen version of 7-nanometer after EPYC, when will that happen in 2019? Is that the quarter after or six months? Just the timing. And then the second question is how many of the mega data center guys are you actually engaged with at the moment? Thanks.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah, okay. So, Hans, on the timing of the 7-nanometer Ryzen, I would just keep it as it's after the 7-nanometer EPYC. So we'll launch 7-nanometer EPYC first. I wouldn't say, it's very far out, but I would say it's after. And then, in terms of mega data centers, we are engaged with all of them in some way, shape or form across CPU and GPU. On the CPU standpoint, I would say, we are heavily engaged with five.","Hans Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin Edward Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Question. Just again, on EPYC, you were very clear that it was going to be about four quarters in qualification before your customers would start deployment. With EPYC 2, are there any programs in place? Or can we expect that it'd be a shorter amount of time before that could be deployed?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes, Kevin. So I believe \u2013 and, of course, we'll have to see how this plays out. But I think with EPYC, there were some customers who waited for us to completely qualify before they started, let's call it, their own evals and that's to be understood because we were returning to the market. I think with the second generation of EPYC, one would expect that there would be some customers who would do, let's call it, parallel qualifications with our own qualifications.","And so I think there is an opportunity to overlap some of that work and certainly that's part of the reason that we've started early sampling as early as we have to try to parallelize some of that activity.","Kevin Edward Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. And on the GPU traction you're getting in the data center, is there a high attach rate with your EPYC processors? Or is that just an independent traction?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","I would say, at the moment for 2018-type revenue, they are independent engagements at the moment. I think as we move into the 7-nanometer node with both EPYC and our Vega 7-nanometer, there will be more of an attach rate and there is more interest, frankly, in that attach.","Kevin Edward Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah, thanks for taking the question. How should we think about OpEx growth over the next several quarters? It seems like you've been growing OpEx in the 20%-plus range. Should that moderate going forward? Or should we expect that to stay relatively stable?","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","I think the first thing is if you look at our model that we've laid out, we've set the long-term target model to stay within the range of 26% to 30%. This year, with the revenue guide that we've given in the mid-20s, we are guiding to about 28% OpEx to revenue. Year-over-year basis, you're right, we have increased it and largely those increases have been in R&D.","If you look on the first half of 2017 to the first half of 2018, OpEx is up, but is largely weighted towards the R&D side. We are pleased with the operating leverage that we are getting from a company standpoint with the increase in revenue, but at the same time targeted investments vary heavily in the product roadmaps. And some of the things that you heard Lisa just talked about from the products and all of the multiple levers that we have to increase revenue, we are definitely investing in those areas.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. And as a follow-up, Lisa, it's been a little bit over a year since you laid out your long-term financial model. I realize crypto has been sort of a tailwind since then. But is it fair to say that you guys are on track to hit the $0.75 and above EPS number, ex-crypto?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes. I think, Tosh, if you look at the long-term financial model and put aside temporal things, we feel that we are on track towards that long-term financial model. In some places, we are ahead. In some places, we are on track. But, overall, I think we feel good about where we are towards the long-term financial model.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Wayne Loeb - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hello. This is Wayne Loeb for Chris Danely. Thank you for taking my call. What kind of performance improvement will 7-nanometer EPYC have over the current one?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah, Wayne, I think we're not yet getting into details of what the performance improvement is of the 7-nanometer EPYC. So I think we'll have more details on the architecture and where we are in performance later this year.","Wayne Loeb - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. As a follow-up, you talked about your goal of mid-single-digit share for EPYC by the end of the year. Exiting the year, what do you think your share would be in desktops and notebooks?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","I think we'll continue to make progress in desktops and notebooks. In particular, I think, we expect that the notebook share will increase as we go into the second half of the year. Obviously, the PC market overall is doing a little bit better than most people expected. And so we'll have to see how the market does. But from our standpoint, we don't have a specific share target out there for end of this year. We believe we'll continue to gain share based on what we see in design wins at this point.","Wayne Loeb - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thanks, Wayne.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Thank you very much, Lisa. I had a \u2013 and I'm sorry if you addressed it earlier on the call. What is the timing for the 7-nanometer GPU? And then my related question on GPU is could you just update us on what's the progress on the software ecosystem? Specifically, in competition with the moat, seemingly huge moat than NVIDIA has built with CUDA. Thank you.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Sure, Ambrish. So our 7-nanometer GPU started sampling here in the second quarter and we will launch it later this year. So it will launch \u2013 we expect it to launch in 2018.","As it relates to the software ecosystem, we're making good progress. We're making incremental progress each quarter. And the important thing and the reason \u2013 our strategy right now in GPUs in the data center is to engage with large cloud guys who have the ability to work with us, and in some sense we're focusing our software efforts on their needs first. And that allows us to do this vertical by vertical. So I think we're making good progress. It's a multi-year effort and we are very clear that it's a multiyear effort. But we have seen some initial positive momentum and we're going to continue to invest in this space. So it's the number one investment priority for us.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So in data center, Lisa, sorry, just a quick follow-up. What areas have you been able to gain traction within the \u2013 and it's a pretty large area within machine learning, where specifically have you been able to let yourself in? Thank you.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes, again, we're working with several cloud vendors on key applications in their data center.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thanks, Ambrish. Operator, we have time for two more questions, please.","Operator","No problem. Our next question comes from line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Aaron Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. Thank you for taking questions, also congratulations on the quarter. I apologize to continue to go back to EPYC. But just curious as we think about the ramp, you've mentioned that you have over 50 platforms now in the market. I'm just curious if you were asked to characterize how many of those were shipping in volume, and what your expectation would be through the course of the remainder of this year in terms of those turning into true meaningful volumes?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah. So I'm thinking about that. I would say, a number of those platforms, a large majority of those platforms are shipping to multiple customers. So volume, of course, is all relative. And the way we count platforms are obviously platforms from the OEMs as well as platforms from ODMs and a number of the cloud guys are doing their own platforms, more specific platforms.","So I would say, a large number of those, the majority of those would have our shipping to multiple customers, and production sort of the scale of the production is what is customer-dependent. So some of them are in hundreds of units, some of them are in thousands of units, some of them are in tens of thousands of units and different scales of numbers.","Aaron Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Fair enough. And then, as a quick follow-up. As we think about the ramp of some of your new platforms going forward, and we tie that to your long-term gross margin target of \u2013 I think it was 40% to 44%, can you just remind us again of how we can think about the mix in terms of the margin profile of some of the new businesses ramping? And how quickly maybe we should consider that 40%-plus targeted gross margin?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Well, we're guiding the third quarter to 38% gross margin. That's largely on the strength of new product portfolio. I think what we said before, and which still holds is our Ryzen, our EPYC, our Radeon data center products are all in aggregate over 50% from a gross margin standpoint. So they're well above the corporate average. I think we're starting to see the mix and that margin accretion of the new products. And so we'll continue to do that over the next couple of quarters.","Aaron Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So I guess, it's fair to assume...","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Did that answer your question?","Aaron Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah, I guess, I'm just trying to \u2013 I guess, given the commentary around the fourth quarter and EPYC really that being an important quarter, could we assume that gross margin from here continues to trend higher?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Well, I think it's fair to say that as we go into the second half of the year, our new products will be a larger percentage of our overall product revenue. And that is positive from a margin standpoint.","Aaron Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our final question comes from line of Tim Arcuri with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. I had two. I guess, when I look at the stock, there is no \u2013 I'm not sure there's a lot of data about the share gain targets this year. But maybe there is some question about the ability to sustain those targets next year and the year after. So I guess, the question \u2013 first question is what are you doing differently this time that was not done in the Opteron cycle? Are you giving your customers more visibility to your roadmap? Thank you.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Tim, I think the major thing that we're doing differently as a company and certainly around EPYC is we are doing what we said we were going to do. We laid out a five-year roadmap for what we wanted to do in servers. We told them what first-generation EPYC would look like. It came out a little bit better than they expected.","We told them when to expect second generation EPYC and what we were trying to do that. And I'm really pleased to say that we are exactly on track to what we said we were going to do. And we have a third-generation behind that. So our focus is to execute really, really well and provide customers a differentiation in the value proposition to consider us as a long-term partner. We are not after what happens over the next two quarters. This is extraordinarily \u2013 it's a journey for us with EPYC. And I think we feel good about what we've done. And the entire team is focused on delivering what we said we were going to do.","Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC","Got it, Lisa. Thank you for that. And then, I guess just the last question is really around the strategic foundry roadmap beyond 7-nanometer. Clearly, you have a lead now that because Intel is going to really I think functionally skip over 10-nanometer, which is great, and maybe it's a little bit unexpected given when you began development of these parts. But how do you think strategically beyond 7-nanometer as you move to 5-nanometer with your partner? And where Intel will be at that time? Thank you.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","What we see in the foundry roadmap is actually a very nice cadence of technologies. So we do believe 7-nanometer will be a large node. There will be derivatives of 7-nanometer, 7-nanometer, 7-nanometer plus. We have seen the first view of 5-nanometer, and we think 5-nanometer is very competitive as well. So again, our goal is to use the best the process technology can offer in the foundry market, and then differentiate on architecture, and product positioning, and those kinds of things.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you very much, Tim.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back to Laura Graves for closing remarks.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you, operator, and everyone who joined our call today for the Q&A, thank you very much.

My name is Huey, and I'll be your conference operator for today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to AMD's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. ","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Ruth Cotter, Vice President of Investor Relations for AMD. Please go ahead.","Ruth Cotter","Thank you, and welcome to AMD's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. By now, you should have had the opportunity to review a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary. If you've not reviewed these documents, they can be found on AMD's website at quarterlyearnings.amd.com.","The participants on our call today are Rory Read, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Thomas Seifert, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of AMD. This is a live call and it will be replayed via webcast on amd.com. The replay will be available for the next 10 days starting later this evening.","Before we begin today, I'd like to highlight a few dates of interest for you. Mark Papermaster, our Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, will present at the Jefferies Global Media and Telecom Conference on May 7 in New York. Thomas Seifert will present at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Technology Conference in San Francisco on the 8th of May.

Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date, and as such, includes risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. You'll also find detailed discussions about such risk factors in our filings with the SEC, and in particular, AMD's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. Finally, any non-GAAP financial measures or references on this call are reconciled in the CFO-written commentary posted on our website.","Now with that, I'd like to hand the call over to Rory. Rory?","Rory P. Read","Thank you, Ruth. Q1 was a solid quarter for AMD. We made good progress improving our execution, becoming more consistent and building trust with our customers and partners. We have taken steps to position the company to seize the opportunities in front of us, both in the high-growth markets and in the product categories, where our innovative technology provides us with leadership opportunities.","Our improved execution resulted in better-than-expected revenue of $1.59 billion for the seasonally down first quarter, a 6% sequential decrease and a 2% decrease year-over-year. First quarter non-GAAP income was $92 million. This is a 64% improvement from the year-ago period, which was driven by gross margin improvements resulting from a richer product mix and operational efficiencies.","A steady supply of 32-nanometer products allowed us to meet our customer commitment in the quarter. Consistent execution that builds trust with our customers remains the fundamental part of our near-term growth strategy. We are also pleased with our 28-nanometer graphics product ramp. We met our new product introduction commitments in the quarter and we are now the only company offering a top-to-bottom family of 28-nanometer discrete desktop GPU offerings. Customer demand for these industry-leading graphic products is strong.","Adoption of our APUs continues to accelerate. APUs account for nearly 100% of our mobile unit shipments in the quarter, helping drive an approximate 30% increase in mobile processor unit shipments and significant mobile revenue growth from a year ago.","We saw a strong success in the critical 400 to 700 mainstream retail notebook price band, which accounts for nearly 50% of all notebooks sold in retail in 2011. For example, the best-selling premium notebook SKU of the first quarter at Best Buy was in fact powered by our AMD AA APU.","Our next-generation Trinity APU for mainstream notebook extends our leadership opportunity in this large and growing price band. Trinity improves on virtually every aspect of our current A-Series APUs while doubling the performance per watt. By integrating a discrete level GPU into the die, Trinity enables outstanding video and gaming experiences with superior battery life. Trinity is a great value, excelling at running the types of software increasingly used by our consumers buying these mainstream notebooks. We are successfully ramping production of Trinity APUs as customers prepared to launch a record number of AMD notebook designs beginning this quarter. ","Our momentum with Brazos continued in the quarter as well, helping drive a double-digit percentage increase in emerging market revenue from the period one year ago. Brazos delivers an unmatched value proposition and experience for consumers in these emerging markets.","The introduction of Brazos 2.0 this quarter builds on the momentum. Thanks to many new features and improved performance and extended battery life, we have made it easy for customers to take advantage of these advancements by simplifying platform transitions and reducing their time to market. Trinity and Brazos 2.0 systems will be available globally this quarter and we expect broad availability for the key back-to-school period.","Our Server business continues to make steady progress. We achieved our third consecutive quarter of server processor unit shipment growth, driven by increased adoption of our Bulldozer-based offerings. For the first time, Bulldozer processors accounted for more than 50% of server revenue and unit shipments in the quarter. We are strengthening our server customer relationships, refining our capabilities and methodically laying the foundation required to build long-term growth and leadership. We are fully committed to build this business step-by-step over the long term. ","We accelerated our disruptive server strategy in the quarter with the acquisition of SeaMicro. This acquisition positioned AMD to take the leadership position in the fast-growing cloud data center market and sets the stage for AMD to provide unmatched low-power, high-bandwidth server solution that expands our market opportunity. This is an exciting area of the business that I look forward to discussing more in future calls.","In Graphics, solid demand for our next-generation AMD Radeon 7000 graphic cards, particularly in the channel, grew sequential GPU revenue increases. We are focused on growing the profitability of our Graphics business by attacking and winning more channel business. We will introduce our first 28-nanometer notebook discrete graphics chips this quarter. And we expect to quickly transition the majority of our product mix to these industry-leading products.","So in summary, we're excited about the opportunities in front of us. And we know we have the right ingredients to win and grow. First, we're refreshing our entire portfolio of APO offerings, strengthening our growth opportunity in high-volume segments and fast-growing markets. Next, we have amended our Wafer Supply Agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES to create a win-win business arrangement. We are also seeing continuous improvement in 32-nanometer yields, helping ensure we have the right products to meet customer demands. And then, step-by-step, we're becoming a more consistent execution engine. We're building more trust with our customers and partners and having a greater opportunity to win more of their business.","We're seeing results with our efforts. For example, with the strong adoption of our Trinity APU for ultrathin notebooks. Customers are excited that Trinity fits into virtually any ultrathin design, providing unmatched visual experience, superior battery life at a very attractive mainstream price point. Trinity-based ultrathins provide superior performance and value for all customers, not just a small portion of the market buying expensive, premium notebooks.","We have a number of high-volume, ultrathin design wins across our customer base, setting the stage for continued growth as mainstream notebooks continue their transition to these thinner and lighter designs that will dominate the market in the years to come.","With that, I'll turn it over to Thomas, who will cover our financials for the first quarter.","Thomas Seifert","Thank you, Rory. Revenue for the first quarter of 2012 was $1.59 billion, down 6% sequentially driven by the seasonal decline in the Computing Solutions segment. The Graphics segment revenue was sequentially flat in a typically down quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 46%, flat sequentially and a point higher than expected. The delta to guidance is a result of higher-than-anticipated demand for certain 32-nanometer line of products, particularly in emerging markets.","Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was calculated net of the $703 million one-time charge related to the 28-nanometer product, limited wafer of exclusivity from GLOBALFOUNDRIES, associated with the 2012 amendment to the Wafer Supply Agreement. Operating expenses were $598 million, which includes $6 million in one-time expenses related to the SeaMicro acquisition. R&D was $368 million, 23% of net revenue, and SG&A was $230 million, 15% of net revenue.","Non-GAAP net income was $92 million and non-GAAP operating income was $138 million. Interest expense was $43 million, flat compared to the prior quarter. Tax provision was a net credit of $32 million in the quarter compared to $4 million in the prior quarter. The difference is primarily a one-time tax benefit of $36 million related to the SeaMicro acquisition, which closed at the end of the quarter. Net of this one-time tax benefit, 2012 tax guidance is approximately $12 million.","Non-GAAP EPS was $0.12, calculated using 748 million fully diluted shares. Adjusted EBITDA was $250 million, down $45 million from the prior quarter due to lower non-GAAP operating income resulting from lower revenue in the quarter. ","Computing Solutions segment revenue was $1.2 billion, down 8% sequentially, driven by seasonally lower sales in the client business. Client product revenue declined sequentially due to lower units and ASP, primarily driven by lower 45-nanometer desktop processor unit shipments. ","APUs continue to increase as a percentage of our client products and Llano, our first-generation 32-nanometer APU, power top-selling notebook SKUs in North America, priced about $400. Our server processor revenue declined from the prior quarter, mainly due to ASP decline. And unit shipments increased with continued adoption of Bulldozer-based offering.","Chipset revenue declined in the quarter due to seasonally lower unit shipments. Computing Solutions' operating income was $124 million, down $41 million sequentially, primarily due to lower revenue. Graphics segment revenue was $382 million, flat compared to the prior quarter. GPU revenue was up in a seasonally down quarter due to improved desktop GPU ASPs in the channel, offset by seasonally lower game console royalty revenue. Graphics segment operating income was $34 million, up $7 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to higher gross margin.","Now turning to the balance sheet. Our performance was strong as cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including long-term securities, ended the quarter at $1.71 billion. Cash declined by $201 million compared to the end of the previous quarter, which was primarily the result of cash payments of $281 million related to the SeaMicro acquisition and $150 million related to the 2012 amendments to the Wafer Supply Agreement.","Despite strategic cash outlays in the quarter, we maintained positive free cash flow of $67 million. Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter was $962 million, up $43 million compared to the end of the fourth quarter of 2011 due to the timing of sales. Inventory was $585 million, exiting the quarter, up $109 million from the prior quarter, primarily in preparation for new product launches. Debt at the end of the quarter was unchanged at $2.02 billion.","Now turning to the outlook. AMD expects revenue to increase 3% sequentially, plus or minus 3%. Operating expenses are expected to be approximately $605 million in the second quarter as we continue to fine-tune our operational efficiencies, executing to all financial targets. We are pleased we delivered solid results in the quarter with a richer product mix. We expect to build on this financial and operational momentum moving forward and look forward to the upcoming launches of Trinity and Brazos 2.0 later this quarter.","With that, I'll turn it back to Ruth.","Ruth Cotter","Thank you. Operator, we'd now like you to poll the audience for some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first questioner in queue is Uche Orji with UBS.","Next questioner in queue is Sanjay Chaurasia with Nomura.","Sanjay Chaurasia - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","This is Sanjay Chaurasia. My first question is on 28-nanometer. Some of the industry participants have talked about capacity issues in 28-nanometer. My question is, are you seeing any impact to your Graphics business from this? And what are you seeing go ahead in 28-nanometer?","Rory P. Read","28-nanometer has been -- is a very important part of our business. As you may know, we're the first company that has launched our entire desktop discrete graphics product set on 28-nanometer. And I can tell you that within the first quarter, we were able to deliver on all of our customer commitments in that Graphics segment. What we're doing is we're monitoring this closely. We believe that a focus on execution consistently, day in and day out, will yield better returns and better execution. We think that, from our perspective, that we have the execution in place, the relationships with our key foundry partners to deliver on our 28-nanometer product ramp. Of course, we're going to monitor it. We're going to track it week in and week out to make sure. And we do hear some of the information in the quarter. We believe that we can deliver our base plan and our commitments to the customers. Right now, we're looking to the ability to reach upside. That's what's probably holding us back on the 28-nanometer going forward. But again, we're focused on going after that and we have the execution and plans in place, Sanjay.","Thomas Seifert","Let me put some color on that, too. As you heard from Rory, we met all of our customer commitments in the first quarter. When demand is strong and your product is good, this opens up opportunity for upside. And that is an area where we would like to see more velocity, to be very honest, and that's why we have to monitor the situation very carefully. We meet commitments, we are limited on upside, and that is not a good situation when your product is good and demand is strong.","Sanjay Chaurasia - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And my follow-up is on server ASPs. So given that 50% of server revenue came from newly -- recently launched Bulldozer chips, how is it that server ASPs are down? And now that these products are just before the launch of Ivy Bridge products, what trends can we expect on ASPs on your PC client business and as well as on server?","Rory P. Read","Yes, from a standpoint of server, again, as we mentioned in the earlier remarks, server has shown 3 consecutive quarters of solid, improving momentum and execution. Now we believe with Bulldozer now reaching over 50% of the revenue and unit shipments, we're positioned to continue to build on that execution and momentum. It is about building a business over a long term. And we believe that step-by-step, we can create that business momentum and continue to build on that server. In terms of the ASP, we see some impact in terms of the mix and certain deals that were there. But we continue to believe that we'll build on that mix and continue to move forward from there. Also, you may reflect on that with the acquisition of SeaMicro, it uniquely positions us to continue to participate and build on the server momentum in the fast-growing mega data center segment around dense computing. And we're very excited to bring on this solution into our portfolio of products. From a client perspective, our ASP models in terms of matching our customer demand are consistent. We like to build on that moving each quarter out. And from the perspective our partners and customers are very excited about the APU solutions, whether it was Brazos and Llano. And now with the launch of Trinity and then Brazos 2.0, with an unprecedented number of design wins, I think we're uniquely positioned to continue to build on that and move further up the price band stock with our APU offerings with the new Trinity offering. Which again, based on what we're seeing, is better at basically every key dimension and 2x the performance per watt.","Operator","Our next questioner in queue is Uche Orji with UBS.","Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Rory, can I just ask you how the OEM are perceiving your ability to compete in the ultrathin market. Obviously, Trinity seems to be ramping well. But my perception here is that with Intel having done a lot of the heavy lifting in ultrabooks, some of them may be hesitant to use somebody else on the ultrathin form factor. Is that a concern at all? Or are there other ways that you are going about, making sure that you get a fair share of that market as it ramps to the second half?","Rory P. Read","Sure, Uche. Well, it's very nice to speak to you and I'm glad you were able to get back on. Around ultrathin, with the new Trinity launch and the record number of design wins we've been able to capture, I think this is an exciting time for AMD. With the introduction of Trinity and our ability to reach just about any thickness in ultrathin design that our customers have designed, I think, again, we're positioned very well to take advantage of this continued movement to thin and light. Trinity has outstanding battery life. It has the ability for us to introduce it into this very thin, ultrathin form factor. And what's powerful about this, Uche, and how you need to think about it, ultrathins are not just for the few in the premium high-priced segment. We need to look at the ability to bring ultrathins and high mobility to all customers, to bring it into mainstream. What's exciting about the design wins that we're seeing and the continued momentum around ultrathins, around AMD, is around our ability to reach mainstream price points to open this up to everyone. And that's an opportunity where I think we can play off some of this initial energy and buzz that's all kind of crowded at this very high price band. But with a set of AMD offerings with our key partners, I think they're very interested in entering into this mainstream segment. And I think it uniquely positions us in the second half to participate in a very powerful way as we move forward. I like how we're set up in this segment. That's where the volume is. That's where the business is. And that's where our designs are being won. And that's what we believe will be some high-runner, high-volume part wins and we're excited about it.","Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","One for Thomas. Thomas, first of all, real quick, how should we think about Q2 gross margins given the non-GAAP 46% you achieved in Q1, above what we were all expecting. What does that mean for Q2? And with all these new products you're ramping, will that be -- should we expect that -- the trajectory to start to move higher from here? And related to that also, I know you've made some positive comments about your traction in servers. Can you just update us where the market share situation is in servers being focused, because obviously that has implications for gross margins.","Thomas Seifert","Yes. Let me start with the gross margin question first. So without any doubt, we have made good progress on the yield side on 32-nanometer. We entered the quarter with a lot of momentum and we saw some benefits in terms of product mix earlier than we expected. We expected some of those benefits in the second quarter and that's allowed us to come, gross-margin wise in the first quarter, a little bit higher than expected. So moving into the second quarter, what are the headwinds and the tailwinds? We expect to continue to build on our yield improvement on 32-nanometer, we expect to build on the momentum we see on the product mix side. And we will see some headwinds from quite a significant number of 28-nanometer products that are going to start to ramp in the second quarter. So if you put all the gives and the takes together, we will see the benefit continue that we see in the first quarter, and we expect gross margin to be slightly up -- flat to slightly up in the second quarter.","Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And servers, maybe Rory can take that. I mean, from the progress you've seen so far, you gained share in servers the last quarter. The reviews were great on your new Interlagos, it's very encouraging. But has that issue on the market share continued, and if you have any sense as to where you think we will be able to see in 2012 in terms of market share?","Rory P. Read","Yes, Uche. Server is obviously a key business for us, a business that we want to consistently build over the long term. We're in this space for the long haul. We're going to build this business over a quarter-by-quarter execution focus. We're working to build out our capabilities and our go to market, our support from the ecosystem and the technology that we can bring to market. I think we've made some good initial progress here in terms of momentum that we're creating in server but this is a step-by-step and long-term set of initiatives. We have plenty of work to continue to do around execution, and around server, and we're going to be intensely focused on that. The key to winning in server is to create the solution that allows the customer to get a better experience in terms of price performance, performance per watt, floorspace usage, and we really play very well in terms of virtualization, and I think this positions us well going forward. So again, I think good initial progress, Uche. I think we'll continue to build on that. We clearly want to keep that momentum going and adding server share quarter in and quarter out. But this is a long-term strategy, one that we're in it for the long haul. And we're going to build on that strategy. That's why we went after SeaMicro. And we believe with SeaMicro, it positions us to capture that high-growth dense server play. You could think about that fabric and what that's going to do in that server segment, where we're going to weave 16 and 32 servers in a fabric that creates a dense solution that dramatically lowers power consumption, floorspace, all the components that matter to these big cloud server structures. We believe we've gained share and we believe that with the continued focus, a continued build out of our capability, this quarter, next quarter and well into the future, we can continue to build out that model.","Operator","Next questioner in queue is John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","Patrick Walsh","This is Patrick Walsh calling in for John Pitzer. I just had a question on the inventories. There was kind of a pretty big uptick there, and I was wondering if you can kind of speak to -- just maybe give us some color as to what happened there.","Thomas Seifert","Yes. You heard Rory talk in his part about the product launches we expect. We have a complete top to bottom refresh of our APUs with Trinity and Brazos 2.0. And at the same time, we are going to launch all the new graphic 28-nanometer mobile graphic products for the mobile segment. So in preparation of the launches of all those products, we position product, we position inventory and inventory build is based around the product launches for those products.","Patrick Walsh","And then I guess my follow-up question is on the OpEx line. You guys have kind of been running a little bit below the $610 million trend that you guys laid out. Would you expect to stay below $610 million in the second half? Or do you think you're going to kind of make up I guess the $15 million to $20 million that you've done there in the first half?","Thomas Seifert","Yes, so very good question. We said already at our Analyst Day that we expect the operating expenses to be somewhat back-end loaded. So we expect them to pick up in the second half. It has a lot to do with getting ready for a significant amount of work and launches around 28-nanometer products. Tape outs around the launches getting ready for 2013 is going to happen that year. So flattened -- flatter in the first half, first and second quarter, and you will see a pickup in the second half. But we still expect to stay for the year within the range that we gave.","Operator","Our next questioner in queue is Glen Yeung with Citigroup.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Thomas, you printed now a quarter in Q1 where you have 46% gross margin, it sounds like you'll likely do the same for Q2. How should we think about then the full year gross margin guidance of 44% to 48%? Do you now feel more confident in the upper half of that? Or are there things in the back half of the year that we should think about that might hurt gross margin?","Thomas Seifert","Good question. So I think the trend that we see in Q2 will continue for the remainder of the year. We continue to expect to make progress on the year front. We continue to expect to make progress on the product mix. And we will see, in the second half, however, also some more headwinds with 28-nanometer products going in production at GLOBALFOUNDRIES. That those have control impact in the second half. Despite of that, I think we're on a good trajectory within the guidance that we gave at Analyst Day, 44% to 48%, and we expect to move to the high end of that range over the course of the year as we said at the Analyst Day.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And my follow-up is thinking slightly longer term about AMD and thinking about opportunities for processors outside of the PC environment. I know there's going to be some focus on things like tablets. But I'm actually interested in what the potential is that you see in the gaming market, not just for Graphics but also for compute devices.","Rory P. Read","I think this, Glen, is a very interesting segment in terms of the embedded opportunities for us. This is an important business already for us. And I think there's continued opportunity as we introduce the next family of core solutions around Trinity and Brazos 2.0. We've seen very strong interest in terms of the embedded market. We'll continue to build that out in '13 as we introduce the next family of those sets of products. Whether that's in thin client or around gaming or any of the verticals, there's a lot of interest in this capability of the APU combining a compute complex with the Graphics complex that allows the processing and the power of the solution to be brought to bear at a very attractive valuable price-performance scenario. So I think we're going to see some increased focus from us in terms of our embedded business and to really leverage the infrastructure and capability we've created.","Operator","Next questioner in queue is Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","First, I'm curious to see -- to learn what you're seeing in terms of hard drives. Do you see any sort of impact at all in Q1 from any sort of impact from hard drive shortages? And is there any sort of lift to your Q2 guidance maybe from the end of a potential hard drive destocking? And do you see maybe potential for a recovery in hard drives as giving a boost to what might typically be considered seasonality to your CPU top line as you move through the rest of the year?","Rory P. Read","Yes. Thanks, Stacy. Good question. From a hard file perspective, we've not -- as we've talked about before, we -- this is a very, a resilient supply chain in the PC industry. Having been in it for a long time, I've seen many part situations come and go, and this is no different. Once we got past the January time frame, the hard file situation is pretty much gone, past, everybody in the industry. We saw no significant impact in terms of hard file to our business results in 1Q. And with the only issue being some residual higher pricing that's floating around in the market around files, I don't think there's a significant impact into 2Q and 3Q. I think this is fundamentally behind the industry and should be able to move forward. In terms of it having impact, and a lift going forward, I think we've already seen that strong capability in both February and March, we've been able to really catch up on that business and position to move forward from there.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And if I can ask one follow-up. So you mentioned lower 45-nanometer desktop sales. I know last quarter -- or 2 quarters ago, you've been impacted as you were moving that capacity over to 32. And then last quarter, you were impacted because you had a process excursion, I would assume, as you were moving it back. Lower sales now, is this because you're still -- there's still an issue with the process or is this just more evidence of OEMs moving off from 45 and under 32? And if, on that line, if you could give us some feeling for how much your 32-nanometer shipments actually increased quarter-over-quarter that'd be really helpful.","Rory P. Read","Yes. From a standpoint of desktop, there's no doubt those earlier issues kind of held that back. We are intensely focused on increasing our ability to deliver and really recapture that share in desktop. This is important for our business and important to go forward. I don't really see, from a desktop perspective, any significant issues. We've just got to deliver the 45 processor load and the 32. We've got to ramp that up as now supply positions are dramatically better. In terms of trade off between 32 and 45, 45 still clings well in the market. 32 is beginning to ramp up now that you've got the supply situation behind us. We are focused on this. You could talk to any of our business unit leader, this is an item that we have to continue to focus on and make progress. I'm not seeing anything from an execution standpoint that should hold us back. We need to deliver on this capability and put us in the position to go forward.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And so last quarter, you said Llano was up like 80%. What were your 32-nanometer shipments up this quarter in that environment?","Thomas Seifert","We are not going to comment but it was up significantly. We're stopping giving concrete guidance here. I think it's important for you to understand that the progress is significant and we are not any longer supply limited on that note.","Operator","Next questioner in queue is JoAnne Feeney with Longbow Research.","JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC","I have a question about how your customers are handling the transition from Llano to Trinity and Brazos, the original versions of Brazos 2.0. Are you seeing, any of them, a pause in their purchases and are you instead sending perhaps some of those exiting inventories out to emerging markets and channel customers rather than the OEMs? Can you give us [indiscernible] transition and if there's a lull in the second quarter here because of that?","Rory P. Read","Okay, no problem. Thanks, Joanne for the question. From the standpoint of emerging market, I do want to reference the emerging market. In the quarter, we've definitely seen continued microprocessor revenue growth, up about 21% year-over-year. And clearly, the Brazos APU has done very well in emerging market and Llano has followed that up. As we begun to launch Trinity, there's been a real interest in Trinity. We shipped Trinity. We're making all of the ramp figures that we've made, commitments to our customer and there's strong interest for both OEMs, in terms of their -- across all OEM in that segment. And then with Brazos 2.0, of course, they're looking for the increased performance, the increased capability that we're introducing into that segment. They like that segment. Brazos has done well. Brazos 2.0, with that additional, has strong interest from the OEMs. So I'm not seeing that, JoAnne, in terms of any pause or concern. Right now, the channel we're focused on, 45-nanometer product and minus one. We're also focused on building up the Llano because 32 is now under control and the execution and the yields are performing very well out of GLOBALFOUNDRIES. And then what we've got to do is now launch this record number of designs with Trinity and then Brazos 2.0 in the quarter. OEM interest has never been stronger and we look to continue to build on that.","JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC","So as a follow-up there's been a lot of discussion about how, perhaps, these ultrathin builds will wait towards later in the year when Windows 8 is available. Can you give us a hint as to the trajectory, perhaps, for the Trinity and Brazos ramp into your ultrathin design wins?","Rory P. Read","Well, we've already run a substantial number of design wins in that space. And as I continue to meet with OEM customers, our large global accounts, there's more and more continued interest around that. You're going to see that continue to go into the second half. And that's very important. As I mentioned earlier, JoAnne, I really think that the current ultrathins that are being kind of grouped in this very high price band in a very crowded way is going to kind of cause a problem. If we think about it and we go where we have gone and attack with our customers, is to say, \"Let's go after mainstream. Let's bring this to everyone.\" People are going to want this solution at a great price. We think we can kind of fly right under that pricing umbrella and really attack it with this Trinity launch with some high-volume runners.","JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC","So it sounds like you think that the price advantage on the AMD APUs is bigger than the implicit price advantage being built out by Intel through these marketing dollars supporting the Ultrabook launch. Is that a fair way to think about this?","Rory P. Read","From my perspective, because of the way we're constructing the solutions with these large global accounts and the way we're using this superior APU kind of architecture that gives an outstanding experience, we can hit that ultrathin form factor and then total bill on material puts us in a very interesting price point that allows us to get into that upper mainstream segment. I think that opens it up for some really interesting discussions on what's the better play here.","Operator","Next questioner in queue is Cris Caso with Susquehanna.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I'm just wondering if you can address -- going back to some of the hard drive issues that the industry has faced over the last quarter or so. With your guidance in the second quarter, is that anticipation that there's some degree of channel restocking that goes on? Or are you anticipating that basically what you're shipping out is in line with customer demand for the quarter?","Rory P. Read","Well, again, as I mentioned earlier, I really believe that the hard file situation, based on the resiliency of this PC ecosystem supply chain, always works itself out. And we saw this really come fundamentally under control in early February. Any residuals in terms of demand issues from fourth quarter, which were relatively small, kind of moved past that. And we've seen that momentum continue through February and March. Again, there are some residual pricing issues around hard files because they haven't come all the way back down. That always takes a little longer to happen. But I don't see any reason that based on our expectation and guidance for second quarter, there's not anything significantly unusual driven by hard files at all.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And I guess as a follow-up, as you look into the second half of the year, your competitor is sort of pointing to a better-than-seasonal second half. A lot of that is driven by the Windows 8 launch and some of the product cycles that happened there. You've given -- would you guys endorse that view? What do you guys think with regard to the second half understanding that it's a better way now?","Rory P. Read","Well, clearly, based on when you look at the information from the big players: IDC, the Gartners, et cetera, Mercury, across the board, there's a general feel that 2012 is going to be better than 2011, and we agree with that. We believe that there's single-digit performance across the year. We think that it's going to build on itself quarter-on-quarter, but it's going to be nothing like a hockey stick or anything like that. It's going to be consistent improvement quarter after quarter. And what we want to do is to capture our own fair share of that growth moving forward.","Operator","Next questioner in queue is Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","First one on the -- the APUs increased as a percentage of the client products. I guess I would have expected the ASPs to also increase, so I was hoping you could provide some color on that one.","Rory P. Read","Well, remember, what we're doing is we're bringing that APU solution into those key price bands were we play strongly: entry and mainstream. And we've driven a nearly 30% year-over-year mobile processor, unit shipment increase. I think that's pretty exciting with virtually basically almost 100% of the first quarter mobile shipments now being APUs. We're targeting those price bands and we put those APUs right in those segments that allows us to create that great experience for the customer, that combined power of the GPU -- Graphics complex with the CPU complex on 1 SoC, allows us to create the experience that's tailored to the movement around the cloud, and how application and data are going to move information to these clients. That experience is unique. And by creating a great value proposition, that's how I think we're seeing this 30% year-over-year, basically 30% year-over-year mobile processor shipment increase. I think what we're doing here is positioning right into those price bands to continue this momentum. And now as we launch the next-generations, top to bottom, refreshing this APU with Brazos 2.0 and Trinity, and the amount of design wins that we've created, step-by-step we continue to build on this momentum in the mobile space and bringing APU across the board.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then on the -- as you launch Trinity, it sounds like you're going to be reaching a little bit higher, even into the performance area. Is that -- so is it fair to assume that there's going to be an upward bias on the ASPs as you ramp Trinity?","Rory P. Read","From a standpoint, there's no doubt that Trinity improves just about every key aspect of the previous generation of APUs. And it is a very exciting product. We did some prelaunch work with a number of analysts and press in a controlled environment. They were excited to see this product. And we're excited about this product. I think we're situated very well with our performance per watt, which is basically double the last family. And I think we can cover a wider slot in terms of that entry in mainstream portfolio between Brazos 2.0 and the Trinity family. But I believe that we should be looking to increase it, but it's not going to be in any gigantic number. We want to continue the momentum, continue to build on it and continue to build on this, quarter after quarter, through clean execution. Meeting our commitments to our global account and our partners, that's job one.","Operator","Next questioner in queue is Cody Acree with Williams Financial.","Cody G. Acree - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","As we look at Windows 8 launch and you look at ARM competitors coming in, look at Brazos 2.0 performance per watt, do you think that your roadmap for Brazos matches what maybe your competitor is doing with Atom and what you're seeing with ARM as getting down to that lower power envelope?","Rory P. Read","Yes, it's interesting. I think Win 8 is going to be more of an x86 event, in my opinion, having come from the OEM side of the business. I think it's an important event. I think it will generate interest. It will create demand. There's no doubt, forward and backward compatibility will be very important. And I think over time, lower power in the client space will be important. What we've done with Brazos is demonstrated, what, over 30 million units shipped in that within the first year, Brazos 2 builds on that. And then next year, as you've seen in our roadmap work at Analyst Day, the next generation of that family even takes it further. And I think what we believe is there is the opportunity for us to continue to win in that space with a great price performance, a great performance per watt, forward and backward compatibility, in a segment that's very attractive. For the other players that are now entering it, it's going to take a bit of time to build out that ecosystem. They've got to make sure that they've got enough performance to do the things that have to be done on that device, whatever. There were some other solutions that were introduced in the past that had difficulty as they moved into the segment because maybe they were slightly underpowered. We believe that we can reach the price points, the performance points and the power per watt that we need to do to win in this segment. And of course, we'll continue to work on our ambidextrous, agile architecture that will give us a lot of flexibility, both in the server and client space moving forward.","Cody G. Acree - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","Rory, I guess it brings up the question then, as you get the ecosystem up in the competitors, in the ARM-based systems, maybe longer term, I guess the question I get most often from investors is that after Windows 8 is a bit more mature and that ecosystem is more mature, what's to keep AMD from being marginalized as an alternative to Intel?","Rory P. Read","I think you're almost looking at it the wrong way. I think there's -- this is part of the inflection point that we talked about. Think about what that kind of convergence, right, and the cloud, those 2 Cs, are really going to do in terms of this processor and compute environment. This, where we play strongly, entry and mainstream, is going to be the dominant segment. And as you see us continue to drive low power into every one of our offerings and the capability with an ambidextrous architecture that reduces their time-to-market, gives us higher quality, allows us to do it with more efficiency and gives us flexibility across architecture with more consistent use of IP, I think that AMD is uniquely positioned to capture this. It isn't about following anybody and it isn't about being an alternative. That's not what it's about. It's about seeing where the market is going. And this market is beginning to change. And I think AMD with the technology, the architecture, the kind of skills that we have in the company, we play our cards right, this change in terms of this inflection point introduces an opportunity for us.","Operator","Next questioner in queue is David Wong with Wells Fargo.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","To begin with, sequential growth, 3% sequential growth that you're guiding for June. Is this organic growth or is there significant contribution from SeaMicro?","Thomas Seifert","Yes, very good question. That is very much organic growth. We said that while we see for a startup some substantial revenue this year in terms of the overall aggregated amounts and revenue we look at, it's very small. So next quarter, it's very much driven by AMD core organic growth. And you have to put this in perspective, over the last 7 years, our seasonality in the second quarter was about minus 4%.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And within this, do you expect server revenues will be up sequentially in the June quarter?","Thomas Seifert","We fully expect to continue to build on the momentum we have seen on the server side in terms of unit growth, yes.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And you -- the $605 million operating expense guidance for the June quarter, is this a GAAP number that includes amortization and other charges associated with SeaMicro?","Thomas Seifert","So what we have seen in Q1 was I think a one-time effect. We will have no spillover in terms of one-time effects. And then a bigger scale, maybe 3 million or 4 million, but they're already contemplated in that number.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And when you said earlier, 28-nanometer products going into production at GLOBALFOUNDRIES in the second half, that was one of your takes on the gross margin. Is -- these are GPU products, are they? Or do you have any microprocessor APU products in that mix?","Thomas Seifert","They are APU products. Yes.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","They are APU products? 28 -- so you will be, actually, you expect to be selling 28-nanometer APUs in the second half that are made at GLOBALFOUNDRIES?","Rory P. Read","No. No. No.","Thomas Seifert","From a volume perspective, very little volume. But we start the manufacturing ramp in the second half so we can get ready for the launches in 2013.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","My final question, are you able to supply all the demand you are currently seeing for 28-nanometer GPU products?","Thomas Seifert","I think we addressed that in one of the earlier questions. We were able to meet customer demand in the first quarter. The products are good. The demand is strong. We would like to see more access to upside volume but we have met all -- pretty much all demand in the first quarter.","Rory P. Read","Hey, Huey, before you go to the next question. I do want to make a comment. I apologize for anyone on the phone. I do refer to HDDs, the hard disk drives, as hard file. That's based on my IBM legacy from being in the IT environment. So if I confused anyone, when I talk about hard files, I'm talking about HDDs. So I apologize for that.","Operator","Our next questioner in queue is Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.","Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered but just a clarification, if you talked about this. Do you expect both Graphics and computing to be up in 2Q?","Rory P. Read","Graphics, what we've seen is a very interesting continued progress around the Graphics portfolio. We began the year the way we began 2011, with the fastest GPU card on the planet. And we believe that with the work that we're doing now here with 28-nanometer products across the entire discrete Graphics portfolio, we are very well-positioned. Now we're going to introduce the discrete Graphics around 28-nanometer into the notebook space. There is always going to be some slight pressure down as that market continues to move toward APUs. But I believe with the portfolio and product set and the introductions that we'll continue to do through the year, that we're positioned to continue to move forward.","Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So will that grow in Q2?","Rory P. Read","I don't really get into that specific. It's really part of the overall 3% -- plus or minus 3%.","Operator","Next questioner in queue is Patrick Wang with Evercore Partners.","Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","First question is, it looks like you're really focused on growing your core businesses. For instance, you're seeing growth in server but ASPs is declining despite a greater mix of Bulldozer. So I was hoping you could talk about your assumptions behind pricing trends over the course of this year, particularly as Bulldozer ramps and you get more Trinity and the Brazos 2.0.","Rory P. Read","Well, from a standpoint of server, it's about rebuilding our capabilities and relationships across the portfolio. Over the past several years, we saw our share position decline consistently in the server segment. What we've been on is we've got a renewed focus and the commitment to a long-term strategy to build a stead of server offerings. With the SeaMicro acquisition, it positions us in the fastest-growing segment of the server market. With Bulldozer, we began to build out our capability in terms of our go to market, our ecosystem relationship. And you're going to see us focus very, very well in terms of execution on server, because server is different than consumer products. You've got to deliver high quality, you've got to deliver on time, on schedule. That's what CIOs count on and they believe on. We've made good momentum in the first 3 quarters but that's just the beginning of the journey that we're on. This is a long-term game plan. And we're going to use this server experience here, and with the introduction of our next generations around Abu Dhabi and our future roadmap item, you're going to see us continue to move down that path. But again, long-term strategy. In terms of ASPs, this space is, again, there's always about the mix that you have and the certain deals that you win, we want to continue that momentum and then continue to build on that server space to create the base for future growth as we move both in the traditional server space and into the dense space. In terms of the APUs, we talked about it earlier. We're in the key price bands. We play very well in those price bands. We believe with Brazos 2.0 and Trinity, and with the design and interest around those 2 products, we're well positioned to continue the momentum that were created. Up 30% year-over-year on mobile processors unit shipments or just about, 100% are now APUs, we believe that we can continue to capture parts of this growing market moving forward that positions us well in that segment. And then again, the last piece on I'll answer it, Patrick, is around ultrathin. I think the ultrathins is a very interesting space for us. It's something we really need to watch. Ultrathins are for everyone. And ultrathins and thin and light are going to be a core product across the industry. This is nothing new. Thin and light has been going on for the past 15 years. We're taking it to the next level and we're going to bring it to everyone.","Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. So when I sit here and listen to what you're saying, it almost seems like ASP drift to the upside is almost less important because you're really targeting the more mainstream segments that may just require lower ASPs. Is that the right way to think about it?","Rory P. Read","Well, you always want to have a balanced perspective, right? This isn't a full out attack where it's all about just share. We're in a balanced perspective. Thomas and the financial team have constructed a strategy that allows us to expand earnings and allows us to position future growth. We're on a balanced approach. We're going to make sure that we're gaining and competing well in terms of volume and share, particularly in emerging market, particularly in the key segments and price bands where we know the future glow and the inflection point will be. And we want to continue to build on that. That's how you want to do it. And at the same time, you want to make sure that the margin is there so that you could continue to drive the cash generation and the ability to invest in future opportunities to go forward. We want to -- this is not a one-trick pony. We want to build this on a consistent, sustainable model, quarter in and quarter out, year after year. That's what we want to be recognized as, an execution engine that delivers on its strategy and its commitments to its customers, shareholders and partners.","Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And then just lots of low hanging fruit in the server. Can you give us an idea of when you think you'll be double-digit market share growth once again -- market shares?","Rory P. Read","Yes, of course, I'd like to do it as soon as possible. That would always be good. But this is a long-term strategy. We've made some initial momentum. We're going to continue to build on that. But no, we're in this long term. We went after SeaMicro. We're building the traditional server space. You're going to see us continue to work in terms of ambidextrous capability. You're going to see us continue to work in terms of building out that roadmap. This is just the beginning of a long journey, and a journey that we believe we're making good initial progress. But it's, again, it's over a period of time that, that consistent execution will pay dividends.","Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Long with the hard file.","Rory P. Read","Yes, spent too much time in IBM talking about hard files. Sorry about that, everyone.","Operator","We do have time for one final question. Our final question comes from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Dean Grumlose - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","This is Dean Grumlose calling in for Kevin. I was wondering if you could provide, Rory, some comments on what you're seeing in the strength of the various geographies at this time and rate of recovery and also how this may line up with where you think your best opportunities maybe geographically.","Rory P. Read","Yes. There's no doubt, as this inflection point continues to accelerate, and it will over the next 3 or 5 years, that emerging markets are going to be key. Consumerization is going to continue to drive a different mindset around the commercial segments, around the client. You're going to see the next 1 billion or 2 billion customers in the PC segment around these converged devices come from those emerging markets. You're going to see us continue to focus on it. We talked about it in many of our strategy sections around low power and continue to drive down with ambidextrous capability and to attack and to win in the emerging market. We saw 21% year-over-year microprocessor revenue growth in the emerging market. That's a good start but we have to continue to build on that. If you look at the other regions, Europe is obviously a difficult environment in terms of its macroeconomic trends, something that we're watching very closely. I think we're performing reasonably well in that environment. But until some of the sovereign debt issues get solved, I think that\u2019s going to be a wildcard in terms of its velocity and its business expansion. I think North America has performed pretty well over the past several quarters. And all of the data that I read from external sources point to a reasonable consistent GDP growth that should be good for our performance in those mature segments like North America. But again, it's about the emerging market and winning in that over time.","Operator","Thank you, sir. And at this time, that does conclude our question-and-answer period. I'd like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.","Rory P. Read","Thank you, Huey, and thank you, everyone for your time on the call today. We delivered solid results in the quarter, largely due to improved execution and a richer product mix. We expect to build on this financial and operational momentum, making consistent improvements quarter in and quarter out. We remain focused on creating innovative solutions our customers need to win, while building a company around a strategy that produces strong cash flow and earnings growth. Thank you, again, for taking the time to join us on the call today.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Again, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's program.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ruth Cotter, Chief Human Resources Officer and Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Ruth Cotter - Chief Human Resources Officer and Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications, Investor Relations","Thank you and welcome to AMD's second quarter conference call. By now, you should have had the opportunity to review a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary and slides. If have you not reviewed these documents, they can be found on AMD's website at IR.AMD.com. Participants on today's conference are Lisa Su, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Devinder Kumar, our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. This is a live call and will be replayed via webcast on AMD.com.","I'd like to take the opportunity to highlight a few dates for you.

You'll also find detailed discussions about our risk factors and our filings with the SEC and in particular, AMD's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 26, 2016.","Now, with that, I'd like to hand the call over to Lisa. Lisa?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Thank you, Ruth and good afternoon to all those listening in today. Our ongoing focus on diversifying our business model and delivering great products is creating solid market and financial momentum. Looking at the second quarter specifically, strong semi-custom demand and better than seasonal graphics sales drove a 23% sequential revenue increase and our return to non-GAAP operating profitability.","We also recorded our first full quarter licensing gain from our China server JV, with THATIC and improved our balance sheet with cash proceeds from the formation of our ATMP joint venture with NFME. Looking at our computing and graphics segment, revenue decreased 5% sequentially as stronger than seasonal GPU sales were offset by a decline in desktop processor sales. First half 2016 GPU sales increased by a double digit percentage from a year ago, as the investments we have been making to develop leadership graphics hardware, software, and drivers combined with new marketing campaigns are paying off.","Our strong second quarter graphics performance was capped by the launch of our new Polaris-based RX 480 GPUs at the end of June, which helped contribute to our highest desktop channel GPU shipments since the fourth quarter of 2014. The Radeon RX family resets expectations around the experiences and features gamers now want in a mainstream GPU. We are pleased with the Polaris launch, initial channel sales, and OEM design wins. We expect this strong demand to continue and help drive revenue growth in the third quarter, with the launch of the RX 470 and RX 460 desktop GPUs and Polaris-based notebooks from our OEM customers. We also delivered our third straight quarter of sequential professional graphics revenue growth and believe we gained share driven by increased adoption of Firepro graphics by OEMs as well as several cloud data center GPU compute wins.","In client, mobile APU sales increased for the third straight quarter, partially offsetting decreased desktop processor sales led by channel softness in China. Shipments of our recently launched 7th generation APUs are ramping well and outpacing sales of our 6th Generation APUs at this point in their life cycle. More than 25 new 7th generation APU systems, including several premium designs, are expected to be widely available in the coming months, from Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP and Lenovo, providing us with confidence in this part of our business as we enter the seasonally stronger second half of the year.","Turning to our enterprise embedded in semi-custom segment, our 59% sequential revenue increase is the largest since our first full quarter of semi-custom product shipments in 2013. As in the previous two years, we expect semi-custom shipments to peak for the year in the third quarter, as both Microsoft and Sony prepare for the holidays. Based on strong demand, we believe semi-custom unit shipments and revenue will grow on an annual basis.","Last quarter, at E3, Microsoft announced two new members of the Xbox One family powered by AMD. The Xbox One S is the slimmest Xbox console ever and the first to support HDR. The system is expected to go on sale in the coming weeks.","Microsoft also announced their next generation game console, codenamed Project Scorpio for the 2017 holidays. Project Scorpio is designed to be fully compatible with existing Xbox One software while leveraging AMD's leadership gaming technologies to create more immersive 4K and VR gaming experiences. Project Scorpio is one of the semi-custom design wins we communicated previously.","Our next Generation Zen processor products passed several key milestones in the quarter as well. I'm excited to report that in addition to conducting the first public demonstration of our next Generation Zen-based processors at COMPUTEX in June, priority server customer sampling began in the quarter and dual socket server platforms are now running at both our labs and our customers' labs. We are pleased with the performance we are seeing with Zen hardware, which is helping to expand our customer engagements and accelerating design win momentum across multiple OEMs and ODMs. We remain on track for volume shipments of our Zen server CPU in the first half of 2017.","In closing, over the last 18 months we have been diligently executing our strategic plan to improve our financial performance by delivering great products, strengthening our customer relationships, and simplifying our business. In the past six months alone, we released our game changing Polaris architecture, completed our ATMP JV transaction, announced a JV and IP licensing transaction with THATIC, and returned to non-GAAP operating profitability.","While we recognize we have more work to do, we believe that based on the ongoing ramps of our semi-custom SoCs, Polaris GPUs, and 7th generation APUs, we can deliver full year revenue growth in 2016 and non-GAAP operating profitability in the second half of the year.","We also remain focused on delivering our roadmap of high performance products and technologies, including Zen and our next generation Vega GPU architecture that can drive long-term growth.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our second quarter financial performance.","Devinder Kumar - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP","Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. The second quarter was a strong quarter, punctuated by better than expected financial performance, driven by demand for our semi-custom SoCs and the closure of our ATMP joint venture transaction with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics, which bolstered our cash position.","Second quarter revenue was $1.027 billion, up 23% sequentially, driven by higher sales of semi-custom SoCs. The year-over-year revenue increase was 9% with higher sales in both reportable segments.","Gross margin was 31%, down 1 percentage point from the prior quarter, primarily due to a higher mix of semi-custom SoC sales. Operating expenses were $342 million, up $10 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to increased marketing investments. We also recognize a $26 million licensing gain associated with our JV with THATIC and restructuring credits of $7 million, primarily related to facilities. We are pleased to report operating income of $3 million this quarter.","Net loss was $40 million with loss per share of $0.05, calculated using 794 million basic shares in the quarter. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $150 million, related to the ATMP JV transaction, an equity loss of $3 million based on our 15% ownership stake and taxes of $27 million related to the JV transaction. Adjusted EBITDA was a positive $36 million, compared to negative $22 million in the prior quarter.","Now turning to the business segments. Computing and graphics revenue was $435 million, down 5% from the prior quarter, primarily due to decreased sales of client desktop processors and chipsets. Revenue was up 15%, year-over-year, largely driven by higher client notebook processor and graphics sales.","Computing and graphics segment operating loss was $81 million, compared to $70 million the prior quarter, primarily due to lower revenue. Enterprise, embedded and semi-custom revenue was $592 million, up 59% from the prior quarter, and 5% higher than the prior year, driven by higher semi-custom SoC sales.","Operating income of this segment was $84 million, up from $16 million in the prior quarter, driven by higher revenue and a $26 million IP licensing gain compared to a licensing gain of $7 million in the first quarter.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $957 million at the end of the quarter, up $241 million from the end of the prior quarter, primarily due to net cash proceeds from the ATMP JV transaction, offset by working capital needs in the quarter. Inventory was $743 million, up $68 million or 10% from the prior quarter, and higher than guided in support of expected higher semi-custom sales in the third quarter. In the second quarter, we recorded a $62 million investment on our balance sheet related to our 15% ownership stake in the ATMP JV.","Total wafer purchases from GLOBALFOUNDRIES in the second quarter was $75 million, and year-to-date, we have purchased $259 million. That as of the end of the quarter was $2.24 billion, flat from the end of the prior quarter and includes total borrowings of $226 million on our secured revolving line of credit.","Free cash flow in the second quarter was negative $106 million, compared to a negative $68 million in the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to the inventory build in support of strong second half revenue.","Now turning to the outlook, which is based on a 13 week fiscal quarter. For the third quarter of 2016, we expect revenue to increase 18% sequentially, plus or minus 3%, primarily driven by our graphics and semi-custom products, including the ramp of new semi-custom business. Non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 31%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $350 million, due to an increase in R&D investments. IP monetization licensing gain to be approximately $22 million. To maintain non-GAAP operating profitability, non-GAAP interest expense taxes or other \u2013 and other to be approximately $45 million, cash and cash equivalents to be approximately flat, and inventory to be approximately %700 million. And lastly, for the full year 2016, we expect low single digit revenue growth year-over-year.","In closing, we are pleased with the progress we made this quarter. We launched exciting new products in the second quarter, with more expected to come to help drive strong revenue growth and improve financial performance in the third quarter. We recognize there's a lot more work to be done to return AMD to sustainable profitability and free cash flow generation, and look forward to continuing our progress over the coming quarters.","With that, I'll turn it back to Ruth. Ruth?","Ruth Cotter - Chief Human Resources Officer and Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications, Investor Relations","Thank you, Devinder. Operator, if you could poll the audience, please, for our question and answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. We'll now be conducting a question and answer session. Our first question today is coming from the line of David Wong from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks very much. My first question, can you give us any detail on the ramp in dollar terms of revenues from new semi-custom products in the September and December quarters, and what the seasonal pattern of these products might be?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Sure, David, this is Lisa. Let me start with that. So, our semi-custom business overall, we see as strong for the year. I think the predominant business is the current generation game consoles, and as they ramp into the second half and the stronger holiday season. We expect the seasonality of semi-custom to be similar to prior years, where we'll see a peak in the third quarter and decline in the fourth quarter, and we will see the new business layer in, starting in the third quarter, but I don't expect that to change the seasonality pattern. So you know, we're building up for a strong holiday season overall.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks, Lisa. And since the launch of your Radeon 480 graphics product end of last month, have you been able to supply to demand for the cards or if not, when do you expect demand will rise to match supply?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Yeah, so, David, we're very pleased with the launch of the Radeon RX 480. We had good supply at major retailers on launch day. Since then, the demand has continued to be strong and so some of the retailers are out of supply. We do see that the 14nm LPP yields are good and we are ramping up production steeply. So we expect that that will equalize as we go through the quarter. We are also very soon going to launch the rest of the Radeon RX family. And so you'll see three products in the third quarter in terms of overall product momentum.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Thanks for taking my question. The first one, Lisa, maybe for you. The China licensing deal was \u2013 I thought it was creative and fascinating. Can you characterize kind of the pipeline of IP deals that you have or technology deals? Is this it or do you have more in the pipe? Can you talk about timing or the types of deals you might be working on?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Sure, Mark. So the China JV, as you said, we announced it last quarter and it's now in operation. It's actually going well. So we're on track for some of the important milestone deliveries that we had. In terms of the overall pipeline, I would say we have a nice set of interesting opportunities. They are very much \u2013 as you know, they take a while for them to come to fruition. But we feel good about the model, which is partnering with folks that need high performance technology and we'll continue to work those deals as we go through the next couple of quarters.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great. A follow-up, if I may. I was hoping that you could just help me with the accounting of the semi-custom design wins. If I remember properly, there was two that you expect in the back half of this year and then one, I thought it was the first half of next year. So Scorpio is one of those three? But that's next year. So that's the one for next year?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Yeah, let me help you out with the accounting. I know that we've had several different pieces of information on the semi-custom new design wins. So, what we've said is we'll have a total of three semi-custom new design wins that will account for about, let's call it $1.5 billion of revenue, approximately, over the next three to four years. We're starting the ramp of new business this coming quarter, this third quarter, and that will be one of the semi-custom design wins. Scorpio is also a design win, and that, as our customer has said, will be in 2017, and we'll give you more information about the third one as we have more visibility.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","And do you have more design wins that you just haven't announced or mentioned timing of?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Well, we're trying to get out a little bit of the counting game, but I think, overall, we're pleased with the semi-custom pipeline. I think some of the questions that we've been asked are, do we believe we have design wins outside of game consoles, and the answer is yes. We have design wins outside of game consoles. I think we view the pipeline as good and it's a business model that works well with our high performance technology slant and our SoC capabilities.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. That's very helpful.","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Matt Ramsay from Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Lisa, I have a couple of questions on Zen. You gave some color in your prepared remarks about server opportunities for Zen starting in the first half of next year. Maybe you could give us a little color on potentially what markets you're going after there, where you see the opportunities. It seems to me that a lot of different moving parts in the cloud market with OpenPOWER and ARM and then custom CPUs from Intel. But a pretty big enterprise space that's x86-captive for you guys to go after, so I'd just be interested to see what the strategy is going forward there and where the design wins might come from.","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Sure, Matt. So, let me give you a little bit of color of how we see it. First of all, look, Zen is a brand new CPU design and we had very ambitious goals for it.","Given where we are today, it's actually coming up very well. We've demoed both desktop systems and now we have server systems working in both our labs and our customers' labs. I would say as the progress of Zen is \u2013 goes along in terms of validation, the customer interest has increased, and so we did close a number of design wins in the second quarter, and we have a number more in the pipeline, as we go into the third quarter and more widespread availability.","Our view is, Zen is a general purpose server architecture that can play in many different places. So you mentioned the cloud. I think that's certainly one target market, given the growth there. We also see there are workloads that would be particularly fit well for sort of the performance areas that we're targeting. I think enterprise is also again very much a target area for Zen. What we're looking for, again, is ensuring that we have a very high quality launch, and so we're working very closely with customers to make sure that we run their workloads and demonstrate the performance improvements that we expect. But as I said, overall, it's going well and we continue to work with customers to ensure that they see the benefits of Zen and working with AMD.","Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thank you for the color and it's good to hear. I guess another question on Zen, more in the PC markets, because I think your prepared remarks focused a bit more on server, but maybe you could give us a little bit of an update in the timing of desktop and notebook potential launches. It just seems to me, going into the holiday season, it's still a little unclear as to where Zen is going to land relative to holiday ramps in the Western markets and to Chinese New Year. So any color around that would be really helpful. Thank you.","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","No, that's a fair question, Matt. We have been very focused on the server launch for first half of 2017. Desktop should launch before that. In terms of true volume ability, I believe it will be in the first quarter of 2017. We may ship some limited volume towards the end of the fourth quarter, based on how bring up goes and the customer readiness. But again, if I look overall at what we're trying to do, I think the desktop product is very well positioned for that high end desktop segment, that enthusiast segment in both channel and OEM, which is very much a segment that AMD knows well and so that's where we would focus on desktop. You should expect a notebook version of Zen, with integrated graphics in 2017, and that development is going on as well. And so, I think it's just a time of a lot of activity around the Zen and the different Zen product families.","Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thank you very much. Congratulations on the return to profitability.","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Thanks, Matt.","Devinder Kumar - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I was looking at the implied guidance for Q4. You said for the full year up low single digits, so call that 3%, but it would imply Q4 down, 16%, 17% sequentially, and actually down on an absolute basis lower than I would have thought. I think Q4 has an extra week in it. I was wondering if you could give us some color on how we see the drivers for seasonality going from Q3 to Q4 across both of the businesses, given the trajectory of the different product launches that we have in the back half. Like, how do you come to that number?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Sure, Stacy, maybe I'll start and then see if Devinder would like to add to it. So look, when we started the year, our expectation is that we would grow revenue in 2016, versus 2015, but we were coming off of a very low base in the first quarter. So we've been pleased with how it played out, certainly in our second quarter revenue and the third quarter revenue guidance.","Overall, the businesses are performing well. So we do expect both computing and graphics and EESC to both grow for the year. I think the semi-custom business is the large driver of the fourth quarter, in terms of just how we see the overall business playing out, but the computing and graphics business is playing out as you might expect. So, the second half should be seasonally higher. Certainly with Polaris and as we launch broader availability across the product line, as well as the seventh generation APUs as they go into back-to-school and holiday. So that's the way we should think about it.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. For my follow-up, I just wanted to take a look at your notebook shipments in the quarter. So they were up again sequentially, I think they were up double digits in Q1, I think they were up in Q4 as well. So three quarters in a row of sequential increases, obviously off of a low base as well. How confident are you \u2013 what's driving that? Is it actually sort of sell out that's actually driving the demand or is this sell in into the channel? And how should we think about that potentially normalizing?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Yeah, so if you're talking about the notebook computing business. Actually, we are kind of pleased with how it's performed. So if you look at it, overall the \u2013 our OEM customers have adopted our technologies. So we see that across both notebook and desktop, but presumably notebook. We are also making progress in commercial and that was a very important initiative over the past five or six quarters, and so that's been nice to stabilize the business. And, again, I don't believe it's a sell-in phenomenon. Actually, it's consumption share that we see increasing. I think we have a reasonable opportunity to add to that in the second half of the year. But it's really around our products and the platforms that we're putting together with the OEMs.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Got it. If I could ask one more really quick. I was just a little surprised at how much your wafer purchases at GLOBALFOUNDRIES came down quarter-over-quarter, given the increase in notebooks as well the timing of the Polaris launch. Should we read anything into that?","Devinder Kumar - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP","I think basically the purchases of the wafers are in line with product demand and mix of business and as I said in the prepared remarks, year-to-date we've purchased about $260 million of wafers and we are getting into the back half of the year, which as you can see, with our revenue guidance in Q3, is pretty strong.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse group. Please proceed with your question.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yes, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question and congratulations on orchestrating the turnaround. I guess, Lisa, my first question, I'd kind of like to get your view on the news earlier this week around SoftBank and ARM. You're sort of in a unique position because you're both a partner with ARM as an ARM licensee, but if you look at your custom silicon business, especially on the x86 architecture, you can make the argument that you're a little bit of a competitor as well. So I'm kind of curious how you see kind of the reaction to that from a customer perspective, and does that change your view of how you might be able to monetize your own IP in the future?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","John, thanks for the question. Look, I think it's a very interesting deal. The ARM-SoftBank deal. I think we have a lot of respect for ARM. They are a close partner. I'm not sure we would call them a competitor. Overall, they are a partner. As it relates to how we think about our IP, we really believe that our IP, particularly the high performance element of it, on the microprocessor and the graphics side is very unique and in some sense, there are very few places in the industry where you have access to it. I think the applications that need it, whether you're talking about consumer applications or enterprise cloud applications are growing. And so it's an opportunity for us to look for larger markets to monetize, beyond just our own products. And that's in general the way we think about IP monetization. We have a set of products that is very important to our business model, but our IP can go further than our products themselves, and so we would continue to look for opportunities to monetize our IP.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And then guys, I apologize if I missed this, you commented on your expectations for GPUs going into Q3 and for semi-custom. How do you view the PC outlook within your total outlook of up 18%? And then I've got a quick follow-up.","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Sure, so let me talk about the PC market overall. I think our view of the PC market is pretty similar to others in the industry. We would say overall for 2016, high single digit decline. We have seen some positive signals and we saw some positive data points from IDC earlier the last week, and then we saw a little bit of pickup in consumption in June from our OEM customers, but, again, that was compared to, let's call it a soft April\/May.","Our view is OEM business looks okay. The channel for us is still weaker than we would like, and that's our view of the PC business. Even in that framework, we believe we can grow our computing and graphics business on the strength of the products. The graphics products, we've talked about as they ramp in the second half of the year. And on the computing side as well, I think we have a number of new platforms and back-to-school and holiday are important for us. So, that's the way we would characterize PCs.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So, Lisa, not to put words in your mouth, but for Q3, PC is up, but perhaps not up as much as seasonal? Is that the best way to think about it within your guide?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","I would say, roughly seasonal. I mean roughly seasonal.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That's helpful, and then last thing here. I apologize, but Devinder, now that you've got revenue growth behind you and you've got some momentum here, how do we think about the gross margin progression from here and kind of the puts and takes? I know there's a lot of different dynamics there including the mix of semi-custom, but from these levels, how should we think about gross margin progression over the next, call it two to four quarters?","Devinder Kumar - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP","Yes, John, I think the way you think about it is, it is the mix of business. So that's a good observation, but also you see us making continuing investments in our roadmap, in graphics and other areas. And we believe that will help us improve the gross margin. And then as you look out longer term, as you observe, get beyond a couple of quarters and get into 2017, we do have the Zen product introduction coming up. We also have a partner (33:36) in the pro graphics area, and that should drive even higher gross margins compared to where we are today, given the mix will get better with those products.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thankful. Thanks, guys.","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for taking my question. This is Sidney Ho calling in for Ross. Just a follow up to the last question, but focusing on the third quarter. You guided third quarter gross margins to be flat, but the profile of the revenue growth seems to be \u2013 would suggest gross margin should decline on a mix-adjusted basis. How should we think about gross margin by segment in Q3? What are some of the moving parts? And maybe follow-up to that, do you expect a gross margin of the new custom design wins ramping this quarter to have better or worse margins than the game console business?","Devinder Kumar - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP","Yeah, I think that's well put. I mean, if you look overall, when we have a higher mix of semi-custom business, typically the gross margin is lower since the business model on the semi-custom side imparts a lower gross margin, just the way the model is constructed. So keeping it flat at 31%, with the guide in Q3 versus where we were in Q2, we were pretty pleased with that and I think you are seeing some of the strength underlying the non-semi-custom business is allowing us to keep it flat quarter-on-quarter.","Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then my follow-up question is, you guys talked about the Zen products at COMPUTEX and it's on track to launch in the first half of 2017. Can you talk about the impact on R&D expense and maybe on gross margins on the preparation of this launch over the next few quarters? And if you hit your revenue plans that you have thought about, at what point do you need to start increasing OpEx from the $330 million to $350 million level?","Devinder Kumar - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP","You know the OpEx side of it, if I look at it from that standpoint, you have seen our OpEx actually go up, and in Q3 we are guiding the $350 million level, with specific targeted investments we are making in key R&D areas and products, in particular the high performance roadmap that we have laid out. We are also making some specific investments in the marketing area, given the new products that are coming out on the PC side as well as the GPU side. Trying to attract end users back to the AMD brand and I think you are continuing to see us do that. And that helps obviously with these new products underlying the better margins that you get with the fresh cycle and particularly with the new technology areas that we are putting our products in.","Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, and maybe just one quick follow-up. For Q4, with an extra week in the fiscal quarter, should we expect OpEx to be at the high end of the level, that will be enough, with the $350 million?","Devinder Kumar - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP","I'm not prepared. One of the things about OpEx is I always say, even if you look at Q3, the OpEx is up on a guided basis at $350 million, but very much as I always say, we manage the OpEx really tightly. We've done that over the last several years and obviously it gets modulated somewhat by revenue. Q3 revenue is up 18%, OpEx is at $350 million, and we'll talk about Q4 when we gather here in about 90 days.","Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. I was also curious about the GLOBALFOUNDRIES being so low in Q2. And I guess, have you guys finalized the 2016 wafer supply agreement, and can you talk more generally about how you're deciding which products are allocated to GLOBAL and TSMC and is there anything that's exclusive to one or the other?","Devinder Kumar - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP","Yeah, several parts to it. The working relationship, as Lisa said, with GLOBALFOUNDRIES is very good. We continue to work through the 2016 WSA and that part's now finalized. We are in the process of negotiating that. In the meantime, we continue to get delivery of wafers for the products that we need in line with the product demand and mix of business. And relative to your \u2013 which products on which foundry, we typically do not share the source of foundry for any of our wafers or products.","Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's fair. And then with regards to kind of thinking about next year's OpEx, when you look at the importance of a CPU that can attack the server market and can attack the high end of the sort of enthusiast CPU market, I guess I don't want you necessarily to be constrained by the R&D requirements of the last couple years. So how do you think about that if you start to show some revenue traction? I mean, can you \u2013 how much flexibility do you think there is on spending? And I'm not asking for a number, but just qualitatively how are you thinking about profitability versus investing in these opportunities next year?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Joe, I would say my engineers would be very happy to hear you say that. So, look, I appreciate the question. I think you've seen and Devinder said this, we're going to be disciplined in OpEx, and, as this quarter was an important turning point for us, to return to operating profitability. I think we have a nice sort of a view into Q3. We will look for opportunities to ensure that we are strategically placing the big bets in R&D. And, both on the CPU and the GPU side. For example, this year we have ramped up our investments on the graphics side with the formation of the Radeon technologies group, and what we're doing in both hardware and software, very significant investments and similarly on the CPU side as well. I think we take very seriously our commitments in terms of profitability, but we will invest in the future and we'll continue to look for opportunities to balance those in the right way. I don't know, Devinder, do you want to add anything?","Devinder Kumar - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP","No, I think that's well said. 2017, obviously as we get to the back half of the year, Q3 we've guided, we're getting to that, get through Q3, and get into Q4, and at that point, we'll start thinking about where we want to place our bets as these are put in in terms of the longer term investments in 2017. Right now, we are really focused on getting \u2013 we got to non-GAAP operating profitability this quarter. We want to maintain that in Q3 and then we'll see what happens from there.","Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Christopher Danely from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Marco Chen - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, this is Marco Chen calling on behalf of Chris Danely. Thanks for letting me ask the question. My first question is, could you please update us on your expectations on the static x86 server JV in China? Are there any potential legal risks with it, potentially Intel?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Yes, so relative to the server JV that we have with THATIC, as we stated before, we believe that our joint venture is operational. I think it's well underway. The technology that we're licensing is AMD technology, and so we don't have any issues relative to licensing. I think -","Devinder Kumar - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP","Yeah, if I may add. One thing on the update, I guess, if you look at the prepared remarks and the commentary for Q3, is we now expect, based on technology transfer milestone completion, to recognize $22 million of licensing gain in Q3 and approximately $75 million for the year, which is higher than what we had said previously when we said it was $52 million for the year. So it's incremental and therefore, as Lisa said, things are presently (42:02) on track and we continue to meet our technology transfer milestones from a date standpoint.","Marco Chen - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","That's very helpful. Thank you. And then my follow up. I know you guys mentioned PCs and graphics segment should be up year-over-year. Could you guys get into more detail and maybe talk about each segment individually, so your trend for PCs versus GPUs?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Yeah, we don't usually go into granularity about the sub segments of the business. I think it's fair to say that our PC business has stabilized, and what we're seeing now is the opportunity as we go into the seasonally stronger half of the year, on both the PC side and the graphics side, on top of that, with some new product launches. We believe that we will end up growing year-over-year. But, again, we don't usually guide to details within a segment.","Marco Chen - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Please proceed with your question.","Ting Pong Gabriel Ho - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. This is Gabriel Ho calling in for Ambrish. Thanks for taking my question. I have a follow-up on your Project Scorpio comment. I think it's going to be launched in 2017, and I think you have significantly higher performance and support for 4K (43:19). So how should we think about maybe the pricing or ASP that compared to what you have indicated on the current generation game console platform?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Yes, so, again, we wouldn't disclose anything that's incrementally more than what our customer has disclosed. So I think Microsoft has talked about their goals with Project Scorpio. I think we are in support of those goals. Given the performance level, you would imagine that there's more capability on chip, but I wouldn't want to go more than that.","Ting Pong Gabriel Ho - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. As a follow-up, I think your competitor has launched a comparable mainstream product. I think GeForce 1060, so and given the absence of your maybe higher performance part launching, maybe to the second half. So how should we think about the rest of the year on the demand on your graphics side?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Yeah, we are feeling very good about our Polaris launch. This was our strategy from the beginning. We laid out a strategy where we were going after the mainstream, and trying to create really a new experience in terms of both capability and price point, and I think we've done that. We're also very, very focused on the X12 and our performance on new APIs like Vulkan. So we're happy with our competitiveness. I think it's played out as we thought it would do.","Certainly, our aspirations in GPU are to certainly have very competitive products across the entire product line and so we've talked about working on Vega, which is the next generation high end architecture, but in terms of our competitiveness, we again, we've executed what we thought we were going to execute and it seems like from both customer reviews and analyst reviews, that it's pretty well received by market.","Ting Pong Gabriel Ho - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you.","Ruth Cotter - Chief Human Resources Officer and Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications, Investor Relations","Operator, we'll take two more callers, please.","Operator","Certainly. Our next question is coming from Ian Ing from MKM Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC","Yes, thank you for fitting me in. So, EESC looks like you achieved operating income, same level as third quarter of last year, but with $45 million lower revenues. So, just wondering how you got more profitable in this segment, given these are both strong game console quarters and also you got annual price declines in game consoles, I assume. Thanks.","Devinder Kumar - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP","I think if you look at the profitability, you've got to remember in the EESC segment, we also have the businesses embedded, for one, and also the investments we are making for the enterprise side of it, with the data center product that's coming out in 2017. So, the profitability \u2013 you are right about the observation, but profitability depends upon, obviously, the largest business we have in there right now is the semi-custom business, but also the investments on the OpEx standpoint that we make year-on-year, and we talked about the targeted investments we were making in some of the product areas.","Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC","Okay. Great, but these are relatively older products then, embedded and enterprise products at the moment then, it sounds like. Okay. Great. And then my follow-on is, you had a one-year cadence for GPUs now. Can you talk about expectations on how last year's R9 300 Series winds down and how that plays out? It looks like in Q2, there was really just a lack of a pause ahead of a known refresh and do you expect sort of a sharp wind down at some point or is it more gradual?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Actually, Ian, that's a good observation. The 390 series or the 300 series overall, actually did do okay in the second quarter. We were also wondering whether there would be a pause prior to a new generation. I think we see it as a very orderly transition. It's actually one of our better product transitions as we go from the 300 series over to the 400 series. So, again, nothing very spectacular to report, other than the sell through has continued \u2013 the sell through was good in the second quarter and we believe that it's an orderly transition of the inventory.","Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Thanks, Ian.","Operator","Thank you, our final question today is coming from Jaguar Bajwa from Arete Research. Please proceed with your question.","Jaguar Bajwa - Arete Research Services LLP","Yeah, hi, thanks for taking my question. Just a question on Q3. Could you just lay out which will be the fastest growing sequential segment in Q3? Will that be the GPU business, the CPU or semi-custom? Thanks.","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Jaguar, I think what we would say is that our Q3 guidance is, you know, both semi-custom and graphics will be the drivers of the sequential revenue growth.","Jaguar Bajwa - Arete Research Services LLP","Okay. Thanks. And then could you just give a bit more clarity around Vega timing? And also what do you expect to be your differentiation here versus what NVIDIA has done with Pascal?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Again, I think we'll talk more about the details of the Vega architecture in time, but certainly Vega is a high performance GPU that will use high bandwidth memory as part of it. So, I would leave the details for a more \u2013 as we get closer to the Vega launch dates.","Jaguar Bajwa - Arete Research Services LLP","Okay, well maybe just one final one then. When we get into the server CPU cycle with Zen, should we expect any kind of contribution from an APU format with CPU plus Vega, because we are seeing a lot of acceleration now in the data center? Do you think that could be a key product for you guys, which maybe your competitors may not have, bringing an AP into the server market for high performance servers?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Yeah, I think it's fair to say that we do believe we can combine a high performance CPU with the high performance GPU. As we look at our GPU compute in general, both professional graphics and server markets for GPU, I think that will increasingly become an area of focus for us, as we continue to grow the graphics business. So I think the answer is yes. I mean, obviously it will come in time, but it's an area where combining the two technologies makes a lot of sense.","Jaguar Bajwa - Arete Research Services LLP","Okay. Thank you very much.","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Thank you.","Ruth Cotter - Chief Human Resources Officer and Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications, Investor Relations","Operator, that concludes the question-and-answer session.

All lines have been placed on a listen-only mode at this time. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, you will be invited to participate in the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Ruth Cotter, Vice President of Investor Relations for AMD. Please go ahead.","Ruth Cotter","Thank you, and welcome to AMD\u2019s second quarter earnings conference call. By now, you should have had the opportunity to review a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary and slides. If you have not reviewed these documents, they can be found on AMD\u2019s website at quarterlyearnings.amd.com.","Our participants on today\u2019s conference call are Rory Read, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Devinder Kumar, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and in addition we have Lisa Su, our Senior Vice President and General Manager of our Global Business Unit who will participate in the question-and-answer session. This is a live call and will be replayed via webcast on amd.com.","And before we start, I\u2019d like to highlight a few dates of interest for you. Matt Skynner, our Corporate Vice President and General Manager of our Graphics Business Unit will attend the Jefferies Semiconductor and Hardware Summit in Chicago on August 28. Lisa will present at Citi\u2019s Global Technology Conference on September 4 in New York. Our third quarter quiet time will begin at the close of business on Friday, September 13th. And lastly, we intend to announce our third quarter earnings on October 17th and dial-in information for that call will be provided in mid-September. Please note we renamed our Graphics segment to Graphics and Visual Solutions. This better reflects the growing importance of gaming and semi-custom offerings to AMD. In addition, please note that non-GAAP financial measures referenced during this call are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the release and CFO commentary posted on our website at quarterlyearnings.amd.com.","Before we begin, let me please remind everyone that today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date, and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. You can refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information. You will also find detailed discussion about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC, and in particular, AMD\u2019s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 30, 2013.","Now, with that, I\u2019d like to hand the call over to Rory. Rory?","Rory Read","Thank you, Ruth. We are making progress on our three-step strategy to restructure, accelerate, and ultimately transform AMD for growth. This progress allowed us to deliver improved results in the second quarter. Revenue of $1.16 billion was higher than our guidance as strong demand helped drive sequential unit shipment increases and market share gains across both of our business segments.","With our restructuring complete, our focus in the second half of the year is on continuing to accelerate our business. We expect a return to profitability in the third quarter based on the midpoint of our revenue guidance. Our traditional PC business is heading into the typically stronger second half of the year with a competitive portfolio of new products and strong mobile design wins, particularly persistent in the $300 to $600 sweet spot of the market. Many of these systems will be the first to bring touch capabilities down into the mainstream price points, where AMD has traditionally been the most successful. We remain on track to deliver more than 20% of our revenue from our semi-custom and embedded businesses in the fourth quarter. With growth in the second half of the year primarily coming from our semicustom SoC products for both the Sony and Microsoft next generation game consoles.","These tailored products are great examples of the opportunities we have to quickly diversify our product portfolio and enter into new markets where our IP and design capabilities provide us with a competitive advantage. Looking more closely at our progress and the PC market, our strategy to gain share by introducing a new set of APUs and winning high volume notebook designs across key customers by region, price point and form factor help drive strong double-digit sequential increases in mobile processor unit shipments.","With our mobility APU launches last quarter we now offer the broadest range of mobile processors in our AMD history. Our new elite mobility APUs scale down below 4 watts, well more than doubling the performance per watt compared to our previous generation. We\u2019re seeing strong adoption of these new APUs. This is particularly true of our high volume Kabini which is powering a number of thin and light touch notebooks that will hit the $400 price point.","Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Samsung have begun to rollout products based on our latest APUs and we expect many more systems to launch in the second half of the year. We also continue to make progress rebalancing and strengthening our channel business. The introduction of a Richland APU help drive a sequential increase in desktop processor channel revenue. We expect to continue to build on this improving channel trend in the second half.","Turning to our server business, a number of large data center wins in the quarter drove sequential revenue and unit shipment increases. Additionally we continue to gain momentum in the emerging dense server market as customers are choosing AMD SeaMicro offerings for their data centers based on the industry leading energy efficiency, density and bandwidth of our solutions. We intend to have further attack the fast growing portion of the server market in 2014 by introducing our next generation X86 APUs and CPUs as well as our first ARM-based server product.","Our years of enterprise design experience and the ability to integrate our industry leading dense server fabric into the processor provides us with a differentiated product for this new and exciting market.","Now turning to our graphics and visual solutions business. Our strategy to make AMD the de facto standard for game developers continues to gain momentum as we launch the industry\u2019s fastest desktop and mobile graphics chips and cemented our position as the technology provider of choice for all three next generation game consoles. In the high and enthusiast portion of the desktop\u2019s GPU market, the combination of our powerful graphics products and the Never Settle game bundle program drove significant share gain and a richer mix in the channel from the previous quarter. Our professional graphics business also recorded it's four straight quarter of growth delivering record revenue as we continue to aggressively pursue this lucrative market. Looking at second half of the year we believe we have good opportunities for growth based on the PC market strengthening slightly from the first half levels and the ramp of our semi-custom business. Longer term, the 300 million plus unit traditional PC market remains an important part of our core business, especially at the mainstream $300 to $600 system price points that have been traditionally been our sweet spot become an even larger portion of the overall PC market. We will continue transforming AMD, leveraging our design expertise and IP to pursue additional growth opportunities for our semi-custom, ultra-low power client, professional graphics, dense server, and embedded solutions. We expect these high growth businesses will account for 40% to 50% of our revenue in the next two to three years.","In summary, we are pleased with the progress we are making to restructure, accelerate, and ultimately transform AMD as strong demand for our latest products drove improved financial and operational results in the second quarter. We expect to deliver significant revenue growth in the second half of the year as our strong new products position us to gain share in our traditional businesses, and our first semi-custom SoC win allows us to participate in new markets. We are on track to reach our operating expense target of approximately $450 million, and we expect to return to profitability in the third quarter based on the midpoint of our guidance. We are excited about the near-term opportunities to demonstrate our efficient business model, disciplined operational focus, and diversify product strategy that will deliver consistent profitability and growth.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Devinder. Devinder?","Devinder Kumar","Thank you, Rory. Phase 1 of our three-phase turnaround and transformation strategy is largely behind us. We are now pursuing a diversification of our product and revenue portfolio with a focus on high growth market opportunities. As Rory mentioned, our performance in the second quarter was driven by both traditional PC and new growth opportunities, which support our business model transformation in an evolving PC market. We are on target to generate 20% of our revenue outside of the traditional PC space to semi-custom and embedded products by Q4 2013. The last phase of transformation over the next two to three years is expected to see us transition 40% to 50% of our revenue base to higher growth markets, which include semi-custom, dense server, professional graphics, ultra-low power client, and embedded products.","Revenue for the second quarter of 2013 was $1.16 billion. The 7% sequential increase was driven by a 12% increase in the Computing Solutions segment, which was partially offset by a 5% decrease in the Graphics and Visual Solutions segment. Gross margin was 40%, a decrease of 1 percentage point sequentially and includes an $11 million benefit from the sale of certain products previously reserved in Q3, 2012. You may recall that Q1, 2013 gross margin of 41% included a similar benefit of $20 million. Excluding these benefits, gross margin was flat at 39% for both Q2 and Q1, 2013.","Non-GAAP operating expenses were $479 million, and we remain on track to achieve our operating expense goal of $450 million by the third quarter of this year. Non-GAAP operating loss was $20 million and non-GAAP net loss was $65 million. Non-GAAP loss per share was $0.09 calculated using 752 million basic shares. This loss per share includes a $11 million benefit from the sale of previously reserved products. Adjusted EBITDA was 54 million an increase of 14 million from the prior quarter due to the lower operating loss.","Now switching to the business segments, Computing Solutions segment revenue was $841 million up 12% sequentially due to significantly higher notebook and higher server and desktop unit shipments primarily driven by demand for our new Kabini and Temash offerings as well as our latest Opteron 6300 series of products.","Client product revenue and server microprocessor revenue increased sequentially. Computing Solutions, operating income was $2 million, an improvement from an operating loss of $39 million in the prior quarter.","Graphics and visual solution segment revenue was $320 million, down 5% compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to lower game console royalties. Graphics and visual solution segment operating income was breakeven compared to $16 million in the prior quarter.","We continue to diversify our product portfolio into new markets where the competitive dynamics are different, in the semicustom space for example the market is differentiated from the rest of our business as our customers engage with us very early to jointly define and fund engineering development of customized products. Development revenue and the associated cost are incurred during the development cycle of the given products. When the semicustom products ship to the customer we generate silicon sales and the associated ongoing OpEx is significantly lower than our non-semicustom products due to the Opteron funded development.","The semicustom model has the potential of providing a long term revenue stream based on high volumes which results in gross margin that is lower than the corporate average but has significant revenue and earning power as volumes ramp. Under this model the majority of gross margin dollar\u2019s fall due to operating income and the operating margin for this business will be in the low double-digit range more than offsetting the impact of the lower gross margin. In addition as we transition the shipping silicon products, game console royalty revenue included in the semicustom business is expected to decrease moving forward although the decline will be more than offset by our growing semicustom development and product revenues.","Turning to the balance sheet, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance including long-term marketable securities was $1.1 billion. During the quarter AMD made a $40 million cash payment to GlobalFoundries related to the 2012 wafer purchase commitment reduction and exit of the quarter and our target optimal cash level and well above the target minimum cash level of 700 million. That as of the end of the quarter was 2 billion flat from the prior quarter.","Inventory was 711 million up 98 million sequentially largely driven by semicustom products and a ramp of new products in the PC space to support growth in the second half of the year. Accounts payable at the end of the quarter was 402 million up 101 million compared to the end of the first quarter of 2013 due to the timing of purchases and payments.","Depreciation and amortization was 54 million down from 62 million in the prior quarter primarily due to the sale and lease back of our Austin, Texas Lone Star Campus.","Now turning to the outlook, for the third quarter of 2013 AMD expects revenue to increase 22% sequentially plus or minus 3%. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 36%, despite expecting revenue to increase significantly quarterly operating expenses I expected to decline approximately 6% sequentially to around 450 million. Expense management will continue to be a focus area for us as we move forward. At the mid-point of revenue guidance, AMD expects to be profitable at the net income level. Inventory is expected to increase sequentially to approximately 800 million largely based on semi-custom product builds. We expect inventory to remain at those levels for the coming quarters consistent with the ramp of our semi-custom business and cash is expected to remain flat sequentially at approximately $1.1 billion.","In summary, in the third quarter, we will build on the strong foundation we have established as we remain laser-focused on execution and returning to profitability in the third quarter and positive free cash flow generation in the second half of the year.","With that, I will turn it back to Ruth. Ruth?","Ruth Cotter","Thank you, Devinder. Operator, we\u2019d be happy to poll the audience for questions now please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, ma\u2019am. (Operator Instructions) And our first question in queue will come from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America","Thanks for taking my question. First question, could you help us, Rory, differentiate between the growth prospects for your traditional PC and server segments versus the game console opportunity in Q3, and then if you can give us any initial sense for Q4?","Rory Read","Sure, Vivek. As we look forward, we see a continued opportunity in the PC segment. While we see it only slightly stronger than the first half and I believe down year-to-year, I think there is an opportunity for us with our stronger product portfolio to continue to build on the momentum that we saw in the second quarter. Clearly, the market is moving down into the entry and mainstream price points, where we\u2019ve played very well. And I think this is a very good opportunity for us to continue to build share. Now, having said that, clearly the momentum and acceleration of revenue will come from the new segment as well as off of that initial base, but those SoCs that we want in semi-custom are going to be a key driver moving forward in 3Q as we have guided.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America","So, just one follow-up on that, Rory, I think yesterday Intel guided to about 5% or so sequential growth in their PC and server segment, is that roughly how we should be thinking about your traditional business and then whatever is left is the new opportunity?","Rory Read","Well, I see the overall PC market in the second half growing in the mid-single digit level. And what I would like to do is to achieve that or exceed that so that we could slightly gain share.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America","Got it. And one last one for Devinder, Devinder I think you mentioned low double-digit operating margin from the new wins that you have in consoles, I assume that is exclusive of the royalties and is that an initial profitability level, and does it get better than that or is that sort of a run-rate level over time?","Devinder Kumar","I think we are giving guidance for Q3 and guiding to the low single-digit from a Q3 standpoint. As you can imagine, this business, the semi-custom business and game console, in particular, has a long lifeline and over time the mix between the ASPs and the cost can change, so looking out in the future it\u2019s hard to tell, but at least at the starting point for the next couple of quarters I would target at the low double-digit.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, sir. And our next question will come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley","Great, thank you. Also on the console questions, how does the pricing work to you guys is only good (type issues), is there any kind of yield risk to your profitability there, and I have a follow-up on that?","Lisa Su","Yes, Joe this is Lisa. So, the game console SoCs are really as we would do. There are wafers that we expect good solid yields from. We\u2019ve had very good bring up and so we are looking good with the prospects.","Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley","Okay, great. And then how do you think about the ASPs in that business over the next some of years, is that a volume-based thing, is there a time, are there times when prices come down or just how does the price negotiation work over the course of the next few years, and that (there is one)?","Lisa Su","These are long-term deals that we have with the customers given the range of the length of the design win, so, these are pre-negotiated.","Rory Read","And Joe what you would expect is you would expect what we have seen in the historical trends around game consoles; these generally run somewhere between 5 and 7 years and you would expect that overtime that prices would move lower but obviously expense and cost will move with it. What\u2019s powerful about this business is you can see a significant increase in our revenue quarter-to-quarter as we begin to ramp this at the same time you see our expense level decline by almost $30 million to the 450 level showing the benefit of doing that NRE (ph) customer funded development and how it flows through to the bottom-line at that double-digit level.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities","First question looking back just briefly the upside that you had, can you walk through a little bit what drove that surprise, I know the computing solutions group was up 12%, was that mainly the Temash uptick or anymore color you can give us there would helpful, please.","Rory Read","Yeah I think we saw strong momentum in the new product segment and obviously Temash and Kabini did well. I think Lisa has seen a good uptick in the graphics arena as well and in the desktop channel area. So we basically saw it in every part of our business progress quarter-to-quarter. Now of course we\u2019re building off of that lower base as we saw the market fracture at the end of last year but that\u2019s a good foundation given these new products and the uptick that we\u2019re seeing there.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities","The ASP decline also driven by the new products, so it's a strategic decision in part of addressing those notebook price points that you mentioned earlier Rory?","Rory Read","Well from my perspective what you\u2019re going to see is basically a mix discussion. We saw a very, a good performance in our entry in mainstream price points and I think it's basically a mix area. We\u2019re focused on moving up the stack with the Richland offering as well as balancing that off with the new SoCs from the gaming and server areas. So I would say it's mix Ross.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities","And I guess one final question on the gaming side of things, how do we think about eventual seasonality in that business. Do we have good two, three quarter ramp before we even have to worry about that?","Lisa Su","I think the way to think about game console seasonality is like any consumer business, the first half is usually lower than the second half. Of course we\u2019re in the middle of the ramp process so the second half of this year will be the ramp-up of the consoles but I would expect the first half would be weaker as most consumer cycles are.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities","Even in the first half of \u201914 or is the ramp probably going to overcome any seasonality at that point?","Lisa Su","I would still expect a typical consumer seasonality.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your question please.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities","Lisa maybe a follow-on to that Ross Seymore question, given that we\u2019re early in the ramp phase, anyway of quantifying the sequential ramp and gaming from Q3 to Q4 to kind of hit some of the unit numbers that are out there in the popular press to how many of the gaming systems might be built for the Christmas holidays? Any way to give us some sort of color of how much of that\u2019s falling in Q3 versus Q4?","Lisa Su","Yeah John that\u2019s hard to say given that the customers are really dictating their ramps. I\u2019ll say that as Rory said earlier a strong part of our guidance in the third quarter is as a result of the semicustom ramp and we expect to ship a number of units over board both the third quarter and the fourth quarter.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities","Helpful and then Rory you guys did a good job kind of helping us understand the profitability in the gaming system. I\u2019m just kind of curious as we see the launch of new products in the core compute and server market you\u2019re slightly above a breakeven operating level in the June quarter, how do we think about profitability in the core business. I know especially given that you gain market share in the second quarter, breakeven was probably a little bit lower than I would have expected, so how does that picks a sort of track through the second half of the year with the new products and market share gains.","Rory Read","Well I\u2019m actually pleased with the progress to move back to profitability at the mid-point guidance, driving to that level is something we\u2019ve talked about over the past three, four quarters and I think we\u2019re executing well to deliver that. You\u2019re seeing a movement in the revenue up and the control of the expense down, and a nice new set of products that are coming out. That I believe we can continue to build on. The PC segment as I talked about earlier in the call, the market is choppy. There is no doubt that market will continue to be choppy the next 12, 18 months. In spite of that, that market is over 300 million plus units. That\u2019s a great opportunity for us and a key component to our future strategy. We want to grow and we want to take share there.","Now, to augment that and to balance off our expense and reuse our IP, let\u2019s take that IP and technology and apply it into these new high growth segments. You are beginning to see the power of that model emerge here in the 3Q quarter. Now, we have to execute and we need to execute through the end of the year, but that\u2019s the fundamental structure of the business model, Devinder and I and the team are creating.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities","Thank you.","Rory Read","Thanks John.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question will come from David Wong with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","David Wong - Wells Fargo","Thank you very much. Given the pre-negotiated pricing patterns you have for the game console chips, do you expect once you are at full volumes, do you expect your annual revenues to grow each year or should we expect them to be fairly flat once you are at full volume with unit growth being offset by pricing declines?","Rory Read","Yes, I think what\u2019s important to think about David is we are talking about third quarter guidance next, and as we go through this process, I think what\u2019s best for you is to look at the historical game console trends over time. I think that\u2019s a pretty good indicator of how this business goes. For us, I think there is a very good opportunity for us to build on this. And of course, Lisa and her team are continuing to build the pipeline in the semi-custom business to attack areas in the server segment, in the home segment, areas where graphics and our technology will play. We want to continue to build out this custom momentum. So, it becomes a very substantial portion of our business going forward. And I think it uniquely positions AMD to create differentiated solutions with our customers, David.","David Wong - Wells Fargo","Okay. And sort of related to this, you guys have said low double-digit operating margin for the console chips, does that put gross margin in the mid-teens?","Rory Read","We wouldn\u2019t talk about gross margin at that level of the business. Devinder has got commentary that shows you in the two business segments that we talk about. I think what you are going to see is that, that business is a good business for us with significant revenue growth managing the expense profile moving forward, flowing profitability to the bottom line, and that\u2019s what we have talked about as part of our strategy to diversify the portfolio.","David Wong - Wells Fargo","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Rory Read","Thanks David.","Operator","Thank you, sir. And now our next question will come from Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James","Thank you. Congratulations on the outlook. A comment or a question regarding your positioning with Temash and Kabini with one or two quarter lead over the upcoming Bay Trail, what is the competitive positioning or the advantage that you have besides being first to market versus that device that Intel is going to be shipping later in the year? Thanks.","Lisa Su","Yes, Hans, if you look at our Temash and Kabini offerings, I think we are very pleased with overall performance both on the processing side and the graphics side and the adoption through the OEMs. We do have the time to market advantage and that proves good when you look at on the systems that will be on the shelf both starting this quarter and into the summer. And as we go forward, we think we are well positioned versus Bay Trail as well. So, I think this is an important segment for us to continue to grow in and that some are plans.","Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Christopher Danely with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Christopher Danely - JPMorgan","Hey, thanks guys. Can you just maybe comment on the expected term line of OpEx after this quarter and then since you are opening up the kimono on the gaming opportunity, maybe talk about your some of your goals for the combined growth and operating margin targets longer term for the company?","Devinder Kumar","I think the way I would look at it Chris is the following, right. We are on target to hit the $450 million in Q3 of 2013, and beyond that, we are going to be laser-focused to look at the mix between the OpEx and the revenue. And as Rory talked about as the revenue evolves over time whether it's a semicustom business or the traditional business that we have we keep an eye on that and if you take for a moment that there is going to be an uplift in revenue, we\u2019re going to watch them very carefully and what I would say is the increase in OpEx if any would be significantly lower than the increase from a viewpoint of the revenue that\u2019s the way I would look at it. This is really moving to a model which is very different than we have had in the past and with the OpEx reduction that you\u2019re seeing in Q3 with a significant increase in revenue it demonstrates the earnings of the model in particular when you\u2019ve a business that can drop low double-digit to the operating margin and obviously the bottom-line from an overall standpoint.","Devinder Kumar","And Chris on the expense side very important to think about how we\u2019re working on our overall processes and execution. The idea of Ambidextrous architecture and reusable IP. This is what you\u2019re seeing, the power of Jaguar as a core showing up in semicustom offerings into server chips, into all the way to client chips. This is the model on the journey that we\u2019re taking to dramatically improve the efficiency of how we create SoCs, leverage our IP and we have been investing to go get some of the best industry talent and Mark Papermaster\u2019s team and Lisa\u2019s team have really build out that technology leadership but it's around that expense part that you want to see us continue to manage this very tightly and we should not be scaling that in a significant way moving forward.","Christopher Danely - JPMorgan","And combined margin targets for the company, would you care to update us on that?","Rory Read","It's 36% this quarter and that\u2019s a mix of the revenue that we have going from Q2 to Q3 and we\u2019re not giving long term guidance of gross margin at this point.","Christopher Danely - JPMorgan","Sure and then just one housekeeping item, you mentioned that you\u2019re ramping the gaming opportunity this quarter, should we think if the gaming opportunity is being the primary driver for growth in Q4 or will the ramp be done by the end of this quarter?","Rory Read","Q2 to Q3 the gaming opportunity is a primary driver, we\u2019re not talking about Q4 at this point.","Operator","Thank you sir. Our next question will come from Stacy Rasgon with Stanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Stacy Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","First you said that you have obviously the game console royalties that are there now rolling off, my understanding that was about on annual basis a $100 million to $150 million a year. So if you\u2019re running with low double-digit operating margins in the console business even at a $1 billion a year in revenue that seems to be just enough basically over the long term to offset the loss in game console royalties, is that the number one I guess as a magnitude of those numbers correct and is that right way to think about this?","Rory Read","I can\u2019t comment on the magnitude of those numbers as you can imagine but what I can tell you is at what time as our business model is transitioning, we\u2019re going to be in the silicon and development NRE (ph) model in the semicustom business and what you should look at it from an overall standpoint whatever you peg the revenue to be for that business the fall through due to the operating margin line because we\u2019re going to be very operating margin focused as opposed to our traditional historical gross margin outlook that everybody has been focused on the AMD model because this is truly a transition going from one business model that we have had in the history of the company to where it's evolving into more focus on operating margin as opposed to gross margin alone.","Stacy Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","But it is fair to say there is a loss of royalty revenues is going to impact any gains in operating income from the console business.","Rory Read","That depends, it's all speculation depending on how much the increase is in the semicustom and game console business, can\u2019t really speculate on that.","Stacy Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Okay great. I have one more quick question, so this has to do with your wafer commitments to GlobalFoundries. I think right now your current commitments for this year $1.15 billion that is flattish to last year and a PC environment that even according to you guys is right now kind of anything but flat. Are all of the console chips we made at TSMC or can any of those console chips actually go to satisfy your wafer commitments to GlobalFoundries and if not is there a risk of a repeated last year where you had a big turf (ph) I think you\u2019re even still on the hook to pay for about $200 million in wafers that you didn\u2019t need in 2012 and pay for those in the first quarter of 2014, what\u2019s the risk around the wafer supply agreement, is it different to the growth?","Rory Read","Many finds (ph) are made and I think the key thing I would leave you with is you know we do have a commitment this year as you called it a $1.15 billion, be on track to meet the commitments. And as we finished half the year here, approximately half of those obligations have been extinguished. The $200 million that you referred to is part of the termination that we did for 2012 and the market took a downturn and that $200 million is due in our Q1 2014.","Stacy Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","So, does that imply that some of the consoles which actually are being made at GlobalFoundries, because I don\u2019t see how you could have flat way (inaudible)?","Rory Read","We don\u2019t share level of detail in terms of our foundry strategy, where we make products between the foundries.","Stacy Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Okay, thank you guys.","Rory Read","Thanks Stacy.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question will come from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO","Hi, thank you. I am just curious Devinder and Rory, why would you not answer the long-term operating margin question that Chris was asking, and I understand it that the business is in transition and there are lot of moving parts, but Devinder, you said that you are running the business with operating margin focus, what is that focus, and I get it that the $450 million, you just delivered on the $450 million and the breakeven, but just trying to understand longer term, what are all the uncertainties that prevents you from giving us the longer term target? Thank you.","Devinder Kumar","I wouldn\u2019t classify it as uncertainty, but let\u2019s just go through what we have said from an overall standpoint. We are on target to get the 20% of embedded semi-custom by Q4 of 2013. We have also said very publicly that longer term we are targeting 40% to 50% of our revenue to higher growth markets and some of those businesses have higher than corporate average gross margins. So, you can imagine as you sit here in Q3 in essentially the first quarter, we are transitioning in a significant manner to a mix of revenue that\u2019s very different than what we have had in the past that there is going to be a transition over time, because there is two to three years to get to the 40% to 50% mix and that can obviously has an impact on revenue, ASPs, it can have an impact on the gross margin, and finally the all-important from my standpoint, the operating margin, because that\u2019s what close to the bottom line of the EPS. So, it\u2019s a transition and you are asking for the longer term model to be laid out in the first quarter where the transition is occurring and that\u2019s just difficult to do.","Rory Read","Yes, and you remember, we are executing a three-step turnaround strategy. We did the restructure. We have completed that. Now, we are in the beginning of the turn and the acceleration as we execute the product plan and the move, and then ultimately we transform the company to that 40%, 50% of the mix in a diversified portfolio on those high growth segments. Now, we are about four quarters, three quarters into this transition, and we are right on track on that strategy.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO","Okay, that\u2019s helpful, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question in queue comes from Romit Shah with Nomura. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Romit Shah - Nomura","Hey, thanks for taking my question. Just on gross margin, I want to understand if there is more than one moving part, driving gross margins from 39% and 40%, down to 36%, is it just the higher mix of console or are there other factors as well? Thanks.","Rory Read","Yes, I think going from Q2, Q3, primarily it\u2019s the higher mix of the game console business, that\u2019s driving from the 39%, 40% to the 36% guidance that we are providing.","Romit Shah - Nomura","And Devinder for computing, are computing margins going to improve sequentially in the third quarter?","Devinder Kumar","I am not going to give that level of granularity, but I think you can make the assumption that they are generally stable. We have been running in the 39% if you go back and adjust for the benefit we got from the sale of previously reserved inventory, we have been 39% for the last three quarters, and I think if you are making assumption it\u2019s pretty stable.","Romit Shah - Nomura","Okay. And then the final question for Lisa, you referred to the traditional consumer electronics market, I think in reference to your question about seasonality do you guys have any closer insight on how to think about this console business and the ASP declines that you may see in the upcoming year?","Lisa Su","I mean, again if you think about this, these are usually long-life products. And over 5 to 7 years, you will see cost reductions, I am going to place, but I think we have been clear that the business is a long-term business and we will continue to service it over that period of time.","Romit Shah - Nomura","Alright, thanks.","Rory Read","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you sir. Our next question in queue comes from Cody Acree with Williams Financial. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Cody Acree - Williams Financial Group Capital Markets","Maybe for Lisa on the embedded processing side, I know you guys have been working for quite some time in the console business. Can you just talk about maybe what the next opportunities maybe applications or end markets that you\u2019re targeting and maybe when we might start to see some of those layer?","Lisa Su","Yeah absolutely. So the semicustom and the embedded are both two important growth markets for us. Semicustom has been so far dominated by gaming but we see a lot of other opportunities, we have a strong pipeline that can similarly use our graphics and computing capability and some of the markets are things like other consumer, specialty servers those types of markets. Embedded processing is also important to us and we see in those markets X86 being a very valuable and industrial and medical and other casino gaming type opportunities and so we have been continuing to build that pipeline as well. Those design wins tend to be longer in nature and take about 12 to 18 months to get into production so that will be more of a 2014 phenomenon to see growth.","Cody Acree - Williams Financial Group Capital Markets","Thanks for the help and on X86, so you\u2019re moving forward with both in ARM and X86 strategy forcing Intel do similar on density on X86 so in the server side, if X86 can reach a similar density and power savings, do you believe there is still as large of a need for an ARM alternative?","Lisa Su","I think really we view ARM and X86 as two important eco-systems that are out there in the industry. So X86 will always continue to be very important in both the PC and the server market but we see ARM being important with the new market especially new operating systems as well as some of the high volume data center application. So yes there will be a market for both ARM and X86 and I think that\u2019s one of the unique things that we can bring over the next few years to the marketplace.","Cody Acree - Williams Financial Group Capital Markets","And then just following data then with your multi-pronged server strategy and the reductions in some of the head counts you had to go through. How confident are you that you\u2019re going to be able to address all of those different tracks without stretching your resources to it.","Lisa Su","Yeah that\u2019s a good question and I think the most important thing for us as a company is really the focus that we have been working on over the past 12 to 18 months has been around reuse and getting a strong reuse across our IP portfolio whether you\u2019re looking at our client semicustom embedded or server markets that use the same core technology, the sane graphics technology and we bring that together in our solutions for each market.","Operator","Thank you sir. Our next question comes from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs","I thought David Wong and Stacy had some good questions. I just wanted to try to follow-up on those little bit if I could, you know maybe another way of asking what they were asking was if you guys do not get other wins with these APUs this is a gross margin dollar neutral transition in gaming is that correct?","Devinder Kumar","I don\u2019t know what you mean by that question.","Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs","Well the point that Stacy is bringing up you lose an operating income and royalties, what you gain in operating income from APUs, so net-net it's a zero operating margin dollar exchange but then theoretically you have the opportunity to leverage these platforms to gain additional opportunities.","Devinder Kumar","Jim we have a real significant opportunity in this high growth segments to drive over the next two to three years to 40% to 50% of our revenue, that means these businesses are going to get significantly bigger and I think there is an opportunity for that to create very accretive and consistent profitability as we move forward.","Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs","Okay so no ability to get any granularity specifically on the first question I asked?","Devinder Kumar","I think we did.","Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs","Okay then thank you, I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you sir. Our next question will come from Christopher Rolland with Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Christopher Rolland - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co","Sorry to harp on the OpEx stuff but if you could talk about the gaming consoles expenses either on an absolute basis or at least in anecdotal basis what are the R&D and SG&A cost involved in supporting a launch like this and how do we sort of think about that overtime? Thanks.","Rory Read","I think I have stated in my prepared remarks. When you look at the semi-custom model from a game console standpoint, it is a very different model. It\u2019s a model where the costs are upfront funded jointly between the customer and us. You incur the cost, you are going into the product, and then the time of product introduction, you get the sales. It\u2019s lower gross margin than the corporate average, but the majority of the gross margin dollar\u2019s fall to the operating margin, and that\u2019s the benefit that we get at the bottom line from an overall standpoint. As far as the details of the business and how you manage it between the sales marketing, G&A, and R&D, our leads are coming in the second on the R&D and G&A, but from a marketing standpoint, I can tell you that there is not much, because essentially we are selling products to captive customers in this case and based with the marketing for the end product with consumers, and we supply the product. Lisa?","Lisa Su","Yes, so maybe to add a little bit more color to that, the way these products are defined we jointly define it with the customers. We leverage IP that we have across of our base businesses and then there is an engineering recovery done for the specific customization. Really, no measurable sales and marketing expense just given that it\u2019s pretty customer set, so the (inaudible) ratio is substantially lower than our corporate average.","Christopher Rolland - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co","Okay. Also do you guys see some synergies here perhaps with these next-gen consoles with PC gaming sort of driving sales of AMD graphics cards, like for example might some game developers optimize specifically for an AMD GPU or APU or is that sort of a stretch there, are there any sort of network effects here from gaming consoles across the PC?","Lisa Su","Yes, that we definitely believe there is a great synergy between the game console and the overall PC gaming market. I think gaming is one of the key pillars of AMD in our graphics and APU strategy. So, having the game consoles on the same graphics architecture does allow synergies in the software development and the work that we do with ISVs and we are pursuing that quite aggressively.","Rory Read","Yes, and there is no doubt is the PC gaming segment is one of the best performing segments in the overall PC market. And with this move of the game consoles, you see the key game developers writing to the technology first and we should expect better performance and better time to market based on that. This is clearly a franchise business that will spread across and create a network effect.","Christopher Rolland - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co","Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question will come from Patrick Wang with Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Patrick Wang - Evercore","Great, thanks a lot. My first question you guided for about $800 million of semi-custom inventory build this quarter, presumably good chunk of that shift in time for the holidays, can you give us some color to help us think about that and perhaps maybe a sense of how much revenue this supports?","Devinder Kumar","Yes, just to correct if that\u2019s what we said, that\u2019s how it intend, it\u2019s not $800 million game console inventory. There is inventory in the traditional business and actually predominantly it is in the traditional business. The growth in the inventory that I talked about going from Q2 to Q3 is primarily in the game console business to support the ramp that we are seeing in the second half of 2013.","Patrick Wang - Evercore","Okay, got you. So, I appreciate the clarification. So, that\u2019s the incremental inventory you would ship by the fourth quarter?","Devinder Kumar","Yes, you committed it to the products that we build for the customers. Obviously, there is a time lag in terms of getting the wafers and taking into the line and shipping with the customer. When you have a steep ramp in revenue like we are seeing from Q2 to Q3 you are going to have the increase in inventory probably ahead of the time of the ramp, and we ship the product essentially after we finish making it to the assembly and test processes.","Patrick Wang - Evercore","Got you. Thanks. Thanks for correcting me there. Secondly, it sounds like you plan to be cash flow positive either I guess this quarter or in the Q4, so a great job turning that around. I am just wondering is this accurate and then how do we think about the timing of your remaining payments to go (inaudible) in the Q1?","Devinder Kumar","Yes, two things I will say about cash. We have said even earlier this year, we plan to be free cash flow positive in the second half of 2013 and we are on target to do that. And the other thing we have been saying consistently is maintaining cash in the $1.1 billion level, optimal range. We have done that for the past several quarters. And in spite of the payment that\u2019s coming up in the Q1 2014 timeframe I can say that we should be maintaining cash as a $1.1 billion optimal zone level through that timeframe and even in the Q1, 2014 timeframe.","Patrick Wang - Evercore","And last question, you know Rory you talked about the dense server focus, obviously some of the challenge you\u2019re getting in SeaMicro, can you talk about the size of that business to-date that you got maybe a few catalyst you see on the horizon and then also when you think that could hit maybe I don\u2019t know 10% of sales.","Rory Read","Patrick from our perspective we comment on the overall server business, we saw a good solid quarter out of that. We believe that we took share in that server segment and key to that growth is the dense SeaMicro solution but we\u2019re really focused as well on the traditional server, there is opportunities with APUs in the dense space and of course our announcement around ARM server. So I think this is a nice combination of server offerings to move forward and build on.","Lisa Su","Operator we will be happy to take two more questions please.","Operator","Yes ma'am. Our next question in queue comes from Shawn Webster with Macquarie Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Shawn Webster - Macquarie Securities","So for Q2 you guys said that just flat and when I do the kind of bottoms up with the down ASP quarter for your microprocessors I\u2019m getting up something like 15% to 20% sequentially unit growth for Q2 for microprocessors versus the down let\u2019s say 1% for the global PC market. Can you help us understand or pass through maybe how much of that was your channel inventory rebuilding which you sound like some of that was happening, some new wins and anything else or share gains because it seems like a very strong growth for Q2?","Lisa Su","So as we said we did have a good quarter in the computing solutions group. When you look at the breakdown I would say that we had very strong notebook shipments and that was across our new product portfolio, we also had a little bit of pickup in desktop but I would say that that was more modest than notebook side.","Shawn Webster - Macquarie Securities","Can you characterize how you think inventory is sitting right now at your OEMs in your channel?","Lisa Su","I would say they are typical.","Shawn Webster - Macquarie Securities","Normal levels, okay. And then just another final quick one, the written down inventory benefit that you saw in Q2, is most of that out of the system at this point or are there still parts that you can sell at no cost going forward?","Rory Read","There is some left, I mean we had a 100 million that we took as a write-down in Q3, 2012, we had 20 million of that sold in Q1. We sold 11 million (ph) in Q2 and that benefited close to the gross margin. We have about 65 million left, we don\u2019t see anything on the horizon right now but as I said previously the approach that\u2019s taken and if something comes along and somebody wants those parts, will go ahead and sell those parts.","Operator","Thank you sir. And our final question will come from Glen Yeung with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup","Thank you. Lisa a question for you about the mix you\u2019re seeing in the PC client business just trying to understand if you\u2019re seeing any changes in your mix of product and does that product tell us something about the mix of the PC market and specifically I\u2019m trying to understand if you think it's a down shift for lower price points in PCs?","Lisa Su","Yes Glen so if you look at our mix, we have typically been stronger in those lower price points like call the $300 to $600 system range and we have seen strength in that area. So overall I would say our mix has shifted a little bit to the lower end and I think that\u2019s typical of the overall markets.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup","So just as a follow-up to that, Intel now is kind of openly saying that with Bay Trial they are one going to allocate a bit more sort of resources to that part of the business and perhaps more importantly key it sounds like they are going to focus more in that mid to low range part of the market. If you sense that, one, they will be more competitive there and then two, what are your thoughts around the implication of that to your share in margins in that part of the resource?","Lisa Su","Yeah I mean I think it's fair to say that that\u2019s where the market is focused so the customer focus as we get more Windows 8 based touch systems into that more mainstream price points, so I think that\u2019s a market shift. Clearly it's important to stay competitive in that area and we\u2019re continuing with our new product portfolio to do that. So I think overall we will continue to focus in that area and continue to be quite competitive.","Lisa Su","Operator that concludes our second quarter earnings call and we would like to thank everybody for participating and if you could close the call we would appreciate it.","Operator","Sure. Thank you presenters and thank you ladies and gentlemen. Again this does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Laura Graves. Please go ahead, Laura.","Laura Graves","Thank you very much, and welcome to AMD\u2019s fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 conference call. By now, you should have had the opportunity to review a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary and slides. If you have not reviewed these documents, they can be found on the Investor Relations page of AMD\u2019s website www.amd.com.","Participants on today\u2019s conference call are Dr. Lisa Su, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Devinder Kumar, our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. This is a live call and will be replayed via webcast on our website.","I would like to highlight a couple of important dates for you. Dr. Lisa Su will present at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media and Telecom Conference on February 26th","and our first quarter quiet time will begin at the close of business on Friday March 16, 2018.","Today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date, and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.","Additionally, please note that we will be referring to non-GAAP financials during this call, except for revenue and segment operational results, which are on a GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures referenced are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in the press release and CFO commentary, again, both posted on our website. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today\u2019s earnings press release and CFO commentary for more information. You\u2019ll also find detailed discussions about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC, and in particular, AMD\u2019s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2017.","Now, with that, I will hand the call over to Lisa. Lisa?","Dr. Lisa Su","Thank you, Laura. And good afternoon to all of those listening in today.","Three years ago, we set out a strategic plan to reshape AMD to become a high-performance computing leader through great products, deep customer relationships, and a simplified and focused business strategy. 2017 marked a key product and financial inflection point for AMD. Our newest wave of high-performance products and consistent execution created significant momentum for our business over the last year. Fourth quarter revenue of $1.48 billion grew 34% from the year ago period, and we significantly expanded our gross margin and improved profitability. For the full year, we increased annual revenue by over $1 billion, resulting in 25% annual revenue growth. We expanded gross margin and achieved full year profitability.","Looking at our Computing and Graphics segment in the quarter, we delivered very strong Q4 results as we continued the ramp of our Ryzen CPU, Radeon Vega GPU products. Computing and Graphics segment revenue increased 60% and we significantly improved operating income from a year ago.","Client computing revenue increased both year-over-year and sequentially. We outperformed seasonality in Q4, driving strong double-digit sequential revenue and unit growth, based on very strong sellout of Ryzen processors throughout the holiday season.","We expanded our Ryzen CPU family further into the consumer market with the introduction of the AMD Ryzen mobile processor with Radeon Vega graphics, combining the power of our Zen CPU and Vega GPU architectures into the fastest processor in the industry for ultrathin notebooks. Ryzen mobile-based notebooks are currently available from Acer, HP and Lenovo with multiple new systems expected from all top five PC manufacturers in the first half of this year.","In graphics, we delivered our second straight quarter of record GPU revenue with significantly improved ASP and increased unit sales from a year-ago driven by strength across our entire graphics product portfolio. We saw strong demand for our Polaris products across both the gaming and blockchain markets. And Radeon Vega GPU revenue more than doubled from the prior quarter, driven by strong gaming demand in add-in-board channel as well as strength with strategic OEMs.","Apple launched the new iMac Pro, the most powerful Mac ever made, featuring AMD\u2019s Radeon Pro Vega product in the quarter. We also began shipments of a new semi-custom GPU that is integrated into an Intel multi-chip processor package. This semi-custom product opens up a complementary market for our high-performance graphics products and extends the power of Radeon graphics to more gamers and premium PC buyers. Our professional graphics business, had its best quarter ever, based on growing data center sales, highlighted by strong Radeon Instinct, MI25 sales to a major cloud provider.","For the full year, Computing and Graphics segment revenue increased 54% over the prior year, as we launched more than 40 new high-performance CPUs and GPUs.","Turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Revenue increased 3% from a year-ago, driven by the ramp of our EPYC processors. Q4 server revenue and unit shipments increased sequentially and from a year-ago, as the market continues to qualify and deploy our family of high-performance EPYC processors. We closed dozens of new server deals in the quarter, securing key design wins with education, financial services and hosting companies. We also had several key announcements in the quarter, as we continue to see a steady drumbeat of adoption.","Microsoft Azure became the first public cloud instance, powered by AMD, with their L-Series of Virtual Machines, for storage optimize workloads. Hewlett Packard Enterprise began volume shipments of the EPYC based ProLiant DL385 Gen10 server, which recently set world records for floating point performance. Baidu deployed AMD EPYC single-socket platforms into their data centers, to power AI, big data, and cloud computing services. And Dell\/EMC has completed the qualification phase for their EPYC-based systems and will be sharing more on launch plans shortly.","Our reentry into the server market remains on track with a steady ramp of new platforms and deployments across our OEM and hyperscale data center customers. Our semi-custom business performed as expected in the quarter, as unit shipments declined from a year-ago, as we completed the fifth year of the current game console cycle.","Before I close, I\u2019d like to address the recent important security issues facing our industry. Security is and always has been a fundamental focus for AMD, across all our products. We are vigilant about security in both our product design and throughout the product lifecycle. As new exploits arise, like we have seen with Spectre and Meltdown, we are dedicated to responding with speed and focus to keep our customers and partners informed and protected. As a reminder, we believe Meltdown is not applicable to AMD processors.","For Spectre Variant 1, we continue actively working with our ecosystem partners on mitigations, including operating system patches that have begun to roll out. We continue to believe that Variant 2 of Spectre is difficult to exploit on AMD processors. However, we are deploying CPU microcode patches that in combination with OS updates provide additional mitigation steps. Longer term, we have included changes in our future processor cores, starting with our Zen 2 design, to further address potential Spectre like exploits. We continue to collaborate closely with the industry on these vulnerabilities and are committed to protecting AMD users from these and other security threats as they arise.","In summary, we are very pleased with our quarterly and full year results. We made significant progress in 2017, as we completely reshaped AMD\u2019s product portfolio and launched a highly competitive set of new products.","In 2018, we expect to increase our momentum with the next wave of premium products and expanded go-to-market activities to increase our market penetration. In the client market, we will expand our rising portfolio with new product launches, including AMD Ryzen desktop processor with Radeon Vega graphics which is expected to deliver the industry\u2019s highest performance graphics engine in a desktop processor.","Our second generation Ryzen desktop CPU, based on our higher performance 12-nanometer Zen+ architecture and for business notebooks, our AMD Ryzen Pro mobile processors with Radeon Vega graphics. We are also expanding our go-to-market activities with our OEM and retail partners, and we expect to launch more than 60 new Ryzen OEM systems throughout 2018.","In graphics, the launch of Radeon Vega mobile products will expand our Radeon Vega line-up into high-end notebooks. Later this year, we plan to sample our first 7-nanometer Vega GPU, optimized for machine learning. In addition, we will continue increasing our software investments around machine learning to address the growing demand for an open ecosystem in the GPU compute space.","In the server market, we will continue to work closely with major cloud vendors and OEMs to ramp their first generation EPYC-based systems while also completing key development milestones on our next generation Zen 2 based server platforms. Our Zen 2 design is now complete and we will be sampling to our customers later this year.","2018 is clearly a defining year for the ramp of our server business and we remain focused on our goal of achieving double-digit market share in this important market segment.","2017 laid a solid foundation with strong financial results and significant progress towards achieving our long-term goals. I am even more excited about 2018 as we continue our journey to position AMD as one of the premier long-term growth companies in the tech industry.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter financial performance. Devinder?","Devinder Kumar","Thank you, Lisa. And good afternoon, everyone.","2017 was a pivotal year for AMD. We grew annual revenue 25% over 2016 with revenue growth increasing every quarter on a year-over-year basis, culminating in growth of 34% in the fourth quarter of 2017. In addition, we expanded gross margin by 3 percentage points and achieved GAAP profitability for the year.","Computing and Graphics annual revenue grew 54% in 2017 while Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom annual revenue was flat. Both segments posted operating profits for the year and it is particularly noteworthy that the Computing and Graphics segment was profitable for the first time in six years.","Based on the overall strength of the business and our new, high-performance products, we have set a strong foundation for achieving our long-term financial model.","Now, let me turn to our results for the fourth quarter of 2017. Total revenue of $1.48 billion grew 34% year-over-year, driven by strong Radeon and Ryzen product demand. On a sequential basis, revenue declined 10%, better than expected, driven by seasonally lower semi-custom sales and partially offset by strong demand for new CPU and GPU products.","Gross margin was 35%, expanding 3 percentage points year-over-year, primarily due to a larger portion of revenue coming from computing and graphics, driven by our new, high-performance products.","Operating expenses were $412 million compared to $357 million a year ago. The increase was driven primarily by R&D and new product go-to-market investments, partially offset by an R&D credit related to a technology development agreement. Operating income was $103 million, up significantly from $26 million a year ago and operating margin was 7%, up from 2% a year ago.","AMD received a onetime tax credit of $18 million as a result of U.S. corporate tax reform, which resulted in a net tax benefit of $8 million in the quarter. Net income was $88 million or diluted earnings per share of $0.08 as compared to net loss of $8 million or $0.01 per share in the year-ago period. Adjusted EBITDA was $142 million compared to $60 a year ago and adjusted EBITDA for 2017 was $445 million.","Now, turning to fourth quarter business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $958 million, up 60% year-over-year due to strong sales of our Radeon graphics and Ryzen desktop processors. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $85 million compared to a loss of $21 million a year ago. The strong improvement was due to higher revenue.","Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $522 million, up 3% year-over-year, driven by server revenue. Operating income was $19 million, down from $47 million a year ago, primarily due to the absence of a licensing gain and ongoing R&D investments, partially offset by the benefit from a richer product mix.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.18 billion at the end of the quarter, up from $879 million in Q3 due to significantly higher cash flow from operations. Inventory was $739 million, down slightly from the prior year and down 7% from the prior quarter.","Total principal debt including our secured revolving line of credit was $1.7 billion. In the fourth quarter, we deployed cash to repurchase $38 million of long-term principal debt, resulting in a total reduction of long-term debt of $138 million in 2017. Our gross leverage ratio has improved from 10 times in 2016 to 3.8 times at the end of 2017.","Free cash flow was $339 million, up sharply from $32 million in the prior quarter. Q4 is typically our strongest cash flow quarter. And for the year, free cash flow was $45 million negative due to increased working capital in support of higher revenue.","Before we turn to guidance, I want to highlight that we are adopting the revenue recognition accounting standard, effective 2018. We are adopting this standard under the full retrospective method, which we believe is most helpful to our investors. For the full year 2017, the impact of the accounting change to revenue was immaterial and we expect the impact to be immaterial on 2018 annual revenue.","For the first quarter 2018, AMD expects revenue to be approximately $1.55 billion, plus or minus $50 million, an increase of 32% year-over-year, primarily driven by the strength of the ramp of Ryzen GPU and EPYC products. For comparative purposes, under the new accounting method, Q1 2017 restated revenue was $1.18 billion and Q4 2017 restated revenue was $1.34 billion.","In addition, for Q1 2018, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 36%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $435 million or approximately 28% of revenue, non-GAAP interest expense taxes and other, to be approximately $30 million and inventory to be up sequentially in support of higher revenue.","For 2018, we expect double-digit percentage growth in annual revenue, greater than 36% non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 28% of revenue. In addition, we expect a tax rate of approximately 10% of pretax income for 2018.","In summary, we made significant progress in 2017. We are pleased with the momentum in our business and delivered outstanding topline revenue growth, margin expansion and achieved profitability for the year. We continue to make strong progress towards our long-term target financial model. And our goal in 2018 is to deliver significant revenue growth and increased profitability as we continue to invest in our multi-generational, high-performance product roadmaps.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Laura, for a question-and-answer session. Laura?","Laura Graves","Thank you, Devinder. Operator, we\u2019re ready for our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] Our first question today is coming from Hans Mosesmann from Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Hans Mosesmann","Hi. Thank you. Congrats on the quarter and guide, guys. Can you please give us the puts and takes for the Q1 guide? There is lots of moving parts. And so, I think that would be helpful. Thanks.","Dr. Lisa Su","Yes, absolutely, Hans. Thanks for the question. So, our Q1 revenue guidance was up 32% year-on-year. And if you take a look at that, it\u2019s actually significantly better than our typical seasonality. Primarily, that\u2019s due to the new products strength. So, we see GPUs, Ryzen and EPYC all up in Q1, and that\u2019s contributing to the strong guidance. We do expect that the semi-custom business will be down in Q1 relative to the first quarter of 2017, just due to the fact that we\u2019re in the sixth year of the cycle. So, if you actually take the new product strength, the guidance is actually over 32% year-on-year.","Hans Mosesmann","Okay. And the seasonality of the semi-custom will continue to be weaker on a year-over-year basis for the rest of the year, is that the way to model that?","Dr. Lisa Su","Yes. So, what you should expect with semi-custom is on a full year basis, the revenue will be likely down compared to 2017 just due to where we are in the cycle, and units will be down. There will be a bit of an adjustment to the seasonality as we move over to the new accounting regulations with 606. And so, we will see, let\u2019s call it, a bit more revenue in the first half and a bit less revenue in the second half. So, for the year, it is very similar and then we\u2019ll see a little bit of shift in the quarterly profile. But again, back to your question, your initial question on the Q1 revenue guidance, it is really driven by new product strength.","Operator","Our next question is coming from David Wong from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.","David Wong","Thanks very much. Following on from your answer to Hans\u2019 question, Lisa. Can you give us some feel for the revenue -- the new product momentum in terms of sales in the fourth quarter 2017? And in particular any numbers on Ryzen and EPYC or Vega, absolute sales dollars or sequential growth in Q4 would be helpful.","Dr. Lisa Su","Yes, absolutely, David. So, we had a very strong Q4. If you look at the overall business, it was up 34% year-on-year. If you look underneath that, the Computing and Graphics business was very strong. So, we saw a 17% sequential growth, significantly better than seasonality. That was up on clients, particularly Ryzen desktop had a very strong holiday. We also started initial shipments on Ryzen mobile. And then, on the graphics side, we saw strength in all product lines. So, we saw strength in the channel for both gaming as well as blockchain; we saw strength in OEMs as we ramped Apple with our Vega processors; we also saw strength in professional graphics as we launched some GPU compute into the data centers. So, overall, those were the puts and takes. Semi-custom was down sequentially. And again, that\u2019s as expected, given the typical seasonality of the semi-custom business.","David Wong","Great, thanks. And Devinder, it might have been mentioned in your prepared remarks but do you expect your net debt will grow in the seasonally weak first half of 2018? And if so, how much might net debt go up?","Devinder Kumar","Net debt, when you say net debt, just explain that David, what do you mean by that?","David Wong","Well, debt minus cash; presumably, your cash balance is full during the first half of the year.","Devinder Kumar","The debt levels came down in 2017 because we did repurchase some of the long-term principal debt to the tune of $134 million; and in the guidance we provided, we said that 2018 would be free cash flow positive. So, if anything, I guess, the net debt, as you look at it, would come down as we get to the second half of 2018.","David Wong","But any hope in the first half, what happens to the net debt in the first half?","Devinder Kumar","Typically, we invest in the business. As you saw in the guidance, I expect inventory to be up in Q1. And obviously with the strength of the business momentum that Lisa just talked about, we\u2019re prepared to go ahead, purchase product or wafers to ahead and fund the business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Your line is now live.","Mark Lipacis","Thanks for taking my question. Lisa, I was hoping you could give us a little more color on EPYC. Are we starting to get past pilot programs now and getting deployed into production environments? Can you give us a sense of the take of EPYC in the cloud versus enterprise?","Dr. Lisa Su","Yeah, absolutely Mark. Look we are pleased with where we are with EPYC. We think we've made very nice progress in the fourth quarter. We announced that the large OEMs are now qualified and starting shift end customers. And so, we have seen some very nice design wins in sales at some marquee end customers. If you look across education, financial services and the hosting business, those are looking good. ","On the cloud side, we have publicly talked about Microsoft Azure as well as Baidu adopting EPYC in their cloud environments. We are working with a number of the other cloud players to adopt EPYC and we're working on some of the optimizations required there. ","So overall, we're very pleased with the momentum. I think we always knew that there was a qualification cycle that go through, but we've gotten through some of the major qualifications here in the fourth quarter. And especially as we look in December we actually closed a number of new deals with the platforms being available for sale.","Mark Lipacis","Thanks, that's helpful. and then on the C&G side, very impressive growth. Can you give us a sense of to what extent that growth was driven by Ryzen products versus Radeon? And then on the Radeon side, can you give us a sense of what block chain was to the contribution and how you're viewing the sustainability of that. It seems like it's getting consistently strong, so appreciate any updates on your view on that segment, thank you. ","Dr. Lisa Su","Yeah absolutely Mark. So, look on the Computing and Graphic segment, we grew about $140 million sequentially. And if I look at that growth, it was across Ryzen and Radeon. If you look at block chain in particular, our estimates are that it was about a third of the growth, a third of the $140 million. And then the rest of the two thirds are around the GPUs, the other segments of GPUs and Ryzen. ","When I look going forward, clearly, block chain is a little bit of a fluid and dynamic market. We did see some strength as we went into December. We see strength as we're going into the first quarter. I'm sure many of you have seen that the graphics channel is very low, and we're certainly working to replenish that channel environment. So, we think that graphics in general is going to be strong into the first half and that's some of what's contributing to our strong Q1 guidance. But overall, my comments are we're seeing nice momentum across Ryzen and all of the GPU segments which is important for us as we go into 2018 here. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your questions.","Stacy Rasgon","Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. My first is on gross margin, can you give us a feeling -- do you expect Q1 to be the trough for gross margins through the year, giving you are guiding in line to maybe a little above for the year the way you are guiding Q1. And can you give us some feeling on the puts and takes of gross margins as we go through the year particularly around particularly things around business mix, lower seasonality and lower growth on semicustom versus some of the new products for example?","Devinder Kumar","Yeah -- I can take then the Lisa maybe can add. As we start the year, as Lisa said, we do see momentum from the new products, the Ryzen, the GPUs and EPYC. And margin ends up on a sequential basis at the starting of the year 36%. We've previously said that for 2018 we expect margin to be greater than 36% so it is a good start of the year. Starting up well with a 36% guide. Obviously, the new products are having a benefit there. And then the one thing I will add from what Lisa said earlier in particular the semi-custom business timing is there is some incremental semi-custom revenue that gets recognized in Q1 as compared to the past from a timing and the year's standpoint. But overall, I think the 36% is really starting off in Q1 and very pleased with that. ","Stacy Rasgon","I would just say, so you do believe Q1 is probably a trough in terms of gross margins?","Dr. Lisa Su","Clearly Stacy, the first half of the year is usually the weaker half of our business, because we are a consumer led business, so as we -- we are starting off with 36% margin in Q1 is a good start. And we do expect that the new products will continue to ramp, as we go through 2018. So, I think that\u2019s how the puts and takes going forward. ","Stacy Rasgon","Thank you. So, my follow-up, I know your competitors saw some unusual strength in the enterprise markets and enterprise spending in Q4. I understand your exposure at this point, to those enterprise went to certainly less. What are you seeing in terms of our enterprise standpoint, are you seeing anything unusual or more or less sustainable in terms of strength versus what you would ordinarily expect to see this time of the year?","Dr. Lisa Su","Yeah Stacy, I think your question is about the market and our market share is still relatively low, so our exposure with EPYC, is there is a lot of activity. I mean there is a significant amount of activity with customers both in all segments cloud and enterprise, although I wouldn\u2019t say that that\u2019s necessarily a market trend, I would say that\u2019s more sort of where we are with our EPYC qualifications and ramp. And so, we don\u2019t see for example, we don\u2019t see that Q4 was especially strong and there will be a drop-off in Q1, in fact we expect that EPYC should grow as we go through Q1 and the rest of 2018. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong growth outlook. For my first one, just a clarification, I know it's been asked a few times. But what would your Q1 sales and a gross margin outlook have been under the older accounting methodology?","Devinder Kumar","Vivek, we are adopting the new revenue accounting standard under what is the full retrospective method, because we believe this is most helpful to the investors and for good measure, we have provided the Q1 2017 and Q4 2017 on a restated -- we have restated the revenue and obviously the Q1 2018 guidance under 606. We will probably restate the numbers, as part of the 10-K and from a Q1 2018 standpoint, if you look at the numbers, let\u2019s say you compare to Q4 2017 on a sequential basis, the revenues are up quarter-on-quarter and largely that's the trends for the new products in Q1 2018. ","Vivek Arya","Alright. I asked that, you are starting the year at a very strong 30% plus space and you\u2019re seeing double-digit growth for the year and double-digit is a very very wide range, so Lisa could you help at least get some level set of what double-digit growth means for the year?","Dr. Lisa Su","Yeah, so we are starting the year strong. I think maybe to give you a little bit more color on your question as it relates to the Q1 guidance. We are, as Devinder said, we are giving all guidance and forward-looking comments on 606. However, the largest impact particularly as it relates to revenue, is really sort of the semi-custom business. As you know, our custom business is a little bit unique because it\u2019s a singular customer. And so, under the new revenue recognition rules, we would actually take revenue with non-cashable POs. So that impact in the first quarter sort of guidance would have been about let's call it a 100 million or thereabouts. And so that might help you calibrate where we are. I think the -- anyway you look at it, the new product strength is the most important factor but we also want to be clear on what the accounting rule impact would be. Does that help you, Vivek?","Vivek Arya","Yes, Lisa very helpful. And for my follow-up, traditionally there has been a very large price delta between your and Intel products, sometime 50% to 60% plus in PCs and servers. As you look ahead with the new products, are you starting to see some of that price converge, like are you being positioned in segments where you\u2019ve not been previously so you can get the benefit of much better ASPs than you\u2019ve had historically?","Dr. Lisa Su","Yes, Vivek absolutely. So, if we look 2017 full year and look at our ASPs in the client business, the graphics business and the server business albeit fairly, we are definitely seeing a significant ASP expansion as a result of the fact that our products are now covering the higher end of the market. So, we are competing very well in the higher end of the market. I expect that there is still a delta but that delta is converging given our product coverage.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","John Pitzer","Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the strong results and thanks for letting me ask a question. Lisa, while the year-over-year gross margin improvement has been strong both in the calendar so the third quarter, fourth quarter and now on the guide in the first quarter, the sequential gross margin leverage is perhaps a little bit less than I would have thought, especially as you move into Q4 and Q1 and semi-custom comes down. ","Now I know there\u2019s been sort of a lag effect, as Ryzen grows as a percent of the mix. But maybe you can help me understand where we are as far as Ryzen as a percent of the mix being a positive influence on gross margin? ","And then just relative to your long-term gross margin target of 40 to 44, how far does Ryzen get you before you become more dependent on EPYC ramps later this year into 2019 and beyond?","Dr. Lisa Su","Sure. So, a lot of different questions their John. Let me try to unpack it there. So, let\u2019s talk about sort of Ryzen and sort of the margin both Q4 and Q1. On the Ryzen, to give you sort of a flavor of where we are in terms of the new product ramp, Ryzen Q4 was probably in the high 40s percentage of our overall client business and we expect that that will be over 50% starting in the first quarter of 2018. And so, that ramp definitely helps and its part of our sequential 100 basis point improvement from Q4 to Q1.","I think in terms of overall new product revenues, if you take Ryzen, EPYC and then our new graphics products in totality, in Q4 they were about 33% of our revenue and we expect that to ramp nicely as we go into 2018. So, I think we are getting the margin leverage. The margin leverage certainly from Q4 to Q1 is due to the fact that we have strong products. And the thing that\u2019s a little bit different this quarter is because we are guiding under 606. And as a result of that, semi-custom which is typically seasonally down Q4 to Q1 in this case is actually up a little bit Q4 to Q1. And so that's a headwind on the margin, but overall, we're still up a 100 basis points. So that kinds of gets to the gist of your question?","John Pitzer","No, that's helpful Lisa. And then maybe a second question just on the OpEx. Revenue for the calendar first quarter significantly above where the street was expecting, but still was OpEx. And I'm curious is there any sort of unusual expenses around spectre or meltdown that's going on? And then to continue that for the full year, you're guiding OpEx about in line with your long-term target. So, is there opportunity that's your long-term target can come down and maybe 28% of revenue on OpEx comes down overtime or how should we think about that leverage?","Dr. Lisa Su","Yeah. So, look, so relative to OpEx, I think our long-term guidance was 26% to 30%. Calendar year of 2017, we were roughly approximately 30% if you look at it for the full year basis. We're guiding 2018 to approximately 28%, so we're starting to see some of that leverage. Granted we're starting off in Q1 which is usually a low quarter for us. And then as we go forward, we are certainly looking at more leverage in the model, but we are investing in sort of the key new products, we are investing in software. And I think that's absolutely the right thing for us to do. ","As it relates to any unusual expenses with spectre and meltdown, there are no particular unusual expenses related to that. I think what we are doing is we're investing in the business. We believe strongly in the product roadmap that we have and given the significant revenue growth we believe we can afford to invest in the business. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. ","Joseph Moore","Great thank you. I'm wondering if you talk a little bit about product that you've announced with the Intel over the course of Q4 the semicustom graphics products. I guess interesting to see few companies working together. Can you put that product into context versus other things you could do going forward, and then just is that going to be in the semicustom part of revenues or in the compute part? Thank you. ","Dr. Lisa Su","Sure Joe. So, the product that we announced with Intel was semicustom graphics products. So, what we're doing is we're selling silicon to them and then they are packaging in a multistrip module and they're marketing it and selling to end customers. From my standing, this is an excellent way to get more Radeon GPUs in as many applications as possible. And so, our strategy is we'll build our own standard products, we will build custom products for customers. And then look for how do we get Radeon in as many places as possible. For this graphics revenue becomes very similar to discrete graphics, we're actually reporting it in the Computing and Graphics segment. And we did see some initial revenue from that in Q4. But it is as I said it's a semicustom chip that is sold to them to be packaged with their products. ","Operator","Thank you. Certainly, our next question is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live.","Ross Seymore","Thanks Lisa, one for you back on the put the side of things. It was great to see the incremental color that you gave. But is there any way that you could give an absolute dollar amount of whether it be in the fourth quarter or just full year '17 on what you believe crypto contributed to your revenues?","Dr. Lisa Su","Yeah absolutely Ross. So, it is hard to estimate. I think we said before, it's hard to estimate just given some of the crypto sort of GPUs are sold through the same channels as our gaming channel. I previously said, we thought it was about mid-single digit percentage of our annual revenue, it maybe a little bit higher than that, let's call it a point or so, but it's really a lot of our growth is outside of the blockchain market. ","What we see in the market though, is because I know there is a lot of conversation about this, in the market, it is an important market, I mean we are now seeing it from the standpoint of there is a lot of dynamic movement in the market, but it is consuming lot of GPUs, it\u2019s a good part of our business and we intend to sort of work with the large players to better forecast that business going forward. But I don\u2019t want that to take away from the fact that we had significant growth in the GPU business outside of blockchain, as we really ramp our Vega product line, we just ramped our GPU compute product line, as we ramped Apple, and so those are all important pieces of our GPU story. ","Ross Seymore","Perfect that\u2019s helpful. As my follow-up, I wanted to go back to, stating you said in answering a prior question about the Semi-Custom business being up sequentially and then saying, it was about a $100 million benefit. Is that up sequentially, you are talking about relative to the fourth quarter, pre or post the ASC adjustment, just trying to tie these all together and kind of get the moving parts behind your guidance because it is much higher than I think where many of us expected it to be?","Dr. Lisa Su","Yeah, so let me try and Devinder may keep me -- make sure that we\u2019re clear here. So, the $100 million that I referenced was relative to the Q1 2017 adjustments, which was approximately $200 million or so. If you look at it on a sequential basis, it won\u2019t be up a $100 million, it will be up somewhat less than that, but typically we\u2019re quite -- we are down quite a bit in Semi-Custom, and so it is a different seasonal pattern that we would normally see. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Brett Simpson from Arete Research. Your line is now live. ","Brett Simpson","Yeah, thanks very much. I just had a question on crypto, I mean if I look at the amount of hash compute being added to Ethereum in January I mean it's more than the whole of Q4, so we have seen a big start to the Q1. So, I am just wondering, what\u2019s the balance or the sort of mix in your C&G division between GPU and CPU sort of looking at Q4 and how it changed the Q1. And is there any sort of acute shortages here, I man can your foundry partners do they have the capacity to support you with a ramp of GPUs at the moment and is there enough HBM2 DRAM to source as well? thank you. ","Dr. Lisa Su","Yeah, right. So, in relation to your question about client and graphics, look both the client business and the graphics business grew sequentially in Q4, so both of them were strong businesses for us and as I said there are -- crypto was one driver, but there were numerous other drivers as well. ","Relative to just where we are in the market today, for sure the GPU channel is lower than we would like it to be, so we are ramping up our production. At this point we are not limited by silicon per se, so our foundry partners are supplying us, there are shortages in memory and I think that is true across the board, whether you are talking about GDDR5, or you\u2019re talking about high bandwidth memory. We continue to work through that, with our memory partners and that will be certainly one of the key factors as we go through 2018. ","Brett Simpson","Okay thanks very much. And just a follow-up on 7-nanometer, I mean a lot being talked about 7 with TSMC ramping fairly shortly and also Intel being perhaps a little delayed on 10 nanometers. Can you talk about what your plans are for 7 nanometers in 2018, can you ship a CPU platform based on 7 nanometer this year or is there -- are you also seeing some delays in 7 with your foundry partners?","Dr. Lisa Su","So relative to 7, 7 is a very important node for us. We are doing very active developments in the 7 across our GPU and our CPU portfolios. Relative to shipment date, I will until we get closer to production before we talk about that. But what we have said is that we will sample a GPU here in 2018, targeted machine learning and that will be in 7 nanometer technologies. And we are also actively working on CPU products in the 7-nanometer technology as well.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Tristan Gerra from Baird. Your line is now live.","Tristan Gerra","Hi. Good afternoon. You\u2019ve mentioned that you expect very strong demand from blockchain in the first half. How aggressive are you in terms of embedding that type of trend in your Q1 guidance? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of the contribution from that segment in your Q1 guidance? And also, is the margin profile immediate from the rest of your GPU business?","Dr. Lisa Su","So, I think as we said on the Q1 guidance it is really strength across our new products. So, it\u2019s not just the blockchain or crypto conversation, that\u2019s one factor. But we do see strength across the rest of our GPU business as well as CPU business with Ryzen and EPYC. So of course, we take into account what we believe the demand will be here in the first quarter and we think we\u2019re fairly balanced with that. And overall given the current lead times I think we have good visibility into what the order pattern and so on and so forth. So, I think the key point is crypto is strong right now but we do believe that it is a very dynamic environment and so we have to watch that very closely and our numerous other product drivers in our Q1 guidance including the CPU business which is an important driver.","Tristan Gerra","Okay. And as a quick follow up. In terms of the ramp of EPYC, should we look at a kind linear ramp throughout this year or is there more of any inflection point at any given time that you would expect or any given quarter that you would expect this year?","Dr. Lisa Su","I do expect that steady ramp of EPYC as we go through the year. Our target is to be at mid-single-digit unit share by the end of 2018. And so, there would be significant revenue from EPYC as we are in the second half of \u201818. But certainly, we\u2019d expect a steady ramp throughout the year.","Operator","Certainly. Our next question is coming from Srini Pajjuri from Macquarie. Your line is now live.","Srini Pajjuri","Thank you for squeezing me in. Just a couple clarifications. First, I guess, Devinder, the accounting change you kind of gave as an explanation how the season, how it works for Q1. I am just curious as to how your seasonality changes as we go into Q2, Q3, and Q4? But historically you\u2019re down in Q1 and kind of flattish in Q2 and then up in Q3 and Q4. So just trying to understand how the accounting change impacts the seasonality?","Devinder Kumar","Yes, I think the more significant change is from our semi-custom where you are going to see acceleration of revenue in the first half as opposed to where it used to be later towards the second half of the year. And that is the timing issue within the annually there is not much impact. It's really immaterial from that standpoint. But timing wise you'll see that [indiscernible] revenue earlier in Q1 and Q2 and then obviously you still have it in Q3 and Q4. So, seasonality when semicustom business changes as Lisa said earlier, typically Q4 to Q1 is down and now Q4 to Q1 is up. ","Dr. Lisa Su","But I would add though just for that seasonality question. I think what you'll see is perhaps a little bit of flatter profile. We used to have a very high peak in Q3. And now I think you'll see a little bit of a flatter profile with sort of second quarter still be higher than first quarter third quarter higher than second quarter. And then fourth quarter we would expect to be down. ","Srini Pajjuri","Great. And then Lisa, just another clarification on Ryzen. Obviously, you're seeing very strong ramps. I would have expected you to see a little bit of ASP benefit in Q4, but looks like ASPs came in flattish. I'm just curious as to why they're only flat not up sequentially?","Dr. Lisa Su","Yeah sure. So, I think when you look at the ASPs it's very dependent on the actual mix. And so underneath the client ASPs we actually saw desktop a little bit lower. And that's because the desktop sales in the holiday season were a little bit more weighted to Ryzen 3 which has a lower ASP than some of the Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7. But we actually saw mobile ASPs up because we saw the beginning of the shipments of Ryzen mobile which pulled ASPs up. So, it's just the detailed mix of the business. But overall, I think we saw very strong growth. ","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today coming from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Your line is now live. ","Ambrish Srivastava","Hi thank you very much. I just had a question on free cash flow since I trust you so much on that. Good to see a solid quarter on that front. But my question really is, you've guided for an increase in free cash flow for next year. Should we expect the same kind of dynamic that you've had this year seasonality in Q4? And then also you have to build up working capital and inventory specifically because of the dynamics on memory and the tightness earlier in the year. So, what are some of the puts and takes there if you could please help us with that? Thank you.","Devinder Kumar","I think it's a rightly observed. I mean our strong quarter from an overall standpoint where cash is concerned and cash from upgrades are very strong in Q4 and free cash flow was $339 million ending at the $1.18 billion. There is typically pressure on cash in the first half of the year just given the fact that the revenue is then by the wafers to support the business and then it gets better in the second half of the year. ","As far as working capital is concerned it's a little bit early to tell. I think it depends upon how the revenue unfolds. Obviously, we have managed it pretty well, but supporting the higher revenue from the stand [ph] of the business is going to be the key from that standpoint. But to your points, I do feel very good as to where the cash ended up. I do feel very good about how we have done from a managing the balance sheet for working capital and the debt levels. And 2018 we are guiding to free cash flow being positive for the year. ","Ambrish Srivastava","Okay. And a quick follow up for you Lisa. If you look at the double-digit growth for this year, what are the absolute dollar drivers in terms of which product categories do you expect within EPYC GPU machine learning or for Ryzen? If you were to rank order those in terms of absolute dollar impact this year.","Dr. Lisa Su","Yeah so if I were to rank order those, I would say that both Epic and Ryzen as we deployed Ryzen more into the notebook form factor which very significant OE ramp, are very keen for that. I think CPUs and machine learning are also a strong growth driver for us, but just given sort of where we are from the base that we are starting with, I think the other two are just more significant.

And welcome to AMD's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018 conference call. By now, you should have had the opportunity to review a copy of our earnings release and slides. If you have not reviewed these documents, they can be found on the Investor Relations page of AMD's Web site, www.amd.com.","Participants on today's conference call are Dr. Lisa Su, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Devinder Kumar, our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer. This is a live call, and will be replayed via webcast on our Web site.","I would like to highlight some important dates for you; Dr. Lisa Su will present at the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference on Tuesday, February 12; also, Ruth Cotter, Senior Vice President of HR, Worldwide Marketing and Investor Relations will present at the Susquehanna Annual Technology Conference on Tuesday March 12; and our 2019 first quarter quiet time will begin at the close of business on Friday March 15, 2019.","Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We will refer primarily to non-GAAP financial measures during this call except for revenue, gross margin and segment operational results, which are reported on a GAAP basis.

You will also find detailed discussions about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC and in particular, AMD's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 29, 2018.","Now, with that, I will hand the call over to Lisa. Lisa?","Lisa Su","Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. 2018 marked another year of strong financial performance, driven by our expanded high performance product portfolio despite near-term graphics weakness. We grew annual revenue by 23% with Ryzen, EPYC and datacenter GPUs product revenue growing by more than $1.2 billion for the year. Our new products gained share and significantly expanded gross margin, leading to our most profitable year since 2011.","Looking at the fourth quarter, revenue of $1.42 billion increased 6% from a year ago with approximately 65% of sales coming from our new products. We reached an important milestone in our business in the quarter as our high margin datacenter CPUs and GPUs accounted for a mid-teens percentage of overall revenue. While we expect our data center revenues to be lumpy, the ramp of our data center business is beginning to contribute meaningfully to our financial results.","Looking at our computing and graphics segments, we delivered our eighth straight quarter of year-over-year segment revenue growth. Sales of Ryzen desktop and notebook processors and datacenter GPUs offset lower GPU sales as the channel continued working through elevated levels of graphics inventory. Client processor unit shipments grew by more than 50% from the year ago period. We had our highest client computing revenue in more than four years, and we believe we gain client CPU unit share for the fifth straight quarter.","At CES, Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Huawei, Lenovo and Samsung, all launched notebooks powered by our new second generation Ryzen mobile processor with Radeon data graphics. The second gen Ryzen mobile processor delivers more performance, enhanced features and longer battery life than any mobile processor we have ever built, and is the fastest processor available for ultrathin notebooks.","The industry's first AMD based Chromebooks launched earlier this quarter from Acer and HP. We expect additional AMD based Chromebooks to launch later this year as we expand our participation in this growing portion of the PC market. Based on the competitive positioning of our Ryzen processors, we expect the number of Ryzen systems that will launched in 2019 to increase by more than 30% in 2018 with the number of Ryzen notebook systems planned to launch increasing by more than 50%.","In graphics, GPU revenue decreased year-over-year, driven largely by lower channel GPU and memory sales, partially offset by a significant increase in data center GPU sales. We saw an improvement in channel GPU sell out throughout the quarter as our partners continued to drain their inventories. There is still more work to do, but we remain confident and we're taking the right actions to further reduce channel inventory. We set a record for professional GPU revenue in the quarter, driven by multiple high volume wins for our Vega based data centers GPUs. We started shipping our new 7-nanometer Radeon Instinct accelerators in the quarter and introduced a major set of enhancements to our data center GPU software that make it easier for customers to deploy Radeon GPUs for AI and machine learning workloads.","At CES, we highlighted the significant gain in momentum we're generating for Radeon across consoles, PCs and the cloud. For gamers and creators, we announced our return to the high end GPU market with the new Radeon VII GPU. Powered by our second generation Vega graphics core and featuring 16 gigabytes of second generation high bandwidth memory, our new 7-nanometer Radeon VII GPU delivers leadership performance in content creation and compute workloads and is very competitively positioned when running the most demanding AAA games at 4k resolution.","In cloud gaming, we announced that Google selected Radeon Pro GPUs to power their game streaming initiative, Project Stream. The performance and differentiated virtualization features of our Radeon Pro GPUs enable Google to deliver an uncompromised High Definition gaming experience on virtually any PC.","Turning to our enterprise embedded in semicustom segment, revenue was flat from a year ago as a double-digit percentage decrease in semicustom revenue was offset by strong growth in EPYC processor sales. As expected, semicustom sales were down from a year ago based on where we are in the current console cycle. This console generation remains one of the most successful ever as Microsoft and Sony combined have now shipped well in excess of 120 million AMD powered consoles.","Fourth quarter server unit shipments more than doubled sequentially based on growing demand for our highest end 32 core EPYC processors with cloud, HPC and virtualized enterprise customers. As a result, we believe we achieved our goal of mid-single-digit server unit share exiting 2018. We had another strong quarter of cloud adoption, highlighted by industry leader Amazon announcing new versions of their most popular EC2 computing instances powered by EPYC processors. Businesses can easily migrate their AWS instances to AMD and save 10% or more based on the technology advantages of our platform.","Microsoft Azure also announced general availability of their AMD based storage instance in the quarter, as well as a new HPC instance powered by EPYC processors that is 33% faster than competitive x86 offerings. We secured multiple HPC wins in the quarter, including Procter and Gamble, the U.S. Department of Energy and one of Europe's largest supercomputers at the University of Stuttgart's High-Performance Computing Center. Lawrence Livermore Labs also announced a new supercomputer, featuring both EPYC processors and Radeon Instinct accelerators that will be used for machine learning and big data analytics workloads.","Customer interest in our next generation Rome server processor remains very high. Rome is expected to deliver four times the floating point performance and double the compute performance for socket compared to our current generation EPYC processors. We probably demonstrated a single 64 core next generation EPYC processor outperforming two of our competitors' highest end server processors in multiple workloads. Rome development is proceeding very well and we are on track to start shipments midyear.","I am also pleased to report that we concluded discussions with GlobalFoundries on the seventh amendment to our Wafer Supply Agreement. The amendment affirms the strategic partnership with GF for products built at 12 nanometers and above, and provide AMD with full sourcing flexibility at the 7-nanometer and below nodes. GF continues to be a critical supplier of AMD's current generation products and will play a key role in our next generation Ryzen and EPYC products with our chiplet strategy.","In summary, 2018 was another strong year for AMD. Increased adoption of our high performance products drove a second straight year of double-digit annual revenue growth, expanded gross margins and improved profitability. I would like to thank the more than 10,000 AMD employees whose dedication with building great products have made these results possible. While headwinds remain in the graphics channel and macro uncertainties are causing some caution in the first half of 2019, we believe we are well positioned to gain share throughout the year and accelerate growth as we ramp our next generation 7 nanometer products. As we entered 2019, we are preparing to launch our strongest product portfolio ever. In gaming, we will launch our high end Radeon 7 GPU in February, followed by our next generation Navi GPUs later in the year.","In client computing, we started the year with our second generation Ryzen mobile processors and we\u2019re on track to launch our third generation Ryzen desktop processors in the middle of the year. And in the server market, we expect to deliver a significant step function performance increase with the launch of our next generation Rome processors in the middle of the year. I am very proud of what we accomplished in 2018 and even more excited about how our long-term investments are set to pay off in 2019.","Now, I would like to turn the call over Devinder to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter and full year financial performance. Devinder?","Devinder Kumar","Thank you, Lisa and good afternoon everyone. 2018 was a strong year for AMD. New product introductions drove the highest annual revenue since 2011, and a significant improvement in gross margin year-over-year.","Earnings per share increased from $0.10 per share in 2017 to $0.46 per share in 2018. Full year 2018 revenue was $6.48 billion, up 23% year-on-year, driven by strong performance in the computing and graphics segment with significant growth in Ryzen processor sales. Although, there was weakness in the graphics channel in the second half of the year, we saw strength in data center CPUs and GPUs.","Gross margin was 39%, up 440 basis points from the prior year. Gross margin improvements were primarily driven by our new Ryzen, EPYC and Radeon products. Operating expenses were 29% of revenue, an improvement of 2 percentage points from the prior year. For the full year, operating income was $633 million, up $409 million from $224 million in the prior year. Net income was $514 million, up $411 million compared to net income of $103 million in the prior year. On the balance sheet, we reduced principal debt by $171 million and improved gross leverage significantly from 4.6 times a year ago to 1.9 times at the end of 2018.","Let me turn to the details of the fourth quarter results, fourth quarter revenue, gross margin, operating margin and earnings per share all improved year-over-year. Quarterly revenue of $1.42 billion was up 6% from a year ago. Strong sales of Ryzen and EPYC processors and data center GPUs more than offset lower channel GPU and semicustom sales during the quarter. Fourth quarter 2018 revenue did not include any IP-related revenue and Blockchain-related GPU revenue was negligible.","Gross margin was 41%, up 740 basis points from 34% a year ago. Year-on-year gross margin improvement was driven primarily by the ramp of Ryzen and EPYC processor sales. Gross margin has increased year-over-year for seven consecutive quarters, driven by a higher percentage of revenue from new products. Fourth quarter 2018 gross margin excludes a $45 million write-down of older technology licenses that are no longer being used. Operating expenses grew 9% year-over-year to $474 million and remained approximately flat as a percentage of revenue from the year ago period. We continued to invest in our product roadmap and go to market activities as we gain market share in important markets.","Operating income was $109 million, up $90 million from $19 million a year ago. Operating margin was 8%, up from less than 2% last year. Net income was $87 million compared to $8 million a year ago. Q4 2018 net income excludes of withholding tax refund plus interest of $43 million related to an IP litigation settlement from 2010. Diluted earnings per share using a diluted share count of $1.180 billion was $0.08 per share compared to $0.01 per share a year ago.","Now turning to the business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $986 million, up 9% year-over-year. Revenue growth was driven primarily by continued strong Ryzen desktop product sales and the adoption of second generation Ryzen mobile processors, largely offset by lower channel GPU and memory sales compared to the prior year. Ryzen products continued to ramp and was greater than 80% of total client revenue, driven by OEM and channel momentum. In Graphics, sales were down year-over-year due to negligible Blockchain related revenue in the fourth quarter of 2018, as well as elevated levels of Graphics inventory in the channel. Total Graphics revenue grew sequentially, driven by strong Radeon datacenter GPU sales.","Computing and Graphics' operating segment income was $115 million compared to $33 million a year ago. The increase was driven primarily by strength in Ryzen product sales and significantly higher ASPs in both desktop and mobile compared to a year ago. Enterprise embedded and semi-custom revenue was $433 million, flat from the prior year. Server revenue growth was offset by lower semi-custom revenue. EPYC cost of units more than doubled sequentially, driving significant growth in datacenter revenue in the quarter. EESC segment operating loss was $6 million compared to a loss of $13 million a year ago. The improvement due to higher EPYC cross-sell revenue was partially offset by lower semi-custom revenue and continued engineering and go-to-market investments in the server business.","Turning to the balance sheet, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.16 billion at the end of the quarter. We generated free cash flow of $79 million in the quarter. Free cash flow was a negative $129 million for the full year, primarily due to growth in inventory related to new products and the timing of collections. Inventory was $845 million, up $107 million sequentially, primarily due to the ramp of new products. Total principle debt was $1.5 billion as we further reduce term debt by $60 million during the quarter, resulting in total debt reduction of $171 million during 2018.","We expect to pay off the remaining $66 million of 2019 term debt in March 2019, and beyond that there are no long-term debt maturities until 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $152 million compared to $58 million years ago. And on a trailing 12 month basis, adjusted EBITDA was $803 million, more than doubling year-over-year. Gross leverage was 1.9 times as we ended 2018 and we are pleased to have achieved our long-term gross leverage target of less than 2 times.","Before turning to our financial outlook, let me discuss our Wafer Supply Agreement with GlobalFoundaries. Today, seven amendment of the WSA spans on January 2019 through March 2024. It establishes purchase commitments and pricing at 12-nanometer and above for the years 2019 through 2021. The amendment also provides AMD full sourcing flexibility at 7-nanometer and beyond without any one-time payments or royalties for products, purchase from other foundries.","Turning to the outlook for the first quarter of 2019, we expect revenue to be approximately $1.25 billion plus or minus $50 million, a decrease of approximately 12% sequentially, and 24% year-over-year. Sequentially, the decrease is expected to be primarily driven by continued softness in the graphics channel and seasonality across the business. The year-over-year decrease is expected to be primarily driven by lower graphic sales due to excess channel inventory, the absence of Blockchain later GPU revenue and lower memory sales.","In addition, semi custom revenue is expected to be lower year-over-year, while Ryzen, EPYC and Radeon datacenter GPU product sales are expected to increase. In addition for Q1, 2019, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 41%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $480 million, non-GAAP interest expense taxes and other to be approximately $25 million and we also expect to record $60 million IP licensing gain associated with the static JV in the first quarter of 2019, which will be a benefit to operating income and recorded on the licensing gain line of the P&L.","For the full year 2019 despite near-term business in the graphics channel and a cautious macro environment, we expect high-single-digit percentage revenue growth, driven by Ryzen, EPYC and Radeon and datacenter GPU product sales and as we ramp our 7-nanometer products throughout the year. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be greater than 41%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 29% of revenue and a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 4% of pre-tax income.","In closing, we made excellent progress in 2018. We grew the top-line by more than $1.2 billion, expanded gross margin and significantly improved profitability. We continue to execute our long-term financial model, driven by our new high performance computing products that gained solid momentum last year. We are pleased to enter 2019 with a strengthened balance sheet and a strong portfolio of next generation products capable of driving continued financial growth.","With that, I'll turn it back to Laura for the question and answer session. Laura.","Laura Graves","Thank you, Devinder. Operator, we're ready for our first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. You're line is now live.","Toshiya Hari","Lisa, I had a question on your full year 2019 outlook. You guys are guiding revenue growth in the high-single-digit range. Embedded in that outlook, what growth rates are you assuming for your core businesses computing, graphics, semicustom and server CPUs? And then on the gross margin side, 41% or greater. Is the improvement year-over-year primarily a function of revenue growth in mix or is the amendment in the WSA playing a role there as well? Thank you.","Lisa Su","So relative to the full year guidance of up high-single-digits, the primary growth drivers are Ryzen and EPYC or the two largest growth drivers with datacenter GPU. Also, we're expecting that to be up. And then we would expect that semicustom will be down. If you look at life cycle of semicustom will be in the seventh year of the console cycle. And so we expect semicustom would be down approximately 20% and then we would expect consumer graphics to also be down let's call it double-digits as we really burn off some of the channel inventory that we see in the first half of the year. So Ryzen and EPYC are the largest drivers of the growth, and that\u2019s as we launch our 7-nanometer products throughout the year. And then your second question, Tosh, was\u2026","Toshiya Hari","Yes, gross margins 41% or greater that's a 2 percentage point or greater improvement year-over-year. Is that primarily a function of revenue growth and improvement in mix given Ryzen and EPYC, or is the WSA amendment providing a tailwind as well?","Lisa Su","Yes, it's primarily due to the mix. So the mix of the higher margin new products Ryzen, EPYC and the datacenter GPUs.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Matt Ramsay from Cowen & Company. Your line is now live.","MattRamsay","Lisa, I guess I wanted to attack Tosh's question on the full year a little bit differently. And maybe just talk about a little bit what share gain assumptions you guys are embedding for your 7 nanometer roadmap versus maybe some pragmatism or conservatism on the market. Just given the macro? I mean Intel talked about a flat PC TAM in terms of units and obviously is only I guess guided us to mid single-digit growth for their expansive server business for the year. And you guys are starting off down maybe 25% year-over-year in revenue for the first quarter given what's going on in the graphics business. So maybe you could just walk us through a little bit what you're thinking about the TAM growth of your two main growth markets for the year versus share gains you're embedding? Thank you.","Lisa Su","I think as it relates to the market, I don\u2019t think we would have a very different view of the market as others may have stated. Our story really is a share gain story. And when you take a look at the progress that we've made in 2018 in the design wins that we have in 2018. As we go over the 2019 when we look at both Rome as well as Ryzen, we look at the breath of OEM platforms that we have, the customer engagements by workloads and how we see that progressing. We feel very good about the opportunity to gain share as we go through the year, particularly given how competitive the product set is. Similarly on the PC side, we've made nice progress over the last four or five quarters on Ryzen. We started strong on desktop. And then the last couple of quarters, we've made good progress on notebook. We see a broader portfolio with our OEMs as we go into 2019 and we also see a more competitive desktop product line as well as notebook product line. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about the year.","To your point about starting a little bit with lower guidance in Q1, I think that\u2019s true. When we look at Q1, particularly on a year-over-year basis, there are lot of moving pieces but it's primarily due to the graphics channel. And that\u2019s both the reduced demand, as well as the absence in Blockchain revenue on a year-over-year basis, as well as the semi custom business. But as we move forward, as we go into Q2 and beyond, we see a significant opportunity with the ramp of our new products and that\u2019s how we see the year.","MattRamsay","Devinder, maybe just a couple of little things in terms of licensing gains and IP revenue, I got asked a few times and my associates want to clarify here that the gross margin outlook for the first quarter does not include any IP or licensing gains. And then for the full year, are you including any IP revenue in the revenue outlook? And how should we think about the rest of the Thatic licensing gains apply to timing for when those might get recognized? I know it\u2019s a lot there, but lots of question on just the moving pieces there. Thank you.","Devinder Kumar","License gain essentially does not impact gross margin, that's on a separate line all together on the license and gain line of the P&L. So the gross margin is not impacted by that. As far as IP revenues is concerned in Q1 there is no contemplated IP revenue, so the gross margin at 41% guide is based on the products that we have. And for the year at this point outside of the Thatic JV IP licensing gain that we are expecting to record in Q1, while there might be opportunities from an IP standpoint, but nothing substantial contemplated at this point.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is live.","Vivek Arya","Lisa, I'm curious as you look back at 2019 and the success you had with EPYC, the initial success with EPYC, what was the mix of cloud versus enterprise? And then how do you think it trends in 2019, because of all the concerns around slowdown in cloud CapEx and so forth. And as part of that, if you could share with us what your market share assumptions are as we exit the year on EPYC?","Lisa Su","So as we look through 2018, we were pretty pleased with our progress on EPYC. And coming off of the fourth quarter, actually it was a fairly strong fourth quarter for us and in fact that we doubled the number of units for our server business. And when you look at that mix, it is more cloud weighted. So we had some large deployments that went online here in the fourth quarter and that was positive for us. That being said that we\u2019re making nice progress in the enterprise and HPC side of the business too. We've had a number of wins in the quarter, as well as going into 2019.","So as we look into 2019, I would expect that the early Rome deployments will also be cloud based. It will be the first ones, but we have a strong set of enterprise platforms. And as I mentioned earlier it\u2019s the breadth of the OEM platforms that gives us good confidence that we were going to a broader set of workloads and having broader coverage in the market. In terms of share assumptions we will have to see how the markets and year play out. But I think what we've said before is that after reaching the mid-single digit market share in the fourth quarter of 2018, we would expect it would take another four to six quarters to reach 10% market share. And I think we're still in that range.","Vivek Arya","And for my follow up, there were two things that came out on your competitors last few public discussions, which is one this concept of CPU shortages. And I\u2019m wondering if that has had any positive or negative effect on your strategy or positioning? And then Intel has also mentioned being a little more tactical when it comes to pricing. And I\u2019m wondering how that figures into your full year outlook. So both the impact of CPU shortages and pricing, any color would be very helpful. Thank you.","Lisa Su","On the CPU shortages, my comment is that there are some pockets of shortage, particularly at low end. However, our focus has really been on ramping Ryzen. And if you look at the Ryzen percentage of our overall business, Ryzen Devinder mentioned was 80% of our client business. So we are really actually improving our mix in the client business. I think that, again from my view, the shortages are temporary but we look at it as really getting consistent share gain. And as we've gone through each quarter in 2018, we've seen consistent share gain and we believe we gain share in the fourth quarter as well. So I think we are well positioned with the portfolio and we will certainly drive that into 2019.","And then relative to pricing, when we think about pricing and when we put together our long-term model, we have factored in that pricing and competition will be aggressive. I think we know that to be the case. What we've seen in the market is consistent with that. But we also believe that particularly as you go into the datacenter, the single largest factor from a buying decision standpoint is the performance and the total cost of ownership of the product. And we believe that Rome will be very, very well positioned in 2019. And so we are cognizant of the competitive environment but feel good that we have the right set of assumptions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Your line is now live.","Mark Lipacis","Thanks for taking my question and great to hit the mid-single digit milestone exiting the year. Lisa, as you start -- I just wanted to confirm, you expect to start shipping Rome mid-year. And as you do, what's the biggest risk for Rome? Is it execution on delivering the product, or is it the sales process convincing customers to take EPYC to in volume?","Lisa Su","So I think with Rome, our biggest opportunity\/risk is adoption rate. I think from a competitive standpoint, the product is very solid, everything going through our development labs looks very good, as well as our customer engagements. And so this is just about getting customers to production as fast as possible. We do expect though that the adoption rate for Rome will be faster than the adoption rate for Naples. And the reason for that is we are in a socket compatible infrastructure. And so customers who don't necessarily need the newest features of the platform can actually use the same motherboard and system that they currently have with Naples and drop in Rome. And so I think that will help us accelerate some of the adoption. But right now, it's about helping customers in their environment. We are widely sampling Rome and there's a lot of work to be done but we feel good about the trajectory.","Mark Lipacis","And a follow up if I may for Devinder. So inventories, looks like they were up about $100 million going into a pretty healthy seasonal quarter that's declining. How should we read that Devinder? And was there just some opportunity to get some wafers more cheaply? Or are you trying to stockpile product in front of launches? And when can we expect that inventory to be a source of cash on the cash flow statement? Thank you.","Devinder Kumar","So the inventory growth is primarily driven by our new products and in preparation for the 7 nanometer next generation product launches later this year as you just mentioned. We overall expect to manage our environment revenue, but also in support of the new products that will be launching ramping throughout the year. Lisa mentioned a few of the launches at CES and also in the script. And we prepared to support that from an inventory standpoint and we'll see how the year progresses and then manage it from there.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Stacey Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is now live.","Stacy Rasgon","Around the Q1 guide, obviously, you mentioned the GPU weakness but you also mentioned seasonality across the businesses. Is my assumption correct that that means everything is basically down sequentially CPUs, GPUs, Servers? And can tell us is that true? And if so can you give us an idea of the magnitude like what is down most versus least sequentially, Ryzen versus GPU versus EPYC?","Lisa Su","So the largest driver as I said is the GPU channel situation on a year-over-year basis. On a sequential basis, typical seasonality for let's call it PCs and GPUs and datacenter is probably around 10% or so. We are forecasting or we believe that that will be a little bit -- down a little bit more than that. And in terms of the ranking, I would say GPUs are down a bit more than the other two segments that's the way we currently see it.","Stacy Rasgon","For my follow-up, I had a question just in general EESC. So its revenues are flat year-over-year. The server revenues are up a bunch and still losing money. And I get it there's some incremental investments and everything. But I guess how do we think about the profitability of that segment? How big does EPYC or Rome in the server business maybe to get before it sustainably profitable, especially semi custom has going to continue to decline 20% in 2019?","Devinder Kumar","I think the key, Stacy, is going to be ramping the server business in 2019. You are right that year-over-year we look at it, it's lost little bit of money. But fundamentally, it's investing in the go-to-market programs and launching the new products, investing in the ongoing engineering work that's needed to make sure that customers bring up the product on time. And semi custom, given the fact that is in the seventh year of the cycle, we expect it to be down from 2018 to 2019. But we do expect to go ahead and ramp of our server business and that will definitely benefit the EESC profitability in 2019.","Stacy Rasgon","Do you think it's profitable for the full year?","Devinder Kumar","Too early to tell, I don't predict profitability at the segment level. But we'll see how it evolves over the year.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live.","Ross Seymore","Lisa, a potentially different way to ask the same question on the full year 2019 guide. Late last year at a few different events, you talked about the server business being second half weighted. If I go through the remainder of this year, it seems like you have to grow better part of 20% plus sequentially in each quarter to get there. I know it's not going to be perfectly linear like that. But I guess my overall question is if the server side of the business is back half weighted. What sorts of businesses are helping the middle portion of the year? Is there some snapback on the GPU side? Is there something going on on the Ryzen side? Just trying to get somewhat of the shape of the year off of a base that's admittedly pretty low as your first quarter starting point?","Lisa Su","So I think it is fair to say that our quarterly progression will have a lot to do with our product launches. So you would expect that server will be more second half weighted than first half. In general, our business is more second half weighted though if you think about the consumer portions of our business. But think about it as we would expect sequential growth in PCs, we would certainly expect sequential growth in datacenter, although stronger in the second half. We're also as we see the GPU business right now, we see the first quarter as the low point in the business with the channel getting improving as we go into the second quarter. And we have additional product launches there as well. So that's the way we would see the portfolio. And semi custom, although it's lower on a year-over-year basis, we would expect it to also increase as we go from second quarter into third quarter as well.","Ross Seymore","And then a question on the GPU side, your big competitor in that market obviously is having some current issues and mentioned that the new product at the high-end wasn\u2019t selling through. Are you at all concerned that the competitive landscape in that market, whether it's because China demand being weaker as they cited or them having to be a little bit more aggressive on pricing would do anything to your ability to penetrate the market with either existing or new GPU products as the year progresses?","Lisa Su","So when we look at the GPU market and let's separate gaming and data center. I think on the gaming side from what we are seeing, we did see sell out increase in Q4 versus Q3. So gamers are still buying GPUs. They may be more discerning about price points. And so I can imagine that there might be a bit more softness at the high end versus in the mid range. But we believe that we have a good understanding of what's happening in the gaming side of the business, and it will be driven. Our gaming growth will be driven by new products. We would see that as we go through this year and with our Radeon 7 launch, as well as our Navi launches on the gaming side.","On the data center side, we're making good progress in GPU data center, obviously, from a low base. But the GPUs and the data center are very workload dependent. And there are some workloads that actually we do very well in things like cloud gaming and virtualization and we have some early HPC wins. And so we see this as customer acquisition need deployments. And so those are the sources of growth on the GPU side for us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.","Aaron Rakers","Just two questions if I can, building on that last one. In your prepared remarks you noted that you've reached a milestone of which GPUs as well as data center CPUs reach a mid-teens percentage of your total revenue. I'm curious as you contemplated your full year guidance. Where do you think that mix of business can go? And is there a point in time where we actually, you foresee us giving granularity on how big the data center GPU business is trending?","Lisa Su","So, I think the mid-teens percentage revenue for us in Q4 was a good milestone. I mean I think that's a meaningful percentage of our revenue. And it was a contributor to our gross margin as we exited 2018. I think as we go into 2019, again, we will continue to give you visibility into where the data center growth is. To be fair of my expectation is that the CPU side of the data center business will grow faster than the GPU side just given what we see in terms of overall deployments. But I think both businesses will be meaningful for us and are a key part of the growth story for us in 2019. And we will continue to give color on how they develop as the year develops.","Aaron Rakers","And then just real quickly on the semicustom side, as you contemplated the guidance as well through the courses here in that 20% decline for the full year. Is your assumption that Q1 marks the bottom and we can grow seasonally off of that level? Or should we think about something differently from a progression through the quarters in '19?","Lisa Su","Aaron, that's the correct way to think about it. So, Q1 will be a low, Q2 will be higher, Q3 will be higher, and then Q4 will come down again. That should be the seasonality of semicustom.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live.","John Pitzer","So notwithstanding that the macro is extremely uncertain making any predictions difficult. I\u2019m just curious going back to Ross' question. How do you see the cadence of growth sequentially throughout the year? Because as he pointed out if you divide it up equally by quarter, you\u2019re growing north of 20% in Q2, Q3, Q4 half on half growth would be somewhere around 50%. If you assume more seasonal and seasonal is a little bit difficult to get to, because of change in accounting, I think you can get half on half growth to 75%. So as you think about the full year growth, is this something that\u2019s more like 50% half on half or 75% half on half?","Lisa Su","It might be a little bit early for us to go there, but what I would say is the following. When we look at the year-on-year compares from 2019 to 2018, Q2 2018 was still a very strong quarter for us, because we still had a significant amount of Blockchain sales in 2018. So I expect that we will grow sequentially into Q2, but I think that will still be, let's call it, a tougher year-on-year compare. But then when we get into the second half of the year, we expect to be fully ramped on the entire 7 nanometer portfolio. And so we would see a heavier weighting in the second half. So we see sequential growth into second quarter, but more heavily weighted into the second half.","John Pitzer","And then, Devinder, on the profitability front if you run the numbers from Q1 guidance to what you need to be exiting Q4 at to hit the full year number, you could see revenue up well over $1 billion Q1 to Q4. I\u2019m a little bit surprised that despite that, the gross margin guidance isn\u2019t a little bit better. I know you guided the full year to greater than 41 with Q1 at 41. But I\u2019m curious if you look at Q4 run rate that\u2019s north of a billion higher than the Q1 run rate. How should we think about gross margin and operating margin existing the year?","Devinder Kumar","If you look back the last many quarters I think seven quarters year-over-year, we have improved gross margin on the strength of the newer products. We ended the year quite well in 2018 and achieved gross margin in the fourth quarter that was nice, and now we start the year with 41%. And as we start the year, it's only we're guiding greater than 41%. I think you should expect that as the products ramp in particular with the 7 nanometer product that Lisa referenced, our margins should continue to improve and we will see where we end up by the end of the year. But we do expect that year-on-year margin goes up from where we ended in 2018 at 39% and greater than 41% for 2019.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live.","Mitch Steves","First on the C&G side, I realized that there's going to be a lot of sequential difficulties there. But when I think about the long-term growth rate, I know you guys have talked to high singles to double-digit growth. Is that still essential where you think that business can grow at long-term? And then secondly in terms of the next EPYC 2. Is there any reason why it would underperform Intel 10 nanometer in a testing environment? And if so, why would that be?","Lisa Su","Let me take the second question and then maybe Devinder you can take the first question. So as it relates to our ROM product, when ROM was originally planned, we had planned that it would be competing against the 10 nanometer product. So that was our expectation when we started. I think we've shown some of the generational performance advantages in terms of double digit performance on a socket basis, 4 times performance on a floating point basis. And the other thing I would say is that with our second generation Rome, the customer set is now more used to our architecture and so some of the architectural and software improvements that we've also spent quite a bit of time on over the last four to six quarters are coming into play. So I think we feel very good about the competitive positioning of Rome. And the other thing to keep in mind is we are deep in development of our next generation Beyond Rome. So the Zen 3 product portfolio is deep in development as well. And so that our goal is to ensure that we have a consistent cadence of very competitive products.","Devinder Kumar","And then as far as your question on the segment growth is concerned relative to high single digits growth for the company level. In both of the segments, there are some factors that come into play. In Computing and Graphics, obviously you feel good about the datacenter side of GPU. But on a compare basis when you look at 2018 to 2019, we do have the impact of the Blockchain and some memory sales from 2018 that don't happen in 2019 from a standpoint of where the market is. And then on the EESC semi-custom in down obviously is a factor when you compare year-on-year for segment. But good growth on the datacenter piece of it in particular with the 7 nanometer Rome product launching in the back half, I mean ramping in the back half of 2019 and that's the way you look at it. It is still early in the year from an overall standpoint. And where we ended up in 2018, we're projecting high single digit growth at the company level for 2019 over 2018.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your line is now live.","Blayne Curtis","Lisa, I just want to ask, you laid it out a little bit. But in terms of EPYC to thin socket but you have sampled it early in terms of getting over the finish line and getting the shift. I guess the customer still has the wafer production of silicon. And then in particular people talk about six to 12 months for those to test and make sure it does everything with the production of silicon. Can you walk us through that timeline, because obviously you're baking in a pretty steep ramp in the second half? Thanks.","Lisa Su","So we started sampling EPYC actually last year so the second half of last year to some of the top cloud vendors, as well as our OEM partners. We've had a significant amount of development with our ODM partners as well. So I think there is a good amount of overlap between the customer development cycle and our development cycle. Now as you said, production of silicon is very key and ensuring that the final certifications are locked in is work that we still have to do here in the first half of this year. But I think we feel good about it. We feel good about the platforms, the customer engagements, the current progress of developments. And so that is very much our plan from an execution standpoint.","Blayne Curtis","And then I just want to ask on the GPU side. It looks like your ASP was up substantially with the data center just kind of curious as we think about the mix of data center. How do you think about the trajectory of that business? I mean is that forced in lumpy as well or is this the go forward level after that pretty sharp initial shipments in December?","Lisa Su","So on the datacenter side we do expect that datacenter GPU business will be a growth driver for us in 2019. It will be a little bit lumpy, so I wouldn't say it's a straight line but I would say on a year-over-year basis, it's a important growth driver for us. And as it relates to the overall datacenter CPU ASPs affecting overall ASPs, I think that's true because the gaming ASPs are or the gaming business was lower than expected given the channel inventory situation. So I think it's also just weighted in terms of the units.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.","Joe Moore","It seems like the GPU datacenter business is doing pretty well. Can you give us some color if you look at mid-teens exposure overall between the two datacenter businesses, CPU and GPU? Can you give us some qualitative sense for how much of that is GPU at this point? And what are the main applications, is it mostly virtualization? What other applications are you seeing there?","Lisa Su","So for the mid-teens percentage of revenue in Q4 between CPU and GPU, it's actually roughly similar. And then in terms of the workloads on the GPU data enter side. We do very well in cloud gaming. We do very well with our virtualization solutions and we have some early traction in HPC.","Joe Moore","And then I guess just in terms of the business segmentation, I think you alluded to this earlier. But it seems like the conversation typically is around microprocessor graphics and semi custom as three different opportunities. Have you thought about moving the segmentation to more in line with that? And I realize it's easier to talk about and hard to implement. But what's your thought in terms of overtime migrating that more in line with the way you guys talk about the business?","Lisa Su","So we look at the business in all different cuts. As you can imagine, we look at it by segment our CG and EESG. CG is very much a PC driven segment and EESG with enterprise and semi custom. And we are, also based on some of the feedback, trying to be a little bit more granular in terms of how the various businesses fall underneath that. So I think as the datacenter business becomes a larger piece of our business, we'll continue to look for how do we give you guys more color and more transparency in how that is going.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Your line is now live.","Vijay Rakesh","Just in terms of the GPU gaming side, you mentioned higher inventory levels. I was wondering if you can give us some number on where normal inventory GPU levels are and where are they running currently? Thanks.","Lisa Su","So when we look at the GPU channel inventory, we do believe our channel partners reduce inventory in Q4 and they will reduce inventories in Q1. We still think the Q1 levels are elevated and there will be some spill over into Q2, and we will see some elevated inventory levels. We'll have to see how the sell-through really, really plays out. But my expectation is that in Q2 will have improved channel inventory levels and we will return to sequential growth in the gaming side of our business.","Vijay Rakesh","And on the 7-nanometer side, is the 7-nanometer GPU and CPU as those ramp in the back half. Are they accretive to this 41% gross margin levels? Thanks.","Lisa Su","So the 7-nanometer GPUs on the data center side started ramping in Q4. So that was part of the data center GPU revenue that we've talked about. The 7-nanometer CPU will ramp middle of the year. And the 7-nanometer CPU and GPU are both above corporate average margins.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference may be recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host the Corporate Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations Ms. Ruth Cotter. Ma'am, you may begin.","Ruth Cotter ","Thank you, and welcome to AMD's third quarter conference call. By now you should have had the opportunity to review a copy of our earnings release and the CFO Commentary and slides. If you have not reviewed these documents, they can be found on AMD's website at ir.amd.com. Participants on today's conference call are Lisa Su, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Devinder Kumar, our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. This is a live call and will be replayed via webcast on amd.com.","I would like to highlight a few dates for you. Lisa Su, will be present at the Wells Fargo Tech Media Telecom Conference on November10th in New York and at the Credit Suisse Annual Technology Conference on December 2nd in Arizona, Devinder Kumar will present at the Raymond James Technology and communications Investor conference on December 8th in New York and our fourth quarter player time will began at the close of business on Friday December 11th 2015.","Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.","Additionally please note that non-GAAP financial measures referenced during this call are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in the press release and CFO Commentary posted which are on our website at quarterlyearnings.amd.com. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's earnings press release and CFO Commentary for more information. You will also find detailed discussions about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC and in particular AMD's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 27, 2015.","Now, with that, I'll hand the call over to Lisa. Lisa?","Lisa T. Su ","Thank you, Ruth, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. We successfully executed many of our near term technical priorities in the third quarter. Were also taking several key steps as a part of our longer term strategy to focus AMD on delivering great products driving deeper customer relationships and simplifying our business.","Highlights include delivering strong double digit sequential revenue growth in each of our business segments, expanding our prior portfolio with the introduction of several new APUs and GPUs that improve our competitive positioning in key markets, forming the Radeon Technologies Group to bring a vertical focus to our graphics business and help strengthen our performance in traditional graphics markets while simultaneously establishing leadership initiatives in immersive computing markets like virtual and augmented reality, and in the third quarter we also tapped out multiple products in FinFET technologies across both of our foundry partners that are on track to enter production next year.","We also took targeted actions in the quarter to streamline portions of our business as a part of aligning our cost structure with our revenue profile and we are took an inventory write down primarily on some of our previous generation APUs largely related to weaker than expected PC demand. While not ideal we believe the write down helps ensure we have the appropriate balance of inventory in place given market conditions. ","Looking at our financial performance third quarter sales were 1.06 billion. The sequential increase of 13% included revenue growth across both our computing and graphic segments as well as our enterprise embedded and semi-custom segments. ","In our computing and graphic segment we delivered our first sequential revenue increased in two years. CG revenue increased 12% sequentially primarily due to improved GPU and desktop APU sales. Channel sales also improved sequentially for the second straight quarter as we saw the benefit from the work we completed earlier in the year to reduce channel inventories. We continue to have success with HP in the commercial market as they are seeing accelerating demand for their AMD based systems including increased adoption with key Fortune 500 accounts. ","As a result I'm pleased to share that for the first time AMD was the exclusive launch processor partner for HP's newest EliteBook commercial client systems based on our latest Carrizo PRO APUs which launched at the end of September. Overall PC demand particularly in the consumer markets continues to be somewhat muted as there remains a high volume of Windows 8 based systems still on shelves. As a result OEMs have been slower to ramp their Windows 10 platforms than we anticipated. We did see multiple customers introduce new Carrizo based Windows 10 platforms in the third quarter and we expect additional platforms will come to market in the fourth quarter. ","Shifting now to Graphics. GPU revenue increased again sequentially as we grew both OEM and channel sales based on the strength of our latest desktop and notebook offerings. Our strategy to profitably regain share by capturing key hardware and software technology transitions like HBM and DirectX 12 is gaining traction. ","We expanded our Fury family of HBM enabled GPUs in the quarter to include the Fury Nano the world's smallest and most power efficient enthusiast desktop graphics card. We delivered strong double-digit percentage sequential revenue growth in the high-end enthusiast and performance portions of the GPU market based on the success of our flagship Fury line of energy efficient products. ","On the software side, our GC and GPU architecture is delivering up to a 30% performance increase on applications written for the next generation of low level programming APIs like Microsoft\u2019s DirectX 12 that are being quickly adopted by developers. ","Turning to our enterprise embedded and semi-custom segment. Revenue increased 13% sequentially driven by strong semi-custom sales to support holiday game console demand. We are on track to set an annual record for semi-custom unit shipments in 2015. Demand from Sony and Microsoft indicates that the record setting sales pace of this generation of game consoles will remain strong. We also remain on track to begin revenue shipments of our additional semi-custom design wins starting in the second half of 2016. ","As a part of further diversifying into the medical communications and non-console gaming markets we've planned to expand our embedded product offering this quarter with the introduction of our newest R-Series SOC which will deliver significant performance per watt improvements compared to our previous generation and offer industry leading graphics capabilities for embedded designs. ","Today we also announced that we have signed a definitive agreement with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics to form a joint venture combining AMD's high-volume assembly and test facilities and experienced workforce with NFME established OSAT expertise. Today's announcement is another example of how we are executing the strategy we outlined at our financial Analyst Day in May to focus the company on improving our long-term financial performance by building great products and simplifying our business model. Forming a back-end manufacturing joint venture is a significant step towards achieving these goals, as we align our operating models with other fabless companies and strengthened our balance sheet. ","Looking to the fourth quarter and beyond our priorities are clear. First we must make more progress returning our Computing and Graphics business to a healthy trajectory by ramp increase our unit shipments, further penetrating the commercial client market, regaining profitable GPU share, and maintaining healthy OEMs and channel inventory levels. ","While we are not anticipating Windows 10 will drive a dramatic near-term PC refresh cycle the continued adoption of Windows 10 which has already been installed on more than 110 million PCs to date, provides a great opportunity for AMD over the coming year based on a semi-consumer and commercial refresh cycle environment. Second, we must continue delivering strong new products. This includes successfully executing key design milestones through our breakout Zen CPU Core. Zen remains on track for availability in 2016 and we believe will return AMD to the mainstream server and high-end client market in a significant way in 2017 and beyond. We are also focused on delivering our next generation GPUs in 2016 designed to improve performance per watt by 2x compared to our current offerings based on design architectural enhancements as well as advanced FinFET products process technology. ","Third, we must further strengthen our balance sheet through continued improvements in our financial performance and strategic accidents like our joint venture with Nantong Fujitsu. One of our most valuable assets is our patent portfolio. We own foundational patents processing, graphics, semiconductor, fabrication and other technologies. This portfolio is not broadly licensed and could provide a significant source of revenue for years to come. We believe we have the right long-term strategy to return AMD to profitability and the correct set of priorities that will help us navigate the near term. ","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our third quarter financial performance. Devinder?","Devinder Kumar","Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will be referencing non-GAAP figures, except for revenue which is on a GAAP basis. I'm pleased to the progress we made in the third quarter with 12% sequential revenue growth in our Computing and Graphics segment and seasonally strong sales in our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Additionally we've continued to simplify our business model and sharpen our financial focus as evidenced by the manufacturing joint venture announcement for our ATMP Facilities which will also bolster our balance sheet and the restructuring actions which will help reduce cost.","First let me review the third quarter numbers. Third quarter revenue was $1.06 billion, up 13% sequentially, driven primarily by seasonally stronger sales of our Semi-Custom SoCs and improved desktop processor and GPU sales. The year-over-year decline of 26% was driven largely by decreased sales across our Computing and Graphics products. Gross margin was 23%, down 5 percentage points sequentially, gross margin was impacted in the quarter by a 65 million inventory write down comprising primarily older generation APUs. The impact of the inventory write down was 6 percentage points. ","Before I cover the rest of the financial performance of the quarter let me briefly recap the restructuring plan we announced at the beginning of October. It is the latest step to simplify our business and better align our resources on our priorities and business outlook. As a result of these actions we expect to reduce global headcount by approximately 5% by the end of Q1 2016. Total restructuring and other special charges in Q3 2015 were 48 million comprised of 41 million related to the recent restructuring plan and 7 million of this [indiscernible] related charges from our 2014 restructuring plan. ","Operating expenses in the third quarter were $336 million, down $17 million from the prior quarter including $2 million of savings related to our 2015 restructuring plan. In our fiscal third quarter the operating loss was $97 million and net loss was $136 million, or $0.17 per share loss, calculated using 785 million shares. The impact of the inventory write down to the loss per share was $0.08. ","Net interest expense, other expense and taxes were $39 million in the quarter, down from $44 million in the prior quarter due primarily to a decline in other expenses. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $55 million, compared to negative $42 million in the prior quarter.","Now, turning to the business segments; Computing and Graphics Segment revenue was $424 million, up 12% sequentially, primarily due to higher sales of GPUs and desktop processors. Computing and Graphics segment operating loss was 181 million compared to a 147 million in the prior quarter primarily driven by an inventory write down of older generation products partially offset by higher revenue. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $637 million, up 13% from the prior quarter, driven by seasonally higher sales of our Semi-Custom SoCs. Operating income of this segment was $84 million, up from $27 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to the absence of the $33 million technology node transition charge in Q2 2015 and higher sales.","Let me now cover today's joint venture announcement. We signed a definitive agreement with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics to form an industry-leading Assembly Test Mark impact or ATMP joint venture to which we contribute our ATMP facilities in Malaysia and China. The value of the deal is approximately $436 million and upon the close of the transaction AMD will pertain a 15% ownership in the joint venture. We expect to receive $371 million in cash, from our partner with net proceeds of approximately $320 million after taxes and other expenses at closing which is expected in the first half of 2016 after all regulatory and other approvals. ","We expect the transaction to be cost neutral to the P&L with significantly reduced capital expenditures for the company. In addition as a result of the plans for our ATMP facilities the balance sheet reflects held for sale accounting of the ATMP assets and liabilities with associated inventory property, plant and equipment and accounts payable balances been reclassified to other current assets and other current liabilities with an impact of a 119 million and 81 million respectively.","As our business model continues to evolve and based on recent questions from some investors I want to take a moment to cover our cash and working capital management needs. As you know we target managing cash within the range of 600 million to 1 billion and cash may on occasion trend to the lower end of that range with the expectation that it depends to the mid-range or better thereafter. We are comfortable with this because of the lower quarterly revenue run rate, lower OpEx, focus on reducing inventory and continuing efforts to improve sales seniority. In addition there is a disproportionate impact on cash of approximately 70 million during the first quarter and third quarters of each year based on our current net profile that is also a factor on cash balances. ","Additionally the JV transaction should result in cash generation of approximately 320 million in the first half of 2016 with a significant CapEx reduction to an approximate 60 million annual run rate. We also believe we have the ability to generate significant revenue by licensing or other monetizing -- otherwise monetizing our IP portfolio. Lastly if needed, we have other options available to bolster cash. Namely tapping our asset back loan of which 230 million is drawn as of the end of the quarter or accessing the capital markets. Over the longer-term we look forward to de-risk our debt maturity profile, reduced interest expense and allocate excess cash over 1 billion to reducing debt.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash and cash equivalence balances total 755 million at the end of the quarter, down 74 million from the prior quarter primarily due to a 69 million debt interest payment in the third quarter. Inventory was 761 million from down 799 million the prior quarter due to the 65 million inventory write down. Debt as of the end of the quarter was 2.26 million essentially flat from the prior quarter. As of the end of the quarter total borrowing against our secured revolving line of credit was 230 million unchanged from the prior quarter. Free cash flow in the quarter was negative 84 million compared to a negative 75 million in the prior quarter. ","Lastly as mentioned on our last quarter's earnings conference call we are actively working with GlobalFoundries to re-profile our 2015 wafer commitment in line with product demand in the fourth quarter of 2015 and into 2016. As of the end of the third quarter of 2015 we had purchases amounting to 631 million under the fifth amendment of the WSA. We anticipate concluding of a vessel purchase, re-profiling discussions at global foundries before the end of the year. ","Now turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter 2015. AMD expects revenue to decrease 10% sequentially plus or minus 3% due to a seasonal decline in semi-custom sales. We expect Computing and Graphics segment revenue to increase sequentially. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 30%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately 350 million including savings of approximately 7 million from our 2015 restructuring plan. Interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately 45 million. Inventory is expected to be down from Q3. Cash is expected to be approximately flat at 750 million including cash payments of approximately 19 million related to the 2015 restructuring actions. ","In closing we continue to take steps to further simplify our business model manage expenses and make the right investment to deliver on our longer-term strategy and improving financial performance. ","With that I'll turn the call back over to Ruth. Ruth?","Ruth Cotter","Thank you Devinder. Operator we'd like you to now pull the audience please for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Chris Rolland of FBR & Company. Your line is open. ","Chris Rolland ","I'm trying to put the pieces together the guidance particularly for the semi-custom business. the sequential drop is maybe a little bit more than I had thought. And I was just wondering if maybe you could talk us through the moving parts here, is it all units or is there perhaps a step function decrease in pricing? Was there some sort of inventory that was built? How do I think about the step down in Q4?","Lisa T. Su ","So Chris this is Lisa. Let me try to give you some color around that. So if you look at the semi-custom business as a whole, it actually was a very strong third quarter and a strong overall year. So we saw units go up, and we expect units to be up on a full year basis year-over-year and revenue to be modestly up year-over-year as well. When we talk about the Q3 to Q4 guidance we actually ended up Q3 a bit stronger than our original guidance and that was because our customers were ramping semi-custom units prior to the holiday ramped and so September was a very strong month for us, October, November will be strong months as well. Q4 is down seasonally from Q3 on just given the shape of the holiday ramp, so in terms of the magnitude of the overall units from a Q3 plus Q4 standpoint it was it's a pretty much as we would expect and it's really just the timing between Q3 and Q4. As we said and Devinder just mentioned in the prepared remarks we do expect the Computing Graphics business to be up quarter-over-quarter and again that's due to some of the progress that were making in that business.","Chris Rolland ","Okay, great. Thanks Lisa. The next one is for Devinder so congrats on the Assembly Test deal. I guess my question is was there a pre-arranged assembly test supplier agreement that you guys worked out as part of the deal and if so how should we think about minimum volumes or pricing or length of the arrangement?","Devinder Kumar","So I think there is the lot of details Chris but let me tell you overall from a view point of the deal. We are very happy to be able to combined our ATMP facilities with the expertise with our partner NFME, they are one of the top most [Indiscernible] in China and as far as the supply arrangement is concerned we have a lot of flexibility overall from my standpoint in the product that we have in factories today, significant portion of that will become part of the JV product but at the same time we have a lot of flexibility to use other [assets] as the case might be.","Chris Rolland ","Okay alright. Was that you do have some capacity that's tied up your flexibility for the rest, is that -- did I understand that correctly?","Devinder Kumar ","Well I think about it, the five year agreement we have products that are running in the factories today but we also have a lot of product that's run in the [assets] that we do business with around the world and as the agreement is implemented but we will have some products in the JV facilities and at the same time lot of flexibilities to make products outside of the JV entities. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Wong of Wells Fargo. Your question, please?","David Wong ","Thanks very much. Following on the earlier question the question just now. When you sell your assembly and test facility to show the stake in them, does that result in any increase in packaging cost when the deal closes? Do you have an estimate of the impact on gross margin if there is an increase?","Devinder Kumar","Yes David as I said in my prepared remarks we expect this to be cost neutral so there should be no impact on packaging our overall cost, we've got a pretty good supplier agreement that we have put in place for the suppliers s don't expect any impact. However I'll add one thing now if you look at the OpEx side of the house you can expect some decline in the OpEx but in the cost side of the house essentially cost neutral.","David Wong ","Okay great. And then in addition to licensing your IP are they any pieces of IP you have that you could sell and if so do you have any estimate of the realizable full value of IP that you might be able to sell out right?","Devinder Kumar ","I think if you look at our overall portfolio of IP we have a lot of IP over this, the company has a strong investment that's made in R&D, Lisa will probably give some details in some sort of various areas but what I'll say about the what our portfolio especially the IP portfolio is we are able to generate revenue and we plan to monetize that for revenue and in some sense if you look at our 10,000 patents of which half are U.S. base, based on present transactions you can imagine the value of the IP portfolio is pretty strong and pretty significant I guess.","So Lisa you want to comment on the IP portfolio itself?","Lisa T. Su ","Yes. David maybe just to expand on that a little bit. Look in terms of our IP portfolio we are very proud of sort of the overall foundational patents that we have across the processors, graphics as well as other semiconductor technologies. Previously we've been more opportunistic in how we've approached licensing and we believe that there is an opportunity now to be more strategic and deliver about what we do, so in terms of your specific question I think we are open to there are several different avenues including licensing technology, forging partnerships, perhaps sales of certain pieces of the portfolio, so we are considering all of those options.","David Wong ","Okay great. And my last one the 12% sequential that you sold for Computing and Graphics was that driven roughly equally by GPUs in the processor chips and similarly when you expect that segment to grow sequentially in December to expect both parts of it to grow?","Lisa T. Su ","Yes. So David in terms of the overall Computing and Graphics business up 12% I would say was a little bit more heavily weighted on graphics versus computing we do see some strength in both businesses as our product portfolio become stronger and we continue to launch more platforms in the market so we do expect overall growth in Computing and Graphics in Q4.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann of Raymond James. Your line is open.","Hans Mosesmann","Lisa can you give us a sense of what's going on with Zen or actually I should ask with the departure of [indiscernible] that kind of shakes things up quite a bit what is the succession there, I suppose that Zen is already architecturally very well defined, what happened after that in terms of roadmap and Keller\u2019s departure. Thanks. ","Lisa T. Su ","Yes, Hans so let me talk overall about Zen and our roadmap in Zen, as specifically to your question. So as I said in prepared remarks Zen is on schedule for availability in 2016 and first full year of revenue ramp in 2017. As you know these microprocessor projects are multiyear projects so the architecture of the execution team very much in place, I think we\u2019re pleased with the progress and we will continue to work hard to meet our objectives in that area.","In terms of long-term roadmap we are extremely committed to high performance x86 CPUs. And there should be no confusion on that point. Mark Papermaster is currently directly engaging with the team on that execution and we\u2019ll have more details to come. But overall pleased with the execution and it continues to be our number one priority for the company. ","Hans Mosesmann","If I could just as a follow-on relatively on the onset of the equation, we just heard earlier this week Qualcomm jumping into the fray [indiscernible] talked about some of the accelerator type assets what maybe happening next generation hyper scale datacenters. What's AMD's position on all this? There is lots of activity and what are you guys doing because it seems that Seattle or at least your first incarnation of ARM and servers didn't really pan out that much. ","Lisa T. Su ","Yes so Hans I think relative to ARM, I continue to believe ARM has a place in the datacenter both as you think about towards the convergence between networking storage and servers. I think it's fair to say for all of us that it's been slower to adopt in the server market just due to the some of the software and the infrastructure. Relative to Seattle we will be starting our first modest production shipments in the fourth quarter in this coming quarter this year. I view it as a longer-term bet, so no question that server market is attractive, datacenter is attractive, we\u2019re very focused on it from an X86 standpoint and we\u2019ll continue our ARM efforts in a complementary way. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Your question please. ","Harlan Sur ","So if you give us sort of a relatively brief update on Zen. If you just give us an update on Zen from a performance perspective, it\u2019s a new core architecture or new process technology. I think you kicked on a couple of chips last quarter, any feedback on the performance or the yield metrics that gives the team confidence on the broad rollout of the different product families starting next year. ","Lisa T. Su ","So Harlan let me [indiscernible] it this way. As we stated in the Financial Analyst Day we had a target of 40% IPC performance of Zen over our previous generation. We believe we\u2019re on track for that. Relative to process technology we've tapped out multiple products to multiple fabs in FinFET, and we believe that they are also on track in terms of overall ramp. So we continue to focus on both of those aspects, both the architecture of the process technology but so far so good. ","Harlan Sur ","And then does the joint venture agreement also include transferring over your HBM technology to the JV? And does the JV have the right to offer this capability to some of its customers? HBM seems to be a fairly differentiated performance feature for AMD, wouldn\u2019t want to see that being offered to other potential competitors. Any comments would be appreciated there.","Lisa T. Su ","So the high bandwidth memory technology that we introduced on our Fury line of products is actually done jointly with several [indiscernible]. So we have definitely put a lot of R&D into the technology and those are ramping today, and they are not part of the JV per se. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ian Ing of MKM Partners. Your question please. ","Ian Ing ","Devinder thank you for laying out all the sources and usage of cash so you're guiding this 750 million cash, you're going to get some proceeds from the assembly and test sale I guess sometime mid-year. So between now and then what are the true contractual obligations you have, is it really things like interest and restructuring payments. I know you've got obligations to global foundries but then again there is no penalties there. So just a true obligations in your mind. ","Devinder Kumar","I think if you at it from a view point of the specific items that you mentioned, you're right. You are right about the restructuring actions, but the cash payments if I summarize the restructuring plan that we announced earlier this month $26 million of cash payments, 7 million actually occurred in Q3, 19 million to be paid out in Q4 and then as we get into the 2016 there is another $15 million to be paid on for the restructuring plan and then we are done and that point obviously we get the benefit from the restructuring plan. I mentioned in the remarks that I had that if you look at 2016 there is about $58 million of savings overall from an OpEx standpoint relative to the actions that we took. ","As far as the obligation to the supply agreement, yes you're right do not expect the charges that you talked about and obviously you are booking with GlobalFoundries our partner to go ahead and we profile the timing and the mix of the wafers as we look at the demand profile for Q4 2015 and integrated. ","CapEx I mentioned that in the transaction, not just posting the balance sheet with cash some time in Q1 2016, so the CapEx comes down by about 40 million from the current annual rate of 100 to 40 so net net I think when I look at all the [fells] and play all else be equal i feel good about the actions we have taken from a cash standpoint and you've seen us manage the cash within the range that we have played out and I went for a little bit more detail in this particular earnings call in terms of all the various areas and how we look at cash management as far as working capital management.","Ian Ing ","Great thanks. And then follow up enterprise embedded Semi-Custom I'm just trying to see how it can possibly grow next year, you have gain consoles obviously, regular ASP declines year-over-year, what should we think of the main drivers of new revenue that could perhaps get you over this year's type of revenue run rate, is it the other Semi-Custom wins or is it some other areas?","Lisa T. Su","Yes. So the way I would think about the enterprise embedded and Semi-Custom segment in terms of longer term revenue growth, in 2016 as we said we will have additional Semi-Custom revenue ramping in the second half of 2016 so I think that would be one driver and then as we go into the medium term with them that would be more of the 2017 revenue driver.","Ian Ing ","Okay and then if I sit in one more, your computing graphics revenues up nicely in the September quarter, looks like your operating loss though grew sequentially, just trying to figures that sort of some transient marketing cost or is that some other things going on there in terms of the operating loss growing. ","Devinder Kumar","Yes couple of things. When you look at the numbers from a segment recording standpoint you are right that the operating loss did go up but within the operating loss in Q3 of 2015 the inventory write down that I talked about the 65 million, the larger portion of that is within the Computing and Graphics segment so it skews the results from an overall operational standpoint. So if you adjust for that the improvement even though it was a loss was there from Q2 to Q3 on the higher revenue.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Chin of UBS. Your question, please?","Steven Chin","Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Lisa if I could ask you on the graphics side of the business. Just looking at your AID business for the graphics boards can you talk about how those parts in particular performed relative to the overall graphics business in terms of their sequential growth and how the sell in sell out would be in and kind of what was your view on saved inventories exiting the quarter and kind of what the expectations are specially for?","Lisa T. Su","Yes, so sure. So if I look at the overall graphics business we did see growth across both the desktop as well as the notebook portion of the business, relative to AID the third quarter was really the start of the ramp of the Fury series as well as the R9 series and I think was the transition quarter in terms of transition from the older products into the newer products. Relative to inventories actually I think we\u2019re in a good shape on inventories China is a little bit sluggish and we see that across both graphics as well as computing, all other regions are in good shape.","Steven Chin","Great. And as a follow up, in terms of the blended ASPs you guys noted that it was flat sequentially but up year-over-year. Can you just talk about just from a mix standpoint how you expect it to progress in the current quarter? Are you expecting the mix to continue skewing towards a richer Fury, a new product pushing the portfolio or do you expect a good amount of lower end GPUs sold in [the same] quarter?","Lisa T. Su","It's hard to say as we have to look at all the dynamics but it's fair to say that the AIB ASPs are trending upwards because we have been now a solid offering in the enthusiast and performance segments where we did not before. Relative to overall ASPs I think we will have to comment on that next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst ","Thank you. This is Shankar on behalf of Vivek. Just want to touch upon the console side of things again. So you mentioned the Fury growth was strong in Q3 but can you give us a sense on how the ASPs have trended this year and then how should we model ASP trends this year?","Lisa T. Su","Yes so. Let`s see what's the best way to say that. I think what I said was overall units were up year-over-year 2015 to 2014 as we project into the fourth quarter. Revenue was up modestly so the ASP decline is modeled in there. As we go into 2016 again I expect that units will be up given our current visibility. The ASPs are known so the main thing will be they are just looking at -- and you can easily vary a couple of million units that this early in the cycle. So I won't say exactly where I expect revenue to be but those are the relative trends I expect units to be up ASPs on the same order and we have to see where that actually heads up. ","Unidentified Analyst ","And then my follow-up is on the graphic side of business. Obviously you're shipping new products into the market but can you talk about what your overall gaming plan is and how fast you think that market will grow? And how fast you think you can grow in this market?","Lisa T. Su ","So yes, I think we\u2019re very [bolt on] a graphics market as a whole. When you think about discreet graphics and the gaming portion of it as well as the newer applications, immersive applications around virtual reality is tough. The conventional wisdom that ASPs are going down is probably modified by the fact that there is with 4K with DX12 with some of these other drivers, virtual reality that there is more use for graphics horsepower. Going forward I think we have a lot that we can do in terms of product portfolio, so we\u2019re very focused on launching sort of our 2016 products that will be significant architectural and process technology enhancements and we continue to believe that graphics is a growth business for us. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay of Canaccord. Your line is open. ","Matt Ramsay ","Lisa, I just wanted to ask another question on the overall graphics market in follow-up to the last question. I think conventional wisdom among investors is that maybe AMD has focused mostly on the console business and your primary competitor is focused on the PC gaming business. And as trends -- I guess, first of all, do you agree with that? And just give a commentary on how you are focusing your investments. And second, as things like the eSports phenomenon take off, how do you feel the Company is positioned to benefit from that? Thanks. ","Lisa T. Su ","I think it's fair to say we\u2019re focused on overall gaming. It turns out that we have a very strong position in game consoles so certainly that's a great business for us. I think PC gaming with our focus on both hardware and software optimization particularly as we move from DX 11 to DX 12 as you talk about some of the online gaming initiatives. I think we\u2019re actually very well positioned both with our APUs as well as our discrete GPUs. So in terms of investments I think you'll see us continue to invest and invest heavily in the graphics area. And as I said earlier I think it's a growth area for us. The fact that we\u2019re strong in game consoles, I think is a benefit and we\u2019ll continue to leverage how we can bring the game console and the PC gaming architectures closer together over time. ","Unidentified Analyst ","Great, thank you for that. And Devinder, I just wanted to follow up on some questions that were asked earlier in the call about the JV and the impact of that. It looks like there is a significant number of employees that will be going into the JV from AMD outright. Could you potentially quantify the impact on operating expense that you see maybe pre the deal and then post that deal closing and how we should think about the OpEx trajectory going forward? Thanks. ","Devinder Kumar","A little bit [indiscernible] that we signed an agreement today and announced the deal today, we have work to do get the regulatory approvals to go ahead and get the deal closed and at the same time go ahead and get the deal done, and then you're right about the significant number of employees moving away to the tune of 1,700 employees and relative to our bas of about 9,500 that\u2019s close to 20% when you look at it from that standpoint. So I think as we look for the details of how the JV is going to work [indiscernible] employees, I'll be able to give more color but I believe from the view point of what we have negotiated from a costing standpoint as I said earlier as a cost neutral from our standpoint and then OpEx as I said there should be benefit but too early to been quantify that I think I'll be able to get sort of that when we close the transaction. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your question please. ","Joe Moore ","First, I have just a housekeeping question. I think before when you have taken these inventory reserves, they haven't been included in non-GAAP, if I'm remembering that correctly, and now you are leaving the inventory reserve in non-GAAP. Can you talk about is there something different about this reserve than what you have seen before that there is a different treatment of it? ","Devinder Kumar","I don't recall, if I have to go back to I think the 2012 timeframe when the PC market shifted pretty significantly and everybody felt the effects of that in the 2012 timeframe we had that impact. So we had the non-GAAP treatment for the inventory write-down at that point and we\u2019re consistent with the way we do it. If you look at it from a viewpoint of how we talk about our numbers, putting in the non-GAAP and then comparing it and then we call it out from an inventory write-down standpoint where we have even in my script given the adjusted numbers in terms of what the impact is to EPS as well as the gross margin of the [indiscernible]. I think we are fairly consistent, that might have been something that you recall we took and an LTM adjustment that might have been included in the -- not included in the non-GAAP numbers but when you do an inventory write down from an AMD standpoint as far as I can recall, we've always have left that in the non-GAAP numbers. ","Unidentified Analyst ","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And then, my second question is back to your graphics business. You had a nice sequential quarter, but I still have your GPU business down quite a lot year over year. Now that you have products that are more competitive in the enthusiast segment, can you give us an upper bound of what you might be able to achieve there? Is there supply constraints that are keeping this small and are you going to be able to regain the levels that you were at a year ago in GPU? ","Lisa T. Su","Yes so I think one quarter is good progress now you have to watch us over a number of quarters regain that graphics momentum and when I think about it, relative to the period launch of -- we did have some supply constraints in the third quarter, they were -- they are largely [solved] in the fourth quarter so I don\u2019t think there would be any supply constraints. I think it's also fair to say that the graphics portfolio is quite broad and so you will see us updating the entire portfolio over the coming quarters and both on the OEM side and on the AIB side, so again it's a strategic effort, it's not a one or two quarter effort but to regain our graphic share.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Chaurasia of Nomura. Your line is open.","Sanjay Chaurasia","I have a question on your patent portfolio, so it's a two-part question. First question is, is that -- the option of licensing it, is that something have you decided that you will do or this is something you could do in future? And part two is where the demand for such licensing would come from? Does it necessarily imply that it would allow companies to build competing products in graphics and servers? ","Lisa T. Su","Yes. So in terms of our licensing our patents for our technology we have done it from time to time as I said on a more opportunistic basis and that's been both licensing technology as well as overall partnerships. As we go forward we do believe that there is an opportunity to be more strategic in how we approach that and that includes partnerships in certain markets that we are not directly building products out for example as well as working together with other companies that are interested in excess to some of the markets that we are competing in it, so I think both are possible and I would say a strategic effort that we will take on over the next couple of years.","Sanjay Chaurasia","And as a follow up I have a question on your graphics reorganization, could you elaborate a little bit more how does this feel organization a vertical reorganization helps you to recapture graphic share?","Lisa T. Su","Yes it really is in our view listen to some of our themes over the past couple of quarters, it is about a simplifying and providing focus in our business, so graphics isn\u2019t area that is extremely competitive and having all of the graphics resources in a single vertical organization allows us to focus those resources and make good tradeoffs in terms of one of the key market opportunities, so it is again our belief that it's a very important segment for us as well as the computing segment and aligning the resources under Roger [Indiscernible] gives us a very strong strategic as planned upon where we are going with that business over the next couple of years. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Lipacis of Jefferies. Your question, please.","Mark Lipacis","Thanks for taking my questions. Lisa, when you talk about being more strategic on the IP licensing, does that suggest you think about the opportunities here in licensing to your customers more or is that licensing to other semiconductor companies? And on that topic, is that -- is the vision -- can you help us with the vision from the standpoint of how big this could be? Is this something that is a single-digit revenue line item or low double digits or well into the double digits? How should we think about that? ","Lisa T. Su","Look so when I think about licensing again I view it as licensing to partners who are causing complimentary market segments as well as to those in OEM businesses so I mentioned three different areas that was licensing technology joint development partnerships as well as you address the fewer patterns sell relative to how the benchmark is as Devinder said it earlier just 10,000 patterns we think is a strong portfolio one of the strongest in the semiconductor industry our goal would be to monetize it across those various aspects over the next couple of years. So I don\u2019t have the exact number but it is something that we view as very valuable and complementary as to our product development efforts.","Mark Lipacis","Fair enough and then a follow-up, if I may. You mentioned virtual reality and Mark Papermaster has talked about that as an exciting market opportunity. Recently, NVIDIA had announced partnerships with -- to make VR ready notebooks to come out, I think, later this month. Do you have a similar effort to -- do you have something to do something similar on that front, to have a VR-branded ready notebooks with your customers? That's all I have. Thank you. ","Lisa T. Su ","Yes, we are working very actively in the VR space. I think both Mark and Roger have probably talked about it over the last couple of months. We've been working with the budget software developers as well as OEMs and headset manufacturers to put together overall solution. So you'll be hearing more from us in those areas. ","Operator","Yes ma'am. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. ","John Pitzer ","Thanks for sneaking me in. Just a quick question on operating profit by segment. I guess -- the Company has done a good job over the last 12 months taking overall OpEx down by about $75 million, and if I look at the enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom business, revenue is down -- I am sorry, revenue is about flat year over year in the September quarter, but if you look, the op profit is down by about $20 million plus. I am just curious, Devinder. Did some of the inventory write-down hit that segment or just help me understand specifically what's going on with operating profit within the semi-custom business? ","Devinder Kumar","I think a couple of things. If you do the year-on-year comparison, and this is a little bit complicated that last quarter you remember we had the technology note transition charge and this quarter we have a small portion and the inventory write-down in that segment. When I look at the numbers from that standpoint it is down but it is down only slightly from the view point of competing from a year-ago quarter to where it is today. And one of the thing that happening that this [indiscernible] we've had situation where we launched couple of products two years ago you ramped the product we've the swing under this with us and we\u2019re investing in that business and obviously that generate some expenses that go into that particular segment. ","Lisa T. Su ","And maybe John just to give you little bit more color on that. So there was a smaller portion of the inventory write-down that was in the EESE segment, but if you're comparing year-on-year you also have to remember that in EESEs also server and embedded and those tend to be the highest margin parts of our portfolio and those are down year-over-year. So although semi-custom game consoles are up those are down and that had a little bit of effect on the margin mix in that business. ","Unidentified Analyst ","That's helpful. Then maybe as my follow-on, turning to computing and graphics, even if I exclude the inventory write-down in the September quarter, you are still running at greater than $100 million per quarter operating loss there. Lisa, how do you think about, and hopefully this was the first quarter, as you pointed out, in two years you saw sequential growth, so you turned the corner. But importantly, as you think about bringing that business to breakeven, what are the most important levers in your mind over the next four to eight quarters?","Lisa T. Su ","John good question. Look we call the drop in the second quarter it was important for us return the corner on the business, but as you said it's a multi quarter effort to bring the business back to breakeven. We\u2019re taking a number of actions in terms of what we\u2019re doing there. There are OpEx actions as part of the restructuring efforts that we\u2019re talking about, there are gross margin actions particularly as we see a ramp of our new Carrizo and our new commercial products you should see some mix improvements in that business as well, and we need to get the revenue up there is no question that we need to driver top line margin expansion as well as operating expenses. I do believe that we\u2019ll make significant progress in 2016 and we see lots of good signs they just don't show up yet in the financials that you see. So we need to continue to make progress in those areas.","Operator","And our final question comes from Vijay Rakesh of Mizuho. Your line is open. ","Vijay Rakesh ","Just a question if it hasn't been asked before. If you look at 2016, the industry, how do you see -- what do you see on PC units? And then, I have a follow-up. Thanks. ","Lisa T. Su ","I think if you look at the PC market, [IDC] has recently come out with some numbers on the third quarter and into 2015, but we expect the market to be down in 2016 modestly over 2015. We will also expect that we\u2019ll continue to have some choppiness in certain regions particularly in the emerging markets relative to the mature markets and we\u2019ll have to see how the next few quarters play out from a market standpoint. ","Vijay Rakesh ","And when you look at your business for 2016 any thoughts in how the mix between PCs and semi-custom shakeout. And also with this foundry agreement does it get you any lower taxes with Malaysia or Penang?","Devinder Kumar","I can address the tax question, Lisa can address the 2016. If you look at our tax line it's very minimal, the way our finances are on the maybe a various tax process in the locations especially in China and Malaysia so we have not been paying any amount of significant taxes in those areas, they are pretty minimal, so since we pay minimal once the JV is formed at the time of closure it will be a JV seem to go ahead and take care of the taxes but the thing that I can also throw in since you are looking at the accounting and the taxes is we will account for this particular JV once it's formed in an equity accounting method so it won\u2019t affect all the lines of the P&L or it is just by sharing the in the bottom line of the JV on an equity basis in which we have 15% by ownership of the JV. Lisa?","Lisa T. Su","Yes so on your question about sort of rough revenue mix in 2016, without being too exact I think you should expect it to be roughly 50-50 or so that's what we said, we expect sort of a steady state model to be roughly half SEG and half EESG going forward.","Ruth Cotter","Thank you, operator. And that concludes our call for today and we'd like to thank everyone for participating and look forward to see many of you at the conferences will be attending and for the rest of the quarter.

Ma'am, you may begin.","Ruth Cotter","Thank you, and welcome to AMD's first quarter conference call. By now you should have had the opportunity to review a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary and accompanying slides. If you have not reviewed these documents, they can be found on AMD's website at ir.amd.com.","Participants on today's conference call are Lisa Su, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Devinder Kumar, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","This is a live call and will be replayed via webcast on amd.com.","I would like to take this opportunity to highlight a few dates for you. AMD will host its Financial Analyst Day on May 6 in New York. Devinder Kumar will present at the Jefferies 2015 Technology Media and Telecom Conference on May 13 in Miami. And our second quarter quiet tired will begin at the close of business on Friday, June 12, 2015.","Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it.

Lisa?","Lisa Su","Thank you, Ruth, and good afternoon to all those listening in today.","Under the backdrop of a weaker than expected PC market, our first quarter results demonstrate that we continue making progress in some areas of our business but still have work to do to improve our overall financial performance.","First quarter revenue of $1.03 billion decreased 17% sequentially, primarily due to reduced client and graphics product sales and a seasonal decrease in semicustom system-on-chip sales. In our computing and graphics segment, revenue decreased 20% sequentially in what was a challenging market environment compounded by currency issues. We saw OEM demand in the quarter below seasonal expectations as our customers actively managed inventory levels amid uncertain end-user demand. We also reduced downstream channel inventory levels and remain on track to return to normal inventory levels by the end of the second quarter. As a result of soft PC demand and our work to rebalance our channel demand inventory, desktop processor and GPU revenue decreased significantly from the year-ago period.","On the positive side, we did see progress in several of our strategic initiatives. Mobile APU ASPs and revenue increased from the year-ago period, highlighted by increases in commercial client APU shipments and revenue from the fourth quarter, setting a record for commercial client processor sales. Our focused commercial client strategy is gaining momentum and our investments are driving awareness and generating pull with commercial and government buyers.","We delivered record FirePro server unit shipments in the quarter, driven by enterprise wins and AMD professional GPUs now being offered in the world's highest volume server, HP's DL380. We also successfully passed several key milestones in the quarter as we prepared for the introduction of our new 2015 APU and GPU products, including first revenue shipments of our next-generation Carrizo family of notebook APUs in advance of system launches planned for the second quarter. Carrizo is a standout product that delivers better graphics performance than competitive offerings, as well as all-day battery life, driven by the largest generational performance per watt improvement we have ever delivered with our mainstream APUs.","Now turning to our enterprise embedded and semicustom segment. Revenue declined 14% sequentially, largely driven by lower game console royalties and a seasonal decrease in semicustom SoC console sales. Embedded processor sales were roughly flat from the year-ago period with weaker than expected thin client demand, offset by continued adoption of our embedded APUs across targeted market segments.","Samsung introduced a new AMD powered digital signage solution and both Fujitsu and GE intelligent platforms released new industrial computing boards powered by AMD embedded SoC's in the quarter.","At the corporate level, we continue aligning larger portions of our R&D investments to take advantage of long-term growth opportunities across our EESC segment. As we prioritize our R&D investments and simplify our business, we made the decision in the first quarter to exit the dense server systems business as we increase investments in our server processor development. We retained the fabric technology as a part of our overall IP portfolio.","We see very strong opportunities for next-generation high-performance x86 and ARM processors for the enterprise datacenter and infrastructure markets, and will continue to invest strongly in these areas.","Looking forward in the year, given the ongoing macroeconomic and currency uncertainties, it is hard to predict when the PC environment will normalize. We expect that the overall PC market will remain a challenge as our OEM customers and channel partners focus on carrying lean inventories based on the uncertain market conditions. However, we are preparing for a better second half of the year, with Windows 10 and our new product offerings as catalysts for the business.","Regardless of market conditions, we are taking important steps to improve our CG business by completing our channel inventory rebalancing, introducing strong new APU and graphics products, and continuing to grow commercial client sales.","I remain optimistic about our long-term opportunities, but realistic that the next several quarters will be challenging due to the market environment. Our strategy to improve our financial performance is to focus on our strengths by continuing the investments in the technology and IP that will drive product innovation and differentiation.","I look forward to talking in more detail about our long-term strategy and growth opportunities at our Financial AnalystS Day in May, and I hope many of you on the call will join us for that event.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our first quarter financial performance. Devinder?","Devinder Kumar","Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon everyone.","Q1 was a challenging quarter with disappointing financial results as we faced a weaker than expected PC environment. We made good progress on rebalancing the channel inventory and took actions to further streamline our focus on the opportunities for long-term growth. Let me move to the specifics of the quarter, where I'll be referencing non-GAAP figures except for revenue which is on a GAAP basis.","Revenue was $1.03 billion, down 17% sequentially, driven primarily by lower sales of our client and graphics processor products and seasonally lower semicustom sales. The year-over-year decline of 26% was driven primarily by decreased client and graphics sales.","Gross margin was 32%, down 2 percentage points from the prior quarter, primarily due to product mix and lower game console royalties in the first quarter. Operating expenses in the first quarter were $357 million, down $9 million from the prior quarter, due primarily to lower sales and marketing spending in line with the lower revenue in the quarter.","Operating loss was $30 million and net loss was $73 million or $0.09 per share calculated using 777 million shares. Our first quarter results include restructuring and other special charges amounting to $87 million, of which $75 million are charges related to the exiting of the dense server systems business and another $12 million was related to facilities activities and severance charges under the fourth quarter 2014 restructuring plan. All but $16 million of these charges are non-cash. These charges are excluded from our segment results and are included in the all other category. They're also excluded from our first quarter non-GAAP earnings per share calculation.","Net interest expense, taxes and other income was $43 million in the quarter, up from $34 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to a non-recurring tax credit and gain on debt repurchases in the fourth quarter.","Adjusted EBITDA was $13 million, down from $96 million in the prior quarter, and our trailing fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $379 million.","Now turning to the business segments. Computing and graphics revenue was $532 million, down 20% sequentially, primarily due to decreased desktop and netbook revenue. Computing and graphics operating loss was $75 million, compared to $56 million loss in the prior quarter, primarily due to lower desktop and notebook processor sales, partially offset by lower operating expenses.","Enterprise embedded and semicustom revenue was $498 million, down 14% from the prior quarter, primarily due to seasonally lower sales of our semicustom SoC's. And the operating income of this segment was $45 million, down from $109 million in the prior quarter, driven by lower semicustom SoC revenue, lower game console royalties, and product mix. As planned, R&D investments in the embedded enterprise and semicustom segment increased sequentially as we invest for more growth in this segment.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances totaled $906 million at the end of the quarter, down $134 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to lower sales and debt interest payments in the quarter. Inventory was $688 million, essentially flat from the prior quarter.","We entered into a Fifth Amendment to our wafer supply agreement with Global Foundries. Under the terms of the agreement, we expect to purchase approximately $1 billion of wafers in 2015 on a take-or-pay basis. In the first quarter, we spent $161 million on wafer purchases with Global Foundries.","Debt as of the end of the quarter was $2.27 billion. Separately, we have amended and restated our $500 million asset-backed credit facility with more favorable terms. As we have indicated in the past, this ABL affords us with additional financial flexibility as and when needed.","Free cash flow in the first quarter was negative $195 million.","Now turning to the outlook. For the second quarter of 2015, AMD expects revenue to decrease 3% sequentially plus or minus 3%. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 32%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be a proximately $355 million as we continue to invest in new products. Interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $35 million [ph] and inventory is expected to be approximately up $100 million from first quarter levels in support of second half semicustom product revenue and the ramp of new products.","For the full year 2015, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between approximately $340 million and $370 million per quarter, in line with expected revenue profile; taxes of approximately $3 million per quarter; cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances to be within a range between $600 million to $1 billion; capital expenditures of approximately $100 million; and inventory to be approximately flat year over year.","In closing, while we are navigating some difficult industry challenges in the PC market and made progress in improving our general inventory levels in the first quarter, we continue to invest in our product roadmaps and look forward to updating you on our long-term strategy at our upcoming Financial Analysts Day.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ruth. Ruth?","Ruth Cotter","Thank you, Devinder.","Operator, we'd now be happy for you to poll the audience for questions please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, ma'am. [Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies","Thanks for taking my questions. The first one, I guess, is, maybe is for Lisa, the computing and graphics revenue declines have accelerated in each of the last four quarters and down 38% year-over-year. I understand there's some channel flush going on, but basically the guidance looks like it'll be down between 30% and 40% year over year. So I guess I'm wondering, is -- does that revenue trajectory create a motivation to look more aggressively at M&A or joint venture opportunities? And maybe you could just review the AMD strategy or philosophy around M&A and JV opportunities. Thank you.","Lisa Su","Sure, Mark. So thanks for the questions. So let me start with maybe a bit of the backdrop on the computing and graphics business and what's been happening in the market. So certainly the Q1 results are impacted by the fact that the PC market was weaker than we originally expected. We expected when we started in January that we would have a week first quarter due to some of our channel inventory issues. The channel business actually performed pretty close to our expectations, with the exception of some of the currency issues in Europe.","On the MNC [ph] business, we did see some weaker than expected results as a result of some of the commercial hangover and the hangover from Q4.","On the broader question of the computing and graphics business, we have significant product technology and IP that serve this market very well. I think it's important for us to focus on the areas where we can differentiate and innovate. Frankly, the portions of the business that are more commodity like are less attractive to us, and so we have very really focusing on managing the business for improved profitability and improved differentiation. So going forward we'll continue to do that.","You had a question about the second quarter guidance. It is important for us to ensure that we are managing the business in a disciplined way given some of the uncertainties in the market. We are being more cautious on the second quarter. We do expect the second half to be better than the first half as we go forward.","And then relative to M&A and sort of the questions there, I think we are always looking at opportunities to optimize the business, but the computing and graphics business and the enterprise embedded and semicustom business share a lot of synergistic IP, particularly around the processor cores and the graphics IP technology. So we continue to believe that we can differentiate in these areas as we accelerate some of our product investments.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies","Thank you. And a follow-up if I may. As you look in the 2015, which of your businesses you think have the best chance to post revenue growth, and as part of that, could you give us an update on the pipeline in the semicustom business? You announced several design wins late last year. Are those still on track? Is the pipeline getting bigger on semicustom? Thank you very much.","Lisa Su","Yes. So relative to growth and what we see, I think the second half of the year I would say across the board for all of our businesses will be stronger than the first half. Some of that is seasonal and some of that is opportunities that we see to improve our market share, particularly in the graphics business as well as we ramp our semicustom sales into the second half of the year. So those are the key areas there. Was there another question?","Devinder Kumar","Pipeline.","Lisa Su","Oh, the pipeline, yes. On the semicustom pipeline, the semicustom wins that we announced at the end of last year are on track. We expect revenue in 2016, really starting the second half of 2016 for those. Relative to the overall pipeline, I think we continue to get a nice mix, particularly as we're focusing more on the enterprise and embedded space, we're seeing a nice continuum of I would call it standard product to custom product opportunities.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies","Thank you.","Lisa Su","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Wong of Wells Fargo. Your question please.","David Wong - Wells Fargo","Thanks very much. Lisa, can you give us some idea of what your server processor efforts are? If you were primarily to offer semicustom capability and servers in the future or are you making active investment in creating standard x86 and ARM server processor as well?","Lisa Su","Yes, David. So relative to server, we see datacenter, whether cloud or enterprise networking, to be important growth area for us going forward. We are making significant investments in server processors both standard as well as the IP for semicustom opportunities. So think of it as x86, ARM, the technologies required to make competitive server products.","David Wong - Wells Fargo","Okay, great. And Devinder, have you identified any additional assets that you might be interested in selling to raise cash?","Devinder Kumar","If you look at the cash situation, David, from a cash management standpoint, we have managed to be well over the last couple of years to stay in the $600 million to $1 billion range, which is what we've targeted for the several quarters as we have pursued our strategies from a long-term standpoint. We did get some asset sales, if you recall, in the 2013 timeframe. But at this point, I don't see the need to do that from an overall cash management standpoint. So, really nothing to talk about right now.","David Wong - Wells Fargo","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur of J.P. Morgan. Your question please.","Harlan Sur - J.P. Morgan","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. As it relates to the Q2 guidance for revenues to be down about 3% sequentially, can you just kind of help us understand directionally on the relative decline of your two segments, computing and graphics versus your enterprise embedded and semicustom segments? You know, on one hand you're -- it seems like you'd be ramping Carrizo, and I would assume you're already starting to ramp your semicustom chipsets ahead of the console build, but yet on the other hand it still seems like you're burning through some channel inventory. So, lots of moving pieces. Any help from you guys would be great.","Lisa Su","Yes, sure, Harlan. So our second quarter guidance, we would expect that the semicustom units will be up compared to the first quarter. I would say modestly up. Relative to the computing and graphics business, I think we will complete the burn-off of our channel inventory in Q2 based on the current pace that we see. And then on the ramp-up of Carrizo, we will start shipping -- we started shipping actually in Q1 a small volume of units. We'll increase that as we go to Q2.","What we also are factoring in is, you know, with the Windows 10 launch at the end of July, we are watching sort of the impact of that on the back-to-school season, and expect that it might have a bit of a delay to the normal back-to-school season inventory build-up.","Harlan Sur - J.P. Morgan","Great, thanks for that. And then a question for Devinder. Given the sort of current depressed revenue run rate, is the team expecting to burn cash again in Q2? And then just given the overall kind of muted compute demand environment, what's sort of your view or maybe you can give us a range of your cash balance, you know, potentially exiting this year?","Devinder Kumar","Yeah. So if I step back and look at it, and if you look at the balance sheet even in Q1, despite the lower revenue from a year ago and also last quarter, we balanced [ph] the balance sheet across the board pretty well. If we look at the Q1 inventory, we managed to keep it flat despite the lower revenue, the AP is down quarter on quarter rather significantly. We managed the cash, as I said earlier to the earlier question, between $600 million to $1 billion, and I feel we can do that in the Q2 timeframe.","And the other thing is you might have read about the ABL facility that we have to the tune of $500 million. In fact, we just renewed that with more favorable terms just recently and announced that today. So from my standpoint, the takeaway for you should be, you know, we managed cash between the $600 million and $1 billion target.","Harlan Sur - J.P. Morgan","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Your question please.","Unidentified Participant","Hi, this is Sydney Hill [ph] for Ross. Thanks for taking the questions.","Regarding the embedded portion, if my math is right, I think your first -- in Q1 and Q2, your year-over-year growth were both negative. Are you still expecting this business to grow for the full year? I guess it depends on what the gaming side of things as well.","Lisa Su","Yes. So I think your question is probably about the enterprise embedded and semicustom segment and the segment revenues. So, relative, you know, Q1, year over year, I think the, you know, we've mentioned that the semicustom SoC sales were down a bit as well as embedded was relatively flat. As we go full year, we haven't given full-year guidance at the segment level yet. So I think what we've said before, which I still believe is true, is that the semicustom units will likely be up year-over-year, the ASPs are known, we just have to see how the second half of the year develops relative to overall demand.","Unidentified Participant","Okay. And my follow-up question is related to gross margin. I think you're planning to build about $100 million of inventory for semicustom revenue in the back half. Does that mean, all else equal, because semicustom has lower margins, that your overall gross margin will come down in the back half? Or maybe just a broader way of asking the same question, how should we think about the gross margin trajectory for the remainder of the year and what are some of the puts and takes to think about?","Devinder Kumar","Yeah, I think first of all, let's take Q2 first of all from a guidance standpoint. We're guiding flat to Q1. I know the market environment, especially on the PC side, is uncertain. Product mix will be the main driver for the gross margin. And obviously as Lisa remarked earlier, we're very focused on disciplined execution of the business, and we'll continue to do that, in particular, correcting the channel inventory situation that we're trying to get done with in the Q2 timeframe","Longer term, if you asked me from an overall standpoint, obviously our goal is to grow on an accretive basis the margin opportunities that embedded and server pro graphics affords us as well as a richer mix of business in the client PC space as we introduce new products that we've talked about.","And the other thing I would encourage you to do is we are going the lay out more details from a longer-term standpoint at our Financial Analysts Day that's coming up on May the 6th, and that's where we will share more details in terms of the longer-term model.","Unidentified Participant","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Ragson of Bernstein. Your line is open.","Stacy Ragson - Bernstein","Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I had a question on OpEx. You have a range of $3.40 to $3.70, and that's supposed to be based on the revenue outlook. So, given your revenue trajectory, I'm surprised that you're not taking OpEx down more towards the lower end of that range. Can you tell us, I guess, what products you're investing in and where would revenues actually need to go before you felt the need to take OpEx down to the lower range?","Devinder Kumar","Yes. So if you go back and look at the OpEx, and in particular we were just talking about the enterprise embedded and semicustom area. If you look at the OpEx, first of all, from a Q4 to Q1 standpoint, the OpEx is down. Sales and marketing specifically is down about 9% quarter on quarter. R&D is up slightly. And I can tell you that the R&D, without getting to the specifics, has been targeted towards those areas where we feel afford us the best longer-term opportunities from a growth standpoint and the best opportunities from improving the financial performance standpoint. And obviously we are in a very targeted manner investing in the enterprise, embedded and semicustom area which is where we've had very good traction in 2014. Design wins continue in 2015 with revenue, as Lisa talked about earlier in 2016. And in pursuit of those businesses, we'll go ahead and invest in those areas.","As far as to your question about modulating the expenses in the areas that are more related I guess to the business, CG for example, the revenue is down. I've said many times that we'll modulate our expenses in line with the revenue profile, and even with the sales and marketing decrease quarter of quarter is very much in line with that profile.","However, the one thing I think we have to be mindful about is about the R&D investments. We do want to fund for the future in terms of investing in the product roadmap so that we do not in the short term take action that sacrifice the long-term future both of the Company and the product roadmap. And that's why I think your observation is right, with the revenue down 3% on a guided basis, expenses are flat, but primarily is targeted towards the R&D areas.","Stacy Ragson - Bernstein","Got it, got it. That's helpful. For my follow-up, I had a question I guess on the tree dictionary of the console revenue. So I've got to say I was a little bit surprised at the level of guidance and even in the quarter. Your foundry supplier for consoles [inaudible] consumer revenues in Q1 up quite a bit. And we don't seem to be seeing that in your revenue guide. I know last year we had a bit of a stronger console profile in the first half, and then it was kind of flattish, I think a little lower than what expectations had been in the second half. It sounds like now maybe you're expecting that profile to reverse and you're seeing a stronger console presence in the second half than the first half. Can give us some color based on those drivers on how you see that trajectory moving through the year?","Lisa Su","Yes, Stacy. So we do expect that the, you know, it's hard to call console seasonality as we're, you know, each year is somewhat different. So last year, if you remember, the first half was coming off of a very strong holiday season where there was still let's call it unsatisfied demand. As we go from sort of the second half 2014, into the first half 2015, I think the demand is more normalized. There is an expectation that the second half of 2015 will be stronger in terms of units, and that's what we see from our customers right now. We're very in tune with them in terms of their forecast. And so that's what we see at the moment.","Stacy Ragson - Bernstein","But why would it be stronger? Don't they need to build in front of the holidays?","Lisa Su","They do. But the peak, you know, the peek quarter for semicustom is always going to be the third quarter because that's when they will build ahead of holidays. What we saw in the first half of 2014 was more, I would say, demand that was not satisfied from the previous holiday.","Stacy Ragson - Bernstein","Got it. It's fair to say that the pricing will be down year to year, correct?","Lisa Su","It's fair to say there are some ASP decline, that's correct.","Stacy Ragson - Bernstein","Got it. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland of FBR Capital Markets. Your question please.","Christopher Rolland - FBR Capital Markets","Hey guys, thanks for the question. So the move to Win 10 might be important for you guys, even more important than your competitor given the sort of consumer PC profile there. Also, your competitor has been really backend-loading sales for the year, particularly due to some channel inventory dynamics where we kind of clear the decks to make room for Win 10, and then we have that initial channel build ramp to support Win 10 when it comes out. So I guess first of all, do you guys see the same channel inventory effects? And then also, do you see that same backend-loading of the year as well for PC?","Lisa Su","Sure. So, Chris, what I would say is we do see some of the same dynamics, particularly in the near term as we're going from the first quarter into the second quarter. I do think OEMs are being somewhat cautious on any inventory build now ahead of Win 10. As you go forward into the second half of the year, I think, first of all, I think we're all optimistic that Win 10 can be a catalyst and a driver for the market. However, to what extent will depend on some of the macro conditions that we talked about. I think the currency issues in Europe have to clean up some, I think the Win 10 launch has to be strong, and then we will see how the second half shapes up.","Christopher Rolland - FBR Capital Markets","Okay, great. Your inventory was flat in 1Q. That's probably a quarter where that should have been down. I imagine some of that was maybe to support some upcoming product launches. Then of course you guided inventories up another $100 million next quarter, but you left your 2015 inventory guidance unchanged. So what has to happen there? What are your expectations there to kind of aggressively ramp down inventory into the back half of the year?","Devinder Kumar","So, good question. I think two parts to it. If you go back and look at our inventory profile even in 2014, in particular with the significant revenue we're getting in the semicustom space, the semicustom customers that we have, we have to supply the product for them essentially a quarter ahead of when they build the parts, and therefore the seasonally high sales happen in Q4. We build the product and supply it in Q3, but we have to get the wafer supply and inventory up in Q2. And fundamentally, the increase from Q1 to Q2 is to support the semicustom ramp, as well as what we said earlier about the second half being stronger than the first half. And obviously, we need to be prepared for that.","So I think from an overall standpoint, despite the challenges we talked about in the PC market, managing inventory flat in Q1 was good. And we followed the same profile like we did in 2014, which is our plan. You should see inventory go up during the year to support the ramp of the semicustom and then supplying the product, and at the end of the year being able to manage down to flat inventory year on year.","Christopher Rolland - FBR Capital Markets","Great. Thanks, Devinder.","Devinder Kumar","Welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Hans Mosesmann of Raymond James. Your question please.","Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James","Thanks. Lisa, if you can clarify, in the second half of this year, you expect roughly seasonal trends in the PC-centric parts of your business due to Win 10?","Lisa Su","Yes. So, Hans, I think we would see that the second half would be roughly seasonal. I think we have to see how it fully develops over time.","Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James","Okay. I just wanted to get that, because your competitor is suggesting that it will be stronger than seasonal.","The follow-on question, if I may, can you give us a timeline in terms of Seattle and ARM server ramps and when it becomes relevant or meaningful in terms of sales?","Lisa Su","Yeah, and Hans, I want to just go back to that other question. I would love for it to be greater than seasonal, but I think it's very hard to call at this point in the year.","So, relative to Seattle, Seattle we continued to sample, and customers are continuing to develop both systems and software. Relative to the production ramp for volume shipments, I think we'll see that in the second half of this year.","Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James","Great. Thank you.","Lisa Su","Thanks, Hans.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you for taking my question. Lisa, just a quick clarification. I think you mentioned semicustom wins are -- second -- the revenue is second half 2016. I just want to make sure that wasn't a change from what you had before. And then I had a question.","Lisa Su","Yes, Vivek, it's actually not a change from what we had before. It's probably more specificity. We probably before said 2016, and now it's second half of 2016. It's just a little bit more detail.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And then do you think PC gaming is a growing or a declining market? You mentioned that you expect some share games in the back half. What specifically do you think will help you regain that market share?","Lisa Su","Yes. So thanks for the question, Vivek. That, I do believe PC gaming and gaming in general is a growth opportunity in the market and a growth opportunity for AMD. So as I look forward, we're launching Carrizo on the APU side and we're also launching some graphics products in the second half of this year. So I think from the standpoint of being able to capture more of the market and increase more to where our normal shares are in graphics, I think that's something that we believe we can make progress towards.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And then just one last one for Devinder. Devinder, did you think Q2 cash burn would be better or worse than Q1? And is $1 billion the right level for the wafer supply agreement given your sales outlook in the first half? Take you.","Devinder Kumar","Yes. So first of all, I didn't give a cash guidance for Q2, but what I said specifically is we'll manage within the $600 million to $1 billion balance, the range that we have provided, the target minimum versus the optimal. On the WSA, the $1 billion that we talked about and signed in the WSA that we just confirmed with Global Foundries, that is a mix of revenue there. Just as a reminder, and I think you know this, but the large portion of the amount that we have is a good mix of product across PC, graphics and semicustom, as opposed to if you go back two years ago. So I would say it's very much in line with our expectations of how the market is going to evolve this year, in particular in the semicustom space.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you guys. Good luck.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sanjay Chaurasia of Nomura. Your line is open.","Sanjay Chaurasia - Nomura","Devinder, first question, on the semicustom operating income, it seems like it was significantly below the average of last four, five quarters. I was just wondering if you could highlight where the compression came from and if that goes away in the coming quarters.","Devinder Kumar","Yeah, I think if you look at it from an overall standpoint at the segment level, semicustom being part of the enterprise embedded and semicustom segment, the impact to the operating income in that was really three factors. If you look at the game console royalties based on the Q4 to the Q1 transition, a lower game console royalties and Q1, the product mix obviously had a play in that. And then the other thing that we referenced earlier, and Lisa talked about higher R&D spending the we are targeting more spending in that area to pursue more opportunities and all of those three factors combined caused a lower operating income percentage for the quarter.","Sanjay Chaurasia - Nomura","Okay. And then a follow-up, if I may. Lisa, you made comments on x86-based, several opportunities. And as you put out in your roadmap, I was just wondering if you guys still want to compete the way you had competed with Intel earlier, or are you narrowing your set of opportunities? Any color would be appreciated. Thanks.","Lisa Su","Yes. So Sanjay, I think when we look across our portfolio and our priorities, we are very focused on the places where we can differentiate and innovate. So, relative to x86 opportunities, clearly the x86 server market is a very large market and it is one where we have historically been successful. So I do believe that it's an area that we can grow over the medium term. And when we talk about additional investments in enterprise embedded and semicustom, many of those investments are directed at the server and the embedded markets.","Ruth Cotter","Okay, operator, we'll take the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Yeah, good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Devinder, just a follow-up on the WSA. Do you have a forecast for what payments to Global Foundries might look like in the June quarter? And just help me understand, to get from the run rate in Q1 to kind of the full-year guide of $1 billion, how should we think about kind of the linearity of those payments?","Devinder Kumar","Yeah, I think Q2 amount, I won't get in the quarterly profile, but if you listen to the comments we're making in terms of some of the actions we are taking in Q1 and Q2, the first half of the year, relative to the PC market, and then you listen about the semicustom profile first part of the second half, while the purchases of the first quarter are at the $161 million level, you can expect that it's going to follow the trajectory of the business, second half being stronger than the first half, the semicustom ramp-up in the second half, a significant portion of the billion dollars is semicustom products, and that's exactly how it goes throughout the year.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","That's helpful. And then, Lisa, I guess as my follow-up, granted that it's difficult enough to look out 90 days and have an accurate forecast given the volatility in PCs, let alone the full year. But if you just grow seasonally in the back half of the year, your PC business is going to be down at probably greater than 20% year-over-year for the full year. So I would love to kind of get your sense of what you think the market for PCs is doing this year. Is the gap between that and kind of seasonality share loss, or more importantly, when do you think you're going to be positioned with these products to actually gain back some share in the market?","Lisa Su","Yes. So, John, good question. So for clarification, the comment about the market was really the one on, you know, it's hard to call that the market will be substantially better in the second half than the first half. I think it will be better due to seasonality. Relative to our business, our business certainly in the first quarter and in the second quarter is not really relative to seasonality. I would say we had some inventory issues that I want to correct as soon as possible, so that we get our new product stream fairly clean into the market.","So as we go into the second half of the year, we would like to see some regain of share in both the desktop and the notebook business. I've talked about Carrizo being a strong product for us, I talked about some of our graphics launches that we'll talk about later this quarter. So from our standpoint, I would say the first half of the year, we had some, let's call it, some of our issues that we were correcting in terms of the channel, and then a weaker than expected market environment. In the second half of the year, I think we would like to see our products take a strong position as well as hopefully the market gets stronger as well.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thanks, Lisa. Appreciate it.","Operator","Sorry? Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay of Cannacord. Your line is open.","Matt Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity","Yes, thank you very much for taking my question. Expanding on some of the questions that have been asked in the PC business, declines in share, declines in the market, declines of the inventory and the channel, it looks like for the, I mean give or take for the first half of the year, your PC and -- the computing and graphics business is going to be down maybe 30%, 40% from the first half over first half perspective from last year. Maybe, Lisa, could you help us at all figure out how much of that is due to burning through stuff in channel versus the market being down versus share losses? Any kind of ballpark figures would be really helpful.","Lisa Su","Let's see, Matt. Let me think about the best way to answer that question.","Okay. So let's say it this way. I think we gave you a couple of pointers when we talked about the first quarter year-over-year. We actually saw mobile revenue go up relative to first quarter 2014. Desktop revenue was down. I think from that standpoint, there was a good piece of that desktop reduction that was channel inventory correction, and then some of that was the desktop market being weak.","When we look, you know, when you talk about market share, you're often talking about unit share, and from the standpoint of unit share, we have selectively decided that there are some pieces of business that we're not going to service because they're very unprofitable. And that is some of the share decline that you've seen. Relatively speaking, we've kept ASPs pretty solid, and we would be looking for forward-looking to really improve our mix going forward and getting both the, you know, both the revenue as well as the ASP and mix.","So I know that's not exactly answering your question, but what I'm trying to give you the context for is the desktop market probably took a larger hit first half to first half, just given what's happening in the market in desktops as well as our channel inventory problem. I think the notebook business, we've made some progress, I think we have a very strong product coming out in Carrizo, so we would expect to make more progress.","Matt Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity","And I really do appreciate the color and I think that's helpful. As a follow-up, I wanted to jump into a little industry perspective in the server market. A couple of questions there. One, obviously the decision to exit the SeaMicro business from a platform perspective, maybe could talk a little bit in detail about what's changed there and led to that decision.","And second, it seems a lot of the questions that I hear are focused on the server opportunity as maybe we all think about the server market. But I think what's interesting is also how the line between server and enterprise networking is blurring [ph] a bit through NFC [ph] and FCN [ph]. Maybe talk about some of the opportunities in markets where it's not a traditional AMD versus Intel fight but more new markets that are server TAMs that are opening up as an opportunity for your business. Thanks.","Lisa Su","Yeah, absolutely. So let's talk about investments and priorities. So I've been on the job about six months and I've really been looking at the overall portfolio. Where do we think we can make measurable gains that are sustainable and what the priorities should be? It is clear that we have a lot of technology, but we need to focus our resources on the places that I would say are stickier pieces of business.","So relative to the SeaMicro business, that was a strategic decision to really exit the systems business. And if you think about SeaMicro, it was really specializing in micro-servers. And micro servers have not developed at the pace we might have thought a couple of years ago. From the way we look at the market, our core competency is really in processors and being able to service that business through either standard or semicustom products, is the way we'll address the server business.","Going forward, I think longer-term question, when you look at our IP, whether you talk about our processor IP and some of our packaging and system IP knowhow, I think traditional servers is one place, certainly dense servers, cloud, enterprise are important. And then as you state, the blur between traditional enterprise and networking is there.","So I think we are repositioning our portfolio car. Repositioning the portfolio always takes a bit of time and so we're working through that repositioning. But we will give more color on some of the target markets at the Financial Analysts Day. And certainly Forest Norrod who recently joined us has a lot of thoughts on where we think we can win in these spaces.","Matt Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity","Thank you very much. Look forward to hearing more in a couple of weeks.","Ruth Cotter","Operator, we'll take two more questions please.","Operator","Yes, ma'am. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely of Citigroup. Your question please.","Chris Danely - Citigroup","Hey, thanks for letting me ask a question guys. Lisa, you talked about currency impact in Europe. Can you just elaborate on that, and maybe when you think it's going to stop or stabilize or go away?","Lisa Su","Yeah. So, Chris, we did see the effect of currency in Europe. I guess the way I would describe it is Eastern Europe, just barely, you know, very low demand. We did see that very clearly. Western Europe, actually the demand is okay, but what the currency issues have done is they've resulted in our partners and customers carrying fairly lean inventories just given all of the fluctuation.","I think it's hard to say when it's going to stabilize, but we certainly have clear signals as we look at sell-through on a weekly basis and all of those things.","Chris Danely - Citigroup","Great. And for my follow-up, I guess just a clarification in the WSA. So you said it today in this year. What was it last year? I think it was pretty close to $900 million or $1 billion. And I guess I thought most of that or a good portion of that was CPUs. And given the CPUs are going to be down substantially this year, can you just help me with the math as to how $1 billion works for this year's revenue when it's going to be down substantially?","Devinder Kumar","So I think you're asking about 2014, the WSA I think was about $1.1 billion, so it's slightly lower this year than last year, at the billion dollars level. And the billion dollars is mix of revenue, semicustom, graphics and PC. I talked earlier about purchasing 161 in Q1 and expected purchases will be in line with our business growth in the second half of the year, and obviously you heard the comment about the inventory being up $100 million quarter on quarter from Q1 to Q2 is our anticipation in support of the new product introductions as well as the semicustom ramp in the back half of the year.","Chris Danely - Citigroup","Got it. Okay, thanks, Devinder.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of the Ian Ing of MKM Partners. Your question please.","Ian Ing - MKM Partners","Yes. Thanks for fitting me in. Just some clarifications on the SeaMicro exit. So, for the June question quarter, are there any sequential revenue or gross margin impacts from the exit? And SeaMicro, has that been fully written down at this point or are there any assets or IP that you perhaps can monetize? I know at the time Freedom Fabric looked kind of interesting on the interconnect side.","Devinder Kumar","Yes, I think two-part question. If you look at our GAAP charges that we took in Q1, $87 million, the bulk of that is related to the SeaMicro Systems business exit, $75 million, the bulk of that is non-cash intangible assets, and obviously, there are some severance related activities and expenses that are cash.","As far as Fabric is concerned, the IP is still available for us as needed. But that's the way I would leave it.","Ian Ing - MKM Partners","Okay. And impact on June quarter?","Devinder Kumar","It's already accounted for. We went ahead and booked the expenses. We made the decision to exit the systems business, and those expenses are already accounted for and the charges we took in Q1. So there will be no impact or negligible impact in the Q2 financials to the guidance that we have provided.","Ian Ing - MKM Partners","Okay, understand. And then lastly, currency challenges in the regions. Do you have any sort of natural cost hedging with overseas manufacturing, whether it's front end wafer supply or backend packaging and test that can help out?","Devinder Kumar","Yeah. We have operations both on the engineering side as well as on the manufacturing side in China and Malaysia, engineers in India, China, Canada, and we do the typical hedging programs in terms of forecasted expenses on an OpEx basis and provide an edge there [ph] and had been largely successful in mitigating the impact of the currency overall to the P&L from an OpEx standpoint.","Ian Ing - MKM Partners","Okay. Thanks, Devinder.","Ruth Cotter","Great. Operator, that concludes today's earnings conference call. If you could close the call. And we'd like to thank everybody for participating.","Operator","Thank you, ma'am. And thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation. That does conclude AMD's first quarter conference call.

Dial-in information for the call will be provided publicly in mid-September. Please note, any reference to non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled in the CFO written commentary posted on our website quarterlyearnings.amd.com.","Before we begin today, let me remind everyone that our discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date, and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information. You'll also find detailed discussions about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC, and in particular, AMD's quarterly report on form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2012.","Now with that, I'd like to hand the call over to Rory. Rory?","Rory P. Read","Thank you, Ruth. Clearly, our performance in the quarter was disappointing and did not meet our commitments. When I joined AMD last year, we laid out a set of priorities to improve our execution and transform the company to sustain our long-term growth potential. This has not changed. In spite of the setback in the quarter, we continue to move forward confidently and we are taking the right steps to strengthen and transform our business.","For the second quarter, our revenue of $1.41 billion decreased 10% from a year ago and 11% sequentially, missing our expectations. After a reasonable start, we saw business velocity slow in the later part of the quarter driving this revenue miss. This second quarter revenue shortfall was largely driven by 2 key factors: first, weak sales of desktop processors in the channel, primarily in China and Europe; and secondly, a soft consumer PC market that impacted OEM notebook processor sales. We reacted quickly to this revenue softness by focusing on maintaining margin and effectively managing our expense position. As a result, we reduced expenses sequentially and maintained margin at approximately 46%, generating a net income of $37 million in the quarter.","Looking at the specifics of the desktop business, sales to OEMs increased sequentially based on their continued adoption of APUs. However, our desktop channel revenue declined simply as our Llano product did not experience the same uptake it had with our OEM customers. Looking back, when we were significantly 32-nanometer supply constrained last year, we prioritized shipments of Llano to our OEM customers. As a result, channel partners saw a dramatic change in supply linearity and a misalignment with motherboard availability. This clearly impacted Llano sales and built inventory in the channel.","Correcting our channel challenges with Llano is largely within our own control. Moving forward, we will focus on accelerating desktop channel sell-through, ensure proper supply linearity and more effectively position Llano's value proposition in this area. It is clear that the overall PC market experienced softness in the second quarter, particularly in the consumer space. This impacted our notebook processor business. As the slowdown accelerated late in the quarter, OEMs responded quickly in an effort to reduce their inventory exposure at retailers and limit their on-hand inventories. We made the decision to protect our notebook margin and not chase lower margin business as the environment weakened at the end of the quarter.","While our notebook processor business did not meet our revenue expectations, we did see mobile processor revenue and unit shipments increase from the year-ago period. And Trinity notebook shipments more than doubled sequentially and we have no supply constraints.","We are also seeing good response to the recently launched Trinity systems, including the first Ultrathins from HP and Samsung that hit the mainstream price points. We expect a second wave of Ultrathins will launch in the second half of the year aligned around the Windows 8 introduction. Also, the introduction of Brazos 2.0 helped drive the sixth straight quarter of notebook share gains in the $499 and below retail price band globally. This is a good indicator that our products continue to compete at compelling price points that represent nearly 1\/3 of the overall retail notebook market. We expect that the notebook softness that began in the second quarter will continue in the second half of the year; and while overall notebook market will grow, we anticipate it will be at a lower rate due to third quarter softness in anticipation of Windows 8, the macroeconomic conditions and overall inventory build in the PC ecosystem from the first half. Our record number of design wins remains intact and will help fuel our notebook business through this challenging environment.","Now turning to our server business, revenue increased from the year-ago period but declined sequentially and was below our expectations. With the introduction of our Bulldozer-based Opteron processors at the end of last year, we saw strong initial adoption in the high-performance compute end market. In the second quarter, we experienced a pause in our server business, and our focus has to be on building similar acceptance with mainstream IT buyers. Bulldozer is a solid technology, and as we have discussed previously, our growth opportunities are in the portions of the market where our products deliver clear performance advantages. Based on the competitive landscape, we believe Bulldozer can drive modest share growth in the near term.","In the server space, we also see market expansion opportunities with the growing adoption of dense server technology. We have a differentiated leadership position in this market as a result of our acquisition of SeaMicro. Our IP foundation allows us to deliver disruptive server products and a technology roadmap that strengthens our long-term competitiveness in this emerging market.","Our graphics business executed well, and our results were within historical seasonal patterns. We continued expanding our AMD Radeon 7000 desktop and notebook discrete graphics solutions in the quarter, and we recaptured the title of world's fastest graphics chip and launched the first member of our new workstation family based on our latest graphics core.","It is clear that global economic activity is slowing, and this is impacting the PC market. For the first time since 2001, client PC shipments have declined sequentially for 3 consecutive quarters and have been below historical averages for the last 7 quarters. We expect macro headwinds will continue for the third quarter. We also believe the PC industry may be resetting to a new baseline and that full year industry growth estimates will be reduced.","For the year, we now expect AMD processor unit shipments to grow in the low single digits. AMD will face these current challenges straight on, focused on delivering improved and consistent results. Profitability remains a key priority as we execute the action plans we have discussed here while managing expenses and driving future growth.","We have made progress in building a better AMD. In the second quarter alone, we formed the HSA Foundation with other industry leaders. We announced a technology partnership with ARM to drive the adoption of an end-to-end security ecosystem. We also introduced the world's fastest graphics chip. We released the successor to our most successful platform ever with Brazos 2.0 APU and we launched our next-generation Trinity APU for the mainstream and ultrathin notebooks.","Still, there is much more work to do. We remain steadfast in our efforts to improve our execution and capture the growth opportunities in the changing market landscape around low-power, disruptive server technology and cloud-based computing. As we control our expenses, we will protect our investments and our customer-facing activities and innovations that produce our next generation of relevant competitive products that will drive growth.","There is no doubt that the second quarter was disappointing. But we have the determination and the commitment to deliver improved results. With that, I will turn it over to Thomas, who will cover the financials for the second quarter.","Thomas Seifert","Thank you, Rory. Revenue for the second quarter of 2012 was $1.41 billion, down 11% sequentially, driven primarily by a 13% decline in the Computing Solutions segment. Graphics segment revenue was seasonally down 4%.","Non-GAAP gross margin was 46%, flat sequentially. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $557 million, 8% less than prior guidance, primarily due to lower bonus and commission expenses, as well as discretionary spending cost controls late in the quarter. R&D was $345 million, 24% of net revenue, and SG&A was $212 million, 15% of net revenue.","Non-GAAP net income was $46 million and non-GAAP operating income was $86 million. Interest expense was $43 million, flat compared to the prior quarter. Tax provision was a net credit of $6 million in the quarter compared to $32 million in the prior quarter. The difference was primarily a onetime tax benefit of $36 million in the prior quarter related to the SeaMicro acquisition. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.06, calculated using 755 million fully diluted shares.","Adjusted EBITDA was $173 million, down $48 million from the prior quarter due to lower non-GAAP operating income, which resulted from lower revenue in the quarter.","Computing Solutions segment revenue was $1.05 billion, down 13% sequentially, driven primarily by lower channel sales in China and Europe, as well as the weaker consumer buying environment impacting sales to OEMs. Time product revenue declined 13% sequentially, primarily due to lower ASPs. Units also decreased in the second quarter. Both were primarily driven by lower demand for desktop processors and product mix in channel -- in the channel in China and Europe. Our server processor revenue declined from the prior quarter, mainly due to lower unit shipments and the slight ASP reductions.","Chipset revenue declined in the quarter, primarily due to lower ASPs. Computing Solution operating income was $82 million, down $42 million sequentially, primarily due to lower revenue. Graphics segment revenue was $367 million, down 4% compared to the prior quarter due to seasonally lower unit shipments in the channel. GPU revenue was also down seasonally. Game console royalty revenue was flat sequentially. Graphics segment operating income was $31 million, down $3 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to seasonal declines in the revenue in the quarter.","Turning to the balance sheet, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including long-term securities, ended the quarter at $1.76 billion. In the quarter, we made a $50 million cash payment to GLOBALFOUNDRIES related to the 28-nanometer product limited wafer of exclusivity.","Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter was $744 million, down $218 million compared to the end of the first quarter of 2012 due primarily to lower revenue. Inventory was $833 million exiting the quarter, up $248 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to lower sales in the quarter and in preparation for previously anticipated demand. The inventory build consists primarily of our latest generation of products.","Debt at the end of the quarter was unchanged at $2.02 billion.","Now turning to the outlook, AMD expects third quarter revenue to decrease 1% sequentially, plus or minus 3%. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 44%. Operating expenses are expected to be approximately $560 million in the third quarter. We are working to match revenue and expenses to manage profitability and ensure we have the appropriate cost structure from which to grow and one that allows us to continue to make the necessary strategic product and roadmap investments. Our goal for the third quarter inventory is to be approximately flat sequentially. However, we'll need to carefully manage and focus on this as we transition throughout the quarter and monitor how our latest generation of products will gain traction in the marketplace as our customers prepare for the Windows 8 launch.","We're disappointed by the softness in our business late in the second quarter and are now focused on stabilization and recovery. Protecting the value proposition of our new and refreshed product portfolio in the second half of the year is paramount in conjunction with continued profitability. Despite the ongoing challenges our general business faces, the choppy macro environment and some lackluster PC demand, I am confident we will succeed and be ready to capitalize on the Windows 8 launch, better inventory management and realize the ongoing value proposition of our APUs.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Ruth.","Ruth Cotter","Thank you, Thomas. Operator, if you could now poll the audience please for the question-and-answer session?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first questioner in queue is Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.","Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Rory, would you mind going through the mechanism that occurred in the channel in terms of the mismatch between motherboards with the Llano? I got a little confused in terms of what may have happened and how you can fix that here over the next several months.","Rory P. Read","Sure, Hans. From a standpoint, this originated back in last year when we had that first Llano supply chain issue. And of course, you know, Hans, that we had to target our supply to our OEMs, and that was the right thing to do. As we introduced Llano late in the year to the channel that those motherboards had been there for some period of time and really damaged linearity, and pricing wasn't at the right levels as we exited the year. As we moved forward into 2012, the uptake on Llano in the channel wasn't as strong as we expected. And what we're doing here moving forward, Hans, is we're focused on improving and focusing on sellout activity throughout the tiers of the channel, improving the communication of our value proposition into this key segment and to make sure that we make -- deliver on this momentum in the desktop channel around linearity with our channel partners. Does that help, Hans?","Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes. Just to confirm, so the uptake in the channel was due to a sudden availability of Llano, or had the motherboards been already kind of designed for another processor?","Rory P. Read","No, the mismatch occurred early in the cycle as we went through this in terms of they were introduced to the channel earlier in the cycle. Then as the Llano product came in late in the year of 2012, there was a mismatch in terms of the pricing, et cetera. This impacted linearity. And then we didn't enjoy the same uptake that we saw around Llano that we saw with our OEMs.","Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I see, okay. And then as a follow-up, in terms of market -- you very likely lost market share as a result of that. But do you believe in notebooks? How is the situation market share-wise there in microprocessors?","Rory P. Read","I believe that we lost market share in the quarter. I don't think there's any doubt about that. In the channel, we talked about in the earlier comments about how we're going to focus to improve that going forward. In the OEM space, in the notebook space, our value proposition, our product set is strong with the APUs. I believe that in that segment, we've got to continue to focus on building that momentum with the key OEMs and to make sure that they see this next generation of APUs make the impact that we believe it will have. We've seen Trinity APUs double sequentially in terms of its volume. We've seen our early releases of our first Ultrathins with HP and Samsung. These are hitting mainstream price points and they're being well-accepted. And then around Brazos 2.0, the next-generation to our most successful platform ever of Brazos, we have now had again for the sixth quarter in a row, the leadership growth in terms of the $499 and below price band across the planet. That shows that those products are competitive, they are compelling and we're going to continue to stay the course on that set.","Operator","Next questioner in queue is Glen Yeung with Citi.","Adeline Lee","It's Adeline for Glen Yeung. Can you tell us a little bit about what your debt reduction plans are regarding the debt due in August?","Thomas Seifert","Yes, let me take this question. It's Thomas. As I have said previously, we are very comfortable paying the debt off using cash from our balance sheet on the August maturities. But in addition, we continue, of course, now to monitor the markets closely to explore potential opportunities. I believe our strong balance sheet has allowed us to post organically and via acquisitions, and we want to maintain such a strong balance sheet moving forward, especially given the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. And ensure that way that we are in a position to invest according to our plans.","Adeline Lee","And a follow-up, can you tell us a little bit about how you can retake share in the server market?","Rory P. Read","From a server standpoint with the introduction of the Opteron Bulldozer product, we saw a good uptake in the initial launch around the high-performance compute segment. There is no doubt that, that success is a good foundation and showed our early progress there. We've communicated before that we need to leverage our Opteron Bulldozer solution, which is a solid technology on the key workloads and the key customer segments where we enjoy a performance advantage. This is key. And we'll continue to build that where we can add modest share gains quarter-on-quarter, quarter-after-quarter. And now, we're also pleased with the progress that we're seeing around our SeaMicro acquisition. SeaMicro positions us with strong IP and a strong offering in the new emerging dense server computing area. And I think this is a very important opportunity as I believe this will expand the market as we move forward. Lisa, do you have any comments on how SeaMicro is going so far?","Lisa T. Su","Just to add to Rory's comments on the server business, so the SeaMicro, we closed that acquisition at the end of the first quarter and they've been part of us. For the second quarter, I would say the integration has gone very smoothly, and we've been pleased with the capability and the talents that the team have brought onboard. We continue to have very positive conversations with customers about the technology, and we view this as a long-term growth path, in addition to obviously the near-term work on our Opteron based series, which we believe, as Rory said, has the opportunity to continue to grow.","Operator","The next questioner in queue is David Wong with Wells Fargo.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","What do you expect to be the ratio of Trinity versus Llano sales in the September quarter?","Rory P. Read","We wouldn't get into those specifics in terms of communicating, but clearly, we've already launched the Trinity activities with our notebook OEM partner and we'll continue to build that. That doubled sequentially. Llano is an important product throughout the balance of this year and into 2013. It's very relevant to leverage both of those solutions as we move forward, and we'll continue to do that.","Operator","Next questioner in queue is Uche Orji with the UBS.","Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just real quick, I just wanted to clarify the weakness in desktops. Was it just CPU? Was it also a problem with graphics in desktop channel products?","Rory P. Read","Graphics enjoyed -- had a solid quarter. It was within seasonal expectation and history. We saw good performance out of our next-generation 28-nanometer products and we have strong supply there. We did not see issues in terms of the graphics space in terms of that, where the big issue in terms of the quarter, and that is largely in our control, is around the Desktop business in the channel around CPUs and around the APU product. We did not see the same uptick, as I talked about earlier, uptake that we saw with the OEMs. And it's interesting, Uche, in the OEMs, we've done very well with Llano in terms of notebook and in desktop at the OEMs. So I believe that we've not done a good job in terms of linearity and managing our supply to our partners, communicating the strong value proposition deeper into the channel and to ensure that our promotions are focused on sell out to drive this launch. And that's what we're going to focus on in 3Q and 4Q.","Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful. Just very quickly, if I were to look at how you -- if we look ahead into Intel introducing Haswell products and one other things we expect from the product is much lower power from their architecture. There are 2 questions I have. One is how do you position Trinity on Kaveri out there? But what's even more worrying for me is how do you think that as Ivy Bridge or even as a Sandy Bridge today rolls into the N minus 1 rolls into the value segment? Are we seeing a significant shift in terms of the competitive positioning of both companies? Or do you think that the way you position yourself you can actually compete in what I think is an interesting change from your competitor in terms of product rollout?","Rory P. Read","Uche, I want to emphasize that I believe firmly that we're on the right strategy. This execution in second quarter is disappointing. And we will correct it. But I firmly believe that we're on the right strategy around our APU technology, around cloud computing and enhancing our low-power solutions. This is the right strategy and the right differentiation for AMD. AMD is going to continue to deliver interesting and differentiated products that leverage this cloud environment and lower our power envelope and introduce an interesting value proposition to our customers moving forward. Lisa, some comments?","Lisa T. Su","Yes, Uche, maybe let me add some color to that. So definitely, the APUs are our strategy, and we're very pleased with the value proposition that we have there, especially in notebook and especially as you go into the low-power space. So when you look at any of the comparisons on Trinity and the battery life that we have on those APUs, very good improvement over the previous generation. As we go forward, we're going to continue to focus on this strategy and as we go into the next-generation APUs, similar focus on getting longer battery life, thinner, lighter, those areas. So the APUs were our initial strategy and they continue to be where we believe we're going to be able to differentiate going forward.","Rory P. Read","Also, Uche, it's very important to take part of our strategy that we've talked about and we've talked about with you is the idea to expand and take the APUs into adjacent segments around the embedded areas. We think that offers a very attractive opportunity for us moving forward, and I believe this is the proper focus.","Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That's great. And just one last question. Your engagements with mega data centers in terms of your Server business, has been area where it's a little not clear what the strategy is. Some of the products you've rolled out recently have had fairly good reviews. Are you starting to -- how do you think you might start to change or shift the perception from this kind -- and engage this kind of customers, especially given that today, that's seems to be duly -- categorically, they seem to be spending a lot of money now.","Lisa T. Su","Yes, Uche, this is certainly a very good point. We like the mega data center market. It is the fastest-growing market in the server business. As we've discussed before, the server business is the one that takes a little bit longer to actually see product adoption. But we're very focused with both our Opteron product line as well as our SeaMicro products with the fiber-based technology in attacking those mega data centers. And lots of customer conversations in those areas.","Operator","The next questioner in queue is JoAnne Feeney with Longbow Research.","JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC","I have a question about the gross margin dynamics, Thomas. Could you explain the moving parts for the second quarter given that ASPs were down on I assume lower channel must be yield improvement I suspect? And third quarter, what's happening there?","Thomas Seifert","Yes, so let's start with the second quarter. So we guided for 46% to slightly up and we ended up right there, mainly driven by the right product mix, good share of gaming royalty revenue and very good improvements on the productivity side in terms of cost of goods sold, yield and other measures beyond yield. That helped us to end up in a good space despite the challenges we saw on the revenue side. If you look at guidance now for the third quarter, there are certain headwinds and tailwinds you have to keep in mind. I think we are going to continue to see productivity improvements, we also will see tail wind by a higher share of Trinity products getting into the market, and then we will see some headwinds. We will have lesser royalty income in the third quarter from a gaming perspective. We see additional cost in terms of having the full impact of our 28-nanometer portfolio hit us from a ramp-up perspective, and we will see some pressure from a pricing perspective in those parts of the business that Rory has been talking about, where we have to show velocity in order to move the channels. And I think this is getting us in the space that I have guided for.","JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, and then as a follow-up with regard to inventories, can you describe a little bit the mix of inventories? Is this because of a shortfall in Llano sales, primarily Llano-based? And if so, what gives you confidence that the channel is going to continue to be enthusiastic for Llano when they know Trinity desktop is right around the corner? Is that really part of it, that the channel just doesn't like to be second place to the OEMs in terms of getting the new products and really just want to wait for Trinity at this point?","Thomas Seifert","Yes, so let me start with the inventory mix first and how we look at that and then Lisa and Rory can comment on the velocity in the channel. The inventory build comes really in 2 parts. We -- to be very honest, we had planned for certain inventory increase anyway in preparation for the second half. So I think about half of their -- the increase is really only attributable to the demand shortfall. And the good news is that the inventory is pretty much all current products and the part where we saw demand shortfall is pretty much driven by Llano. We feel confident and our aim, of course, is as I said before in my script that we try to manage inventory slightly quarter-over-quarter, but we have to carefully manage the transition of the new products and how the demand environment is going to change. And regarding velocity, Lisa?","Lisa T. Su","Yes, let me make a couple comments on that. So Llano is a good product. If you look at where we're selling, it's selling into both notebook and desktop OEMs as well as the channel. We got ourselves a bit out of position admittedly and that's a big reason for our shortfall. But when we look forward, it's really the focus on sellout velocity and getting the overall positioning correct with both the CPUs as well as the motherboards. And we think we're doing that. Trinity will also be an excellent product that will go into the channel and I think we will run with both products for some time in the channel.","JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, and when you refer to positioning being a bit off, is this mismatch that you and Rory have talked about referring primarily to pricing or to the allocation of different qualities of Llano to different particular channel partners?","Lisa T. Su","Yes, it's really the -- where we had motherboard supply relative to CPU supply and the resulting nonlinearity in the channel.","JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, and then -- I'm sorry, I think that's something Thomas said. You said Trinity is expected to be a greater share of revenues in the third -- in this quarter? And is that relative to Brazos or relative to both Brazos and in Llano?","Thomas Seifert","It's -- I'm not going to go into that detail. It's going to have -- it's going to increase velocity. We have increasing volume and it's part of a higher share overall of Trinity as part of our product mix. We will have a tailwind in the gross margin development.","Operator","Next questioner in queue is Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So it sounds like you're going to get a little more aggressive on price to clear out the inventory at AMD and in the channel. How long do you think it will take to clear it out? And then if you could just talk about gross margin plans beyond Q3 and the impact that, that would have on this as well.","Rory P. Read","We've seen a slowdown obviously in the overall consumer spending and global marketplace. And that's obviously impacted the PC segment. I believe we'll see forecasts from IDC and Gartner continue to be reduced in the second half. Based on that, we have to make sure that we're positioning our products properly and that we execute the plans around inventory burn off, as well as introduction of new products. So I believe that macroeconomics will cause some slowdown and obviously will make us focus on executing that business more assertively. In the desktop channel, I believe that's more around our control. I think we executed not as effectively as we could have and I believe that we did not enjoy that same uptake in that channel space. We will make sure that our promotions and our incentives are focused around sales out and that our marketing communications help build the understanding deeper into Tier 2, 3 and 4 in the channel to make sure that we get that velocity.","Thomas Seifert","With respect to margin, we're here today to talk about Q3, and I'm not going to provide guidance on Q4 margin. With that being said, we gave guidance for the full year in the range of 44% to 48%, and we are well within this range at this point.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And can you just give me -- give us an estimate on how long it will take to get your inventory and the channel inventory back to a level where you feel comfortable?","Rory P. Read","We're going to work on that in 3Q and in the second half of the year. We believe that, that's the right focus and we'll work through that in each of those next 2 quarters. We believe that we'll track that week-on-week and ensure that we have that right focus.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then just as my quick follow-up, when do you think we can start to see the -- you guys regaining shares show up in the numbers? Like Q4 or do you think we're looking at next year?","Rory P. Read","Our objective is to gain share in every quarter, and that's going to be our focus going forward. Obviously, there's headwinds in terms of the macro environment, our channel development. But we have interesting products that hit the right point with our customers and value propositions that make sense. We have to focus our entire team across AMD to get that share growth objective in each quarter. We'll work that each of the next several quarters and that's clearly our objective.","Operator","Next questioner in queue is Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","First, a question on your take-or-pay arrangement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES How does the lower demand outlook that you're looking at now actually affect that take-or-pay given I thought that you were supposed to give them a forward 12-month fixed forecast? What impact has that actually had on your inventory build? What impact will that have going forward? And what impact did that actually have in your gross margins, given that you've already apparently committed to those forward purchases?","Rory P. Read","First, I'd like to comment on our relationship with GLOBALFOUNDRIES. And I want to personally acknowledge the progress they've made over the past several quarters in improving their execution. We're building a stronger partnership, where every week we're at ongoing dialogues with them in terms of how to improve yield, how to deliver the supply and improve our businesses going forward. We've seen significant progress from GLOBALFOUNDRIES and their execution has improved dramatically year-over-year.","Thomas Seifert","So with that being said, Stacy, their -- the commitment is pretty much a 2012 commitment and not so much a from here on 12 months moving forward commitment. And both companies are very focused on making sure that we have a mutually successful business arrangement and in light of a weakening PC environment, we are in discussions, of course, not only with GLOBALFOUNDRIES but with all of our foundry partners and with all of our suppliers, as a matter of fact, in order to make sure that we manage inventory correctly in the light of the weakening demand environment to be very honest. This is not so much a matter of gross margin, it's much more a matter of inventory and cash, how you have to look at this topic.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Yes, but if you have too much inventory eventually, if you've got to discount it to get rid of it, it hits gross margin. So are you still going to be committed to accepting your 2012 forecast as you gave it to them at the beginning of the year under the way the agreement is currently written?","Thomas Seifert","As I said, we are in discussions with all of our foundry partners to make sure that we manage inventory responsible and working capital responsible in light of their demand environment as it has developed late in the second quarter.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Got it. And for my follow-up, just 2 quick ones, OpEx, at what point or what revenue levels do we start to see OpEx start to grow again? When do bonuses and everything else start to come back? And how does -- I guess the weaker outlook right now temper or not your investment needs as you ramp into more of the HSA products into 2013 and beyond? And one more quick one, do you think you'll be free cash flow positive in Q3 and Q4 of this year?","Thomas Seifert","So let me start with the operating expenses first. I think we have shown a very disciplined approach over the last quarters, how we can manage our operating expenses. And this is, of course, an approach that we continue to exercise as we move forward, especially in light of a weaker demand environment. And the controls and the processes that we have put in place so far have allowed us to react fast and swift to the shortfall in demand in the second quarter. And those principles will guide us how we manage aggressively operating expenses moving forward, always keeping in mind that we protect and safeguard the investments from the roadmap perspective that secure our future. There's no doubt that we protect those investments. And we've been talking a lot in the past on the initiatives we had started that allow us to generate this productivity in order to realize those benefits. So very disciplined moving forward, very strict moving forward, but protecting our future. And operating expense guidance for the third quarter is as it is and we will take it from there depending where the demand environment is going to take us.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And free cash flow in Q3 and Q4, positive?","Thomas Seifert","For Q4, I'm not going to provide guidance. For the third quarter, our free cash flow is going to be driven pretty much by the revenue we have seen in the prior quarter in Q2 plus the linearity we are going to experience through the course of the current quarter. We are not far enough into the quarter to see how that is developing yet. And that's why it's difficult to make a statement in that perspective. Of course, we are running at high chip. You can see that in the second quarter not only from on a cost -- from a cost perspective but also from a free cash flow perspective. And we'll try to maintain this, of course, as we move through the current quarter.","Operator","Next questioner in queue is Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Did you quantify how far above normal you thought channel inventories had gotten or how far above normal they are now?","Rory P. Read","No, we didn't get into those specifics. We -- as I mentioned earlier in my comments, we believe that the expectation in the PC market was across 2012 at the beginning of the year was to be expanding each quarter. And as you could see in 2Q, the macroeconomic headwinds have obviously slowed that PC growth. We believe that will continue in the second half. And based on that, we think there's pressure in the entire ecosystem of the PC environment moving forward. We believe that the right focus is to be very disciplined in our execution around that channel management and to create our promotional focus and dollar investment around driving sellout activities, but we did not give any specifics.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","It's fair. Am I fair to assume that they're above normal right now?","Rory P. Read","Yes, absolutely. We said that. That's fair.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then the -- are you talking about the channel marketing programs? Your OpEx is flat. So is this -- is the increased budget in the channel programs, does that come from an improved efficiencies or do you just shift marketing programs from OEMs to the channel? Is that how that works?","Thomas Seifert","Yes, we are not going to go into that much detail, but of course, we generate productivity and we are flexible in how we allocate dollars with under the umbrella and within the boundaries that we have guided for.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Fair enough. And last question, 28-nanometer APU, I guess my understanding was that this would -- you would start production this year and start shipping next year. Does that still sound reasonable?","Lisa T. Su","Yes, so on the 28-nanometer, we are shipping 28-nanometer graphics this year and we will be shipping 28-nanometer APUs next year in 2013.","Operator","Next questioner in queue is Cody Acree with Williams Financial.","Cody G. Acree - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","Rory, if we could take a step back, so we've got about, what a 14% differential from the original guide. Could you give as much color as you can as maybe the rankings to whatever weight you can give? You've got several things impacting everything from inventory correction to share loss to price pressure and just shifts in the macro to -- how did that 14% came about?","Rory P. Read","Yes, from my perspective, as I've shared earlier, there's really 2 key drivers around that. Obviously, the soft PC market that impacted processor sales, that's a market phenomena. We think that affected the market in general. I'd say that's an important factor in terms of the impact and the revenue impact late in the quarter. And then obviously, the weak sales of desktop processor in the channel, which again manifested itself first in China, late in the quarter and then it spread across the globe. I think that the channel impact had more of an impact in terms of the revenue in the quarter, but obviously, both were significant.","Cody G. Acree - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","From a pricing standpoint and was that outside of the channel, do you think that, that had an impact in those [indiscernible]?","Rory P. Read","Cody, can you repeat it? You got muffled on that part. Didn't hear you clearly.","Cody G. Acree - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","Yes, just from a pricing competition standpoint, how much did that factor into this just not maybe a soft to -- and to what is sitting out in the channel?","Rory P. Read","From our perspective, we saw these impacts in terms of linearity, the channel situation and then the softness in the market. That rippled through the entire market. You've seen feedback from some of the players in the ecosystem communicating that. We -- as the quarter deteriorated, we made the conscious decision to not chase those bad deals late in the quarter. And I think that was the right decision.","Cody G. Acree - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","I guess, Rory, as you look forward then, to what extent do you think that, that pricing decline continues and maybe accelerates. I guess when you look at what Intel is doing is they're making a transition from one process to the other, what do you expect from a pricing environment, not just this quarter but as we finish the year?","Rory P. Read","Yes, I don't think there is any doubt that the market will face headwinds in terms of the macro impact. And I think it will be more centered around consumer than other parts of the market. Given that, I do think the market and PC notebooks will expand in the second half, although at a muted level. I also think that everyone remains excited about Win 8. It's now been documented when that launch will be. That's important because we'll introduce those products into third quarter and get those shelves ready to go as we go into 4Q. And that should offer some opportunity. But clearly, that overall softness and weakness is part of the focus that Thomas talked about when we gave the guidance around 3Q and the actions we'll take to move forward.","Cody G. Acree - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","I guess then lastly, Rory, are you prepared to get more aggressive to chase product maybe you weren't ready to take at the end of Q2?","Rory P. Read","Our focus has to be around profitability and profitable growth. Profitability allows us to continue to invest in the company and the areas that help us grow and build the company over time. We're going to focus on profitability. Of course, we need top line and a combination of that. But again, we made the conscious decision to manage the expense, run a tight ship, make the decisions around those activities. And while we're taking actions to improve sales velocity in the channel to make sure that we capture the notebook growth in the second half, our primary focus is to continue to deliver a profitable engine moving forward even in this difficult environment.","Operator","Next questioner in queue is Kevin Cassidy with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Dean Grumlose - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Well, this is Dean Grumlose calling in for Kevin. Looking forward on manufacturing strategy. Could you please explain your thoughts around your options and choices of fab flexibility versus optimizing performance? Meaning to what degree will you need -- do you believe you'll need them to a very small set of foundry partners in order to achieve competitive performance?","Rory P. Read","Today, we have a foundry relationship with 2 industry leaders in the space. And as I mentioned earlier, GLOBALFOUNDRIES has done a very strong job of improving their execution. They've delivered across 2012, addressed the challenges they had last year and the partnership that we are building with them is very positive. And I feel optimistic of that relationship and improvement that they've made. As I mentioned earlier, we've also seen strong work out of our other foundry activities, around graphics. That 28-nanometer implementation has allowed us to deliver a solid quarter in our graphics business again. So we believe we have the right mix at this time.","Thomas Seifert","And we also said in the past that the number of foundries we can support or can support us is also a function of the overall size the company has. With the size we have to -- that we have today, it's difficult to see that we could add a third partner.","Operator","Next questioner in queue is Vivek Arya with Bank of America.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm wondering how discrete the graphics market share trended. Your competitor did launch a new product. You also had new products. So how did the market share evolve in the last quarter and how do you see it evolving in the second half of the year?","Rory P. Read","From our standpoint, I think it's important to acknowledge again we recaptured the position of the world's fastest graphics chip. And again, the -- within the quarter, a solid quarter within seasonality. Lisa, any comments you'd like to offer around graphics?","Lisa T. Su","No, I would say that we're pleased with our graphics performance from a competitiveness standpoint. We did launch in the last couple of weeks a very strong offering to get to the gigahertz level with our Radeon series. So we continue to believe that this is a very strong product portfolio for us.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, any comments on market share? Do you have any sense for that now or...","Lisa T. Su","I think we have to wait until the numbers come out.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And a different question, Rory, I'm curious what do you think about how close or far is the ARM ecosystem in becoming a real threat to you in the low end of the PC market?","Rory P. Read","It's interesting, Vivek. Based on my experience in the marketplace as a leader in the OEM segment, we've looked at that for a long time in my previous experience as well as in this current one. And as I look at the velocity of the business and I look at the market as it's evolving here, I think ARM in the client space will be muted for some period of time. I believe that the performance out of the x86 offerings as well as forward and backward compatibility offer an intriguing value proposition at very attractive price points. And I believe we'll be able to continue to build on that marketplace as we go forward. Do I think ARM will make progress in the PC segment over time? I do. But I think that's in the 3-plus year time frame to really see it make significant progress.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And just lastly, Rory, do you think Windows 8 tablets changed the game in any way or Windows 8 RT specifically, do they change the game in any way?","Rory P. Read","Sure, so from a standpoint, obviously we've seen softness in the second quarter. It's driven primarily by macroeconomic issues. We've seen it manifest itself more assertively in the consumer segment. But there's no doubt in some of the mature markets that tablet had some impact. It is not a significant portion, but it is a portion. As we look forward, the Windows introduction of tablet offers interesting opportunities as we move forward. And I do believe that Windows tablets will make progress over the next 1, 2, 3 years and ultimately could enjoy as much as 20% market share in that time period.","Operator","Next questioner in queue is Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.","Gabriel Ho","This is Gabriel for Ambrish. Just wondering what is the ASP trend for the MPU for the discrete graphics? That's the first question. For the desktop and notebook.","Thomas Seifert","In the second quarter, in the third quarter?","Gabriel Ho","In the third quarter and going forward.","Rory P. Read","We wouldn't break out that level of detail around those specific numbers or ASPs.","Gabriel Ho","Okay. And next question would be do you have any comment on the channel? Actually, do you have some sense of what kind of like finishing in terms of nano or Trinity versus your competitor?","Rory P. Read","Well, as I've covered several times around the channel, I think we've articulated where the issue is around the uptake around the Llano business in the channel and I believe that our focus around the 3 core actions to improve linearity. As you know, the channel partners make money based on their terms of their business and return on capital. You must have strong linearity. Second program, make sure we focus on the promotions that drive sell out, lower into the second and third tier of the channel. And then finally, make sure we're educating and training the channel on the value proposition we offer. It's interesting because Llano has enjoyed a strong uptake with our OEM customers and in both notebook and desktop. And we've seen a sequential improvement of our Llano desktop business with OEM, which we -- which says we need to do a better job of articulating that in the channel.","Operator","Next questioner in queue is Craig Berger with FBR Capital.","Craig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I guess one of my questions is when is the product that you feel you have a heavy hand in developing going to be coming to market?","Rory P. Read","All of the products we develop are part of our technology team here that's in place. If you're referring to based on new leadership and management team, semiconductor development occurs over a 24 to 30-month time period. But all of the products here are products that we are delivering from AMD.","Craig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And then can you just go over the timing of cash payments to short-term debt and GLOBALFOUNDRY?","Thomas Seifert","So as I said before, we have made $50 million payment the current quarter. So there remains $225 million to go. And this will be paid completely down by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year '13.","Craig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And is there a short-term debt due in the next year also?","Thomas Seifert","Short-term debt in the sense of the maturities that are going to be due in August, there's $485 million. That is what I referred to with the earlier question on how we want to handle this. And then the next maturity tower is coming up in 2015.","Operator","Our final question comes from Mike McConnell, Pacific.","Michael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Yes, I was just curious with the outlook for Q3. Will -- both computing and graphics both be down commensurate or will one be -- will there be growth in graphics relative to a larger decline in computing?","Rory P. Read","Clearly, Mike, again we're disappointed with the performance of the business in Q2. And as we look forward, there's no doubt that the macroeconomic headwinds will dampen the second half progress in the overall PC market. But having said that, I do believe that notebook will expand in the second half. And that's an opportunity for us to target our differentiated next-generation APUs to capture that growth. While I expect it to be muted and lower than current expectation in the market, I do believe that's going to be an area of growth. We have strength in terms of our graphics business and our offerings, but we have to make sure that we're driving that business as we go forward around future design wins and future generations of our technology.","Michael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","So units up in both and ASPs will be the reason for the decline?","Rory P.

Lisa?","Lisa T. Su - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Ruth, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. As we announced last week, second quarter revenue and gross margin decreased more than we initially guided as the consumer PC market became decidedly weaker following our Financial Analyst Day. The softer than expected consumer PC demand in advance of the Windows 10 launch caused our OEM notebook sales to slow late in the quarter, as our OEM customers and retailers actively work through their inventory of Windows 8-based systems.","This significantly impacted our second quarter PC notebook sales and reduced our gross margin as we ended the quarter with a larger mix of lower gross margin EESC revenue. Despite our Computing and Graphics revenue shortfall, our other businesses performed largely as expected. We also made some good progress during the quarter as we introduced several key new products, secured multiple embedded design wins across our target markets and continued to see strength in our Semi-Custom business.","Computing and Graphics segment revenue decreased 29% sequentially, based on soft consumer demand. This also impacted sales of our 6th Generation A-Series APU, code name Carrizo, as some OEMs chose to align Carrizo launches with the Windows 10 launch. We expect our mobile unit shipments will rebound and ramp in the second half of the year as more than 35 Carrizo platforms come to market globally.","In the channel, we saw a sequential increase in desktop processor revenue due to solid demand for our FX processors and our A-Series APUs. We also reduced downstream inventory levels in the quarter largely completing our multi-quarter channel rebalancing effort.","GPU revenue decreased sequentially in line with seasonality. We did see good initial demand for our new 300 Series GPUs and latest flagship Radeon R9 Fury X, which launched late in the quarter and contributed to a sequential improvement in GPU channel revenue and ASP. Fury X is powered by our Fiji GPU, the industry's first graphics chip to feature die-stacked high-bandwidth memory, which can deliver unprecedented performance in an extremely quiet and compact graphics card. We are pleased with the initial ramp-up of our Fiji GPUs and will expand our industry-leading HBM GPU offerings in the coming quarters as we introduce the Fury, Nano and a high-end duel Fiji GPU card.","We also strengthened our management team, as Jim Anderson joined us to lead our Computing and Graphics business group. Jim began his career as a processor architect and has held several leadership, business management and engineering roles across multiple technology companies. He is the ideal leader to return CG to a positive trajectory as we focus on stabilizing the business and then regaining profitable share.","Looking at our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment; revenue increased 13% sequentially driven by strong Semi-Custom sales. We remain on track to set a record for annual Semi-Custom unit shipments this year. As in 2014, we anticipate the third quarter will be our annual peak for Semi-Custom shipments and revenue, based on Sony and Microsoft building inventory in advance of the holiday period. We also began development of a new Semi-Custom design in the quarter. Like our other Semi-Custom designs, the details are customer confidential, but we are pleased with our progress continuing to expand our customer base in this important part of our business.","Looking forward, we believe the second quarter will be our revenue trough for the year, based on stronger second half demand for game consoles, combined with the ramp of our newest APU and GPU products, and OEM demand improving as the market transitions to Windows 10. That said, the PC market remains volatile. We must further align our cost structure with our revenue profile, as we focus on our strongest market opportunities and continue investing in the high-performance Computing and Graphics technologies that can enable us to create great products and reestablish AMD as a leader across our target markets.","As we discussed at our Financial Analyst Day in May, our focus is to expand margins and improve our cash flow generation by gaining profitable share across the gaming, immersive devices and data center markets over the next three years to five years. We are fully committed to pursuing this strategy as we create a more diversified AMD capable of generating consistent, profitable returns independent of the ebbs and flows of a single market.","AMD is at its best when we deliver leading edge technology, based on taking bold calculated risks that leverage our differentiated IP and design capabilities to create unique products that make our customers incredibly successful. This is where we are focused. Despite the near-term pressures, we have the right strategy to improve AMD's financial results.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our second quarter financial performance. Devinder?","Devinder Kumar - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will be referencing non-GAAP figures, except for revenue which is on a GAAP basis. As Lisa discussed, second quarter results reflect the weaker than expected consumer PC market, which impacted demand from our OEM customers. Our EESC segment revenue was up, our channel inventory corrective actions are largely completed, and although our channel sales came in as expected, up from the prior quarter, it was not enough to offset the impact on our PC OEM processor business.","Second quarter revenue was $942 million, down 8% sequentially, primarily driven by lower sales to our PC OEM customers. The year-over-year decline of 35% was largely driven by decreased sales across our Computing and Graphics products. Gross margin was 28%, down four percentage points from the prior quarter, primarily due to a higher mix of Enterprise, Embedded, Semi-Custom segment revenue and lower than anticipated Computing and Graphics segment, notebook APU unit volumes. Additionally, our GAAP gross margin was affected by a $33 million technology node transition charge.","Operating expenses in the second quarter were $353 million, down $4 million from the prior quarter. Operating loss was $87 million and net loss was $131 million, or $0.17 per share, calculated using 778 million shares. Net interest expense, other expense and taxes were $44 million in the quarter, up from $43 million in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $42 million, down from a positive $13 million in the prior quarter, and on a trailing four quarter adjusted base \u2013 adjusted EBITDA was $200 million.","Now, turning to the business segments; Computing and Graphics revenue was $379 million, down 29% sequentially, primarily due to decreased sales of our client notebook processors due to a weak consumer PC market, impacting our sales to OEMs. Channel PC processor and graphics sales were in line with the company's expectations. Computing and Graphics operating loss was $147 million, compared to a $75 million loss in the prior quarter, primarily due to lower notebook processor sales. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $563 million, up 13% from the prior quarter, driven by higher sales of our Semi-Custom SoCs. Operating income of this segment was $27 million, down from $45 million in the prior quarter, due to the $33 million technology node transition charge.","Turning to the balance sheet; our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balance totaled $829 million at the end of the quarter, down $77 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to lower sales in the quarter. Inventory was $799 million, up from $688 million in the prior quarter, in line with expectations in support of Semi-Custom holiday season sales in the second half of 2015, and due to lower sales of our client products driven by a weak consumer PC market. Debt as of the end of the quarter was $2.27 billion, flat from the prior quarter. This includes an additional $42 million draw on our ABL facility which was utilized to extinguish our 6% convertible senior notes that came due in May 2015. With the final payoff of our 2015 debt tower (11:50), there are no term debt maturities due until 2019. Free cash flow in the quarter was negative $75 million, an improvement of $120 million from the prior quarter.","Now turning to the outlook; at our Financial Analyst Day in May, we provided a view of our business in the second half of the year and an overview of the drivers that we believe would return AMD to profitability in the back half of the year. However, late in the second quarter, our OEM client PC demand was lower, triggered by the impact of the Windows 10 launch and inventory re-profiling by our OEM customers. Due to the shift in the PC market, we are now seeing a more challenging environment than we did in May with OEMs remaining very cautious about the second half, particularly the back-to-school cycle.","It is against this backdrop that we provide the following outlook. For the third quarter of 2015, AMD expects revenue to increase 6% sequentially, plus 3% or minus 3%. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 29%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $340 million; interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $45 million. Inventory is expected to be approximately $850 million, in support of the second half product ramps and Semi-Custom sales to support the holiday season, and cash is expected to be approximately $700 million. This cash balance includes third quarter interest expense payments on our debt of approximately $70 million. Due to the recent change in the PC market outlook, our goal of second half profitability has been pushed out. However, we will continue to work towards improving our second half financial performance. We are assessing actions to be taken to reduce our current cost structure with a view to lower operating expenses to better align with our near-term revenue profile. We anticipate restructuring charges associated with those actions.","In conclusion, we look forward to seeing improvements in the back half of the year as we ramp Semi-Custom wins and our newest APU and GPU products. We remain focused on executing our longer-term product roadmap strategy as laid out at our Financial Analyst Day.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ruth. Ruth?","Ruth Cotter - Senior Manager-Investor Relations","Thank you, Devinder. Operator, if you could poll the audience for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Devinder, can you remind us as to what your minimum cash balance goal is? And also do you have \u2013 should you need to raise additional cash? Do you have an order of preference of the types of cash raised that you would work through?","Devinder Kumar - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, thank you, David. From a cash standpoint, as you probably heard us say previously, we have a minimum target of about $600 million to the range of $1 billion. We can manage it lower than that from a viewpoint of available revenue in our profile of the business model is right now. And in Q2, as you saw, we ended at about $830 million of cash. As far as the financing is concerned, our capital markets, on an ongoing basis, I monitor the capital markets pretty closely and if the need arises, obviously, we'll access the capital market. I think from an overall standpoint, if you think about it, with the cash that we have, we also have ABL availability that we put in place in the late part of 2013. And that's not all fully tapped out. So that's how I'd leave it from a cash standpoint, David.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, great. And, Lisa, can you give us some idea in terms of Semi-Custom activities, how many projects you have in the pipeline? You mentioned that you had one that you've begun working on. Are there others that we might hear about over the next few quarters?","Lisa T. Su - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, David. Thanks for the question. So on the Semi-Custom business, we've certainly been active in our work with various customers across target markets. So last year, we had announced two new Semi-Custom designs that were roughly $1 billion in lifetime revenue that would start ramp in the second half of 2016. We've started a new design this quarter that we believe expands our base for the Semi-Custom business, and we're very pleased with that. And then we still have a fairly active pipeline in Semi-Custom as well. So we view it as very much an area where there's a strategic interest in integrating our Graphics and CPU IP going forward.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thanks.","Lisa T. Su - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ian Ing with MKM Partners. Your line is open.","Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC","Hi, yes, my first question is in GPU refresh. I mean, it's only been days and weeks, but it looks like on the retail sides, the Fury X and Fury is out of stock. So being out of stock is just a demand issue or more of a supply constraint issue?","Lisa T. Su - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, Ian, thanks for the question. So we did just launch our Graphics products towards the end of the second quarter, so in the late June timeframe. I think our initial ramp-up has been as expected. We're pleased with the Fury X ramp-up, certainly the fact that it's out of stock is not a bad thing, because it gives us good confidence that the customers are appreciating the product. Fury just launched actually this week and we will be launching Nano in the August timeframe. So I think, overall, the high-bandwidth memory ramp-up is going as expected, and we have a number of products coming out.","Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC","Okay. And you talked about the channel business now behaving largely as expected. I mean, is that fairly stable at this point going forward? I know there's some China macro issues that are still coming up on earnings calls, like Fairchild this morning.","Lisa T. Su - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, so overall in our desktop and AIB channel business, we actually grew quarter-on-quarter, while reducing downstream inventory. So, we've been talking for the last couple of quarters of draining downstream inventory, and we now believe that we're close to largely completed with that. Yes, relative to China, I think there are some macro issues and we're watching carefully the China market overall, but relative to our channel business, I think the inventory corrections that we're working on have progressed as planned.","Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC","Great. And then my last question, I think you covered a lot of the second half catalysts and product cycles, but one thing I didn't hear about was the Seattle launch, the ARM-based Seattle launch, I think that's second half this year. Is that still on track or is there any other catalysts or product cycles we're missing?","Lisa T. Su - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, Ian, so for the key products for the second half, certainly Carrizo on the APU side, the Fiji family of products on the GPU side, and then Seattle will continue to launch in the second half of this year.","Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Lisa T. Su - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Ian.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking my question. On the Wafer Supply Agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES, I believe it was for $1 billion-plus or so this year. And so far you were done with $367 million. I'm just curious, Devinder, do you think you will be able to fulfill this obligation this year? And if not, are there any financial implications we should be taking into account?","Devinder Kumar - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, Vivek, I think on the Wafer Supply Agreement, we have taken about $400 million-plus for the year against the commitment we made earlier this year. But we are working actively to re-profile our wafer purchase commitment with GLOBALFOUNDRIES, in particular, given the business outlook.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So do you anticipate any financial implications that we should be taking into account when we look at your cash flow model?","Devinder Kumar - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think other than re-profiling the wafer purchase commitments, when you re-profile obviously there is a linkage to the cash from an outflow standpoint because the purchases happen and then the cash is paid out. But other than that, that would be \u2013 I don't anticipate any financial implications.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And maybe one for you, Lisa; if we look at the \u2013 you are actively trying to bring OpEx in line with the revenue profile. And if I look at all the Semi-Custom wins that you've had so far, they have been at lower gross margins. Is that how we should see some of the newer wins? Will they also be at lower gross margins than corporate average? And if it is a lower gross margins, do you think you can cut OpEx fast enough to be sustainably free cash flow positive sometime in the near future?","Lisa T. Su - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, so let me take that question in a couple of parts. So when we think about OpEx, look, we want to make very strategic decisions around OpEx. And we have a long-term roadmap. We have several segments that we're investing in for long-term growth and the Computing and the Graphics IP are critical to make that happen. That said, we do have to align our OpEx with our current revenue projections, and I think we have an opportunity to do that going forward.","Relative to Semi-Custom and what that means in terms of gross margin profile, I think the Semi-Custom business is across a set of target markets. So game consoles is one of those markets, but there are other markets that we have had success in, and when you look across those markets, I think there will be a range of gross margins as well, depending on the IP and the overall product specifications.","So, the goal is to return profitability. I think there's no question about that. And we will take active actions, on both the top line and the bottom line to do that, but I wouldn't make any assumptions about sort of the relationship between Semi-Custom and OpEx.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Canaccord Genuity Inc. Your line is open.","Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thank you very much for taking my questions. A little bit of a, I guess, longer-term strategic question for you, Lisa. Last night Intel announced the addition of a new chip on their 14-nanometer roadmap and pushed back 10-nanometer. It strikes two things; one, love to get your commentary relative to your foundry partners as to how the Moore's Law progression is going particularly with Zen coming on 14-nanometer next year, and second, it looks like now you will be in a position to potentially overlap your Zen products with a generation of Intel products that is still on 14-nanometer. Just your reaction to that in general and the competitive landscape on the foundry side. Thanks.","Lisa T. Su - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, Matt, so I do think the process technology landscape right now is quite interesting. So on your \u2013 the first part of your question, how do we view FinFET technologies? Actually, I think the maturity of FinFET technologies is coming along very nicely, and so we see it as an important part of our roadmap in 2016, across all of our markets. We have actually just taped out our first couple of FinFET designs. Relative to what that means for the competitive landscape going forward, I have been asked that question a couple of times over the last \u2013 last year, and my comments have been our focus is on design architecture, and it includes \u2013 and ensuring that we use all of our design architecture expertise.","So, Zen is a clean sheet design, and from an architectural standpoint I think it's going to be very competitive. The fact that the gap between foundry technologies and other technologies is shrinking, I think does change the competitive landscape and will be a good opportunity as we go forward competitively. So we are aggressively going after FinFET, and I think that's going to be an incredibly important node for us.","Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","That's helpful. And just as a follow-up for Devinder; you had mentioned in your commentary, rightsizing the operating costs for the new state of the business and you guys had given some targets for the full back half of the year at the Analyst Day, and you've pulled back on that profitability target now. Maybe you could just give a little more granular comments on what you think a proper OpEx structure is for the business as you see it right now relative to some of the larger-term targets you gave at the Analyst Day. Thank you.","Devinder Kumar - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, good question, and I think from a timeframe of profitability, we had said at the Financial Analyst Day that we expect to be profitable in the second half. Obviously that's been pushed out. We are taking actions to reduce the cost structure in line with the near-term revenue outlook, and if you look at the guidance we gave just for Q3, the OpEx is down from the $353 million down to $340 million and it will go down from there as we assess the actions and take actions to reduce the cost structure. Those actions are being assessed right now are not yet finalized, and once those are finalized obviously we will share the details with you.","Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","All right, thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I guess the first one, on the guidance, any sort of color you can give between the two segments, even directionally as you saw in the second quarter they performed significantly differently and that has big margin implications. So any color you can give there would be helpful.","Lisa T. Su - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, Ross, let me start and maybe Devinder will have some comments. So, in terms of the third quarter guidance, we do expect both segments to be up. We've said previously that the Semi-Custom business usually has its strongest quarter in the third quarter. We think that's going to continue to be the case. The Computing and Graphics business is coming off of a low quarter. So we would expect improvement in both units as well as overall revenue as well. So I think you'll see both segments improve in the third quarter.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. And I guess as the follow-up, looking a little further out on the Semi-Custom side of things, just wanted to follow up to earlier question on the gross margin side but take a little bit more of a revenue look at it first. If the new businesses are coming on throughout the 2016 period, but the traditional full penetration of the gaming business kind of folds over simultaneously, how do you view the tradeoff between those as it results in your ability to grow that segment of your business, and what does that mean to gross margin if some of those smaller aggregate dollar opportunities may have better gross margins than the game console Semi-Custom business that you have today?","Lisa T. Su - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, so let me try to put it this way. So the \u2013 let's call it the base Semi-Custom business that's around the game consoles, I think if you look at units and the units that ship year-on-year, I think we will still see 2016 to be a fairly solid year for the traditional, let's call it game console business overall. And then as we layer on top of it some of the new wins, I think that does give us potential to grow in the second half of the year. Obviously, there's a lot to happen between now and then. But I do see Semi-Custom as a growth driver for us going forward.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And the gross margin implication?","Lisa T. Su - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","With Semi-Custom, I think I would rather talk about operating margin because I think that's the better view of it, and I think the operating margins should also improve going forward.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Chaurasia with Nomura. Your line is open.","Sanjay Chaurasia - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Oh, hi, Lisa. I have a two-part question on HBM and a follow-up. First question on HBM is, is it margin accretive or dilutive within your GPU business? And second question is, as you integrated HBM, could you talk about the challenges you faced and would you say that you have any technological lead here in integrating HBM in GPUs? Is it basically the six month to eight month lead that you have been able to gain, or there's more to it than you could see, you could maintain a longer lead here?","Lisa T. Su - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, so maybe the second question first. Relative to HBM, I think we do have a lead. We're the first in the industry to integrate HBM in GPUs. We've targeted at the enthusiast segment because that's the right segment to, I would say, to learn the manufacturing technology. I would say that the manufacturing has come up as expected and we expect that the overall family of Fiji GPUs, the way we are rolling it out will be a strong set of products in the second half of the year.","Relative to the margins, I won't comment specifically about it. But I will say overall a key goal for us is to grow Graphics market share, and growing Graphics market share, having a leadership, strong product portfolio at the enthusiast segment helps across the entire portfolio.","Sanjay Chaurasia - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay, and as a follow-up, you talked about 20-nanometer designs migrating to FinFET. Could you talk about which specific product was impacted and any associated impact on your revenue growth in the second half?","Lisa T. Su - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, on the 20-nanometer case, we did speak a little bit about that at our Financial Analyst Day in May. We started several designs in 20-nanometer and after looking at the overall design tradeoffs, we felt that FinFET was much more competitive, and so we decided to move a number of designs into FinFET technology. Relative to the second half of the year, I don't think there's anything substantive to talk about. I think the important thing is ensuring that we get our product portfolio into FinFET technology next year, which will improve our overall competitiveness.","Sanjay Chaurasia - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Thanks for taking my questions. First one, on the new Semi-Custom design that you just started to work on, could you go through the life cycle of one of these; like, when do you see the NRE, when do you see the chip revenues from this come in?","Lisa T. Su - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, so we start initial NRE payments as we start the design, and that goes through the design life cycle, and then over \u2013 depending on the design it will take anywhere from 24 months to 36 months to see significant revenue. On this particular design, we haven't been specific on the overall timing, but I will say that the lifetime revenue is in the range that we had previously stated for Semi-Custom, so in the $200 million to $500 million range.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then, Lisa, Mark Papermaster has mentioned Virtual Reality as being one of the next big things in the industry. How does that market play out for you guys? When do you start participating in that?","Lisa T. Su - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, so we are extremely excited about the Virtual Reality market. I mean, if you look at the progression of that market and how quickly it has evolved, even over the last 12 months, I think it's an area that really uses both CPU and GPU technology. If you look at the headset manufacturers, or the ones that will have product out, most of those are stating product shipments sometime in the 2016 timeframe, starting early 2016.","So today, it's mostly developer systems, but working closely with the developers with our GPU technology, migrating to more commercial systems in 2016. There's a significant need for high-performance graphics and so we view it as a growth driver for our Graphics business.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","And on that, are you of the view that this is business applications or consumer gaming applications? Where do you think it will show up first?","Lisa T. Su - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, I think it will start with consumer gaming applications. That's where a lot of the activity is, but I think it will migrate to some education and other entertainment applications as well.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Okay, thank you. And last question for Devinder, if I may. Devinder, in the event that revenues continue to kind of trickle down, is there a \u2013 I understand that a lot of the R&D is shared. Is there an R&D level below which you really \u2013 the company does not want to go below?","Devinder Kumar - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think it goes back to some of the things we talk about at the Financial Analyst Day. Fundamentally, we have a roadmap. We have specific products that are coming out over the next, call it 18-month timeframe and we are going to do everything possible to protect that roadmap, and R&D is obviously going to be the higher priority from that standpoint. And even as we talk and contemplate about the actions we are going to take, we are going to do everything to protect that roadmap for the longer-term; strategic roadmap, as well as the financial model.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Fair enough. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland with FBR. Your line is open.","Christopher A.J. Rolland - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hey, guys, thanks for the question. So, first, just a quick clarification and then the question. I was a little confused on the Semi-Custom. Lisa, did you say that you had two new Semi-Custom wins and you just added one for a total of three or is it still just two?","Lisa T. Su - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, Chris, we had two that we announced last year, and then we just added a third.","Christopher A.J. Rolland - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. And the one that you just added, is that the new one or are you building one that will launch in 2016? That's the new one?","Lisa T. Su - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, that's the new one.","Christopher A.J. Rolland - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay, excellent. And secondly, on inventories, so, $850 million seemed a little bit high there. How much of that is that new Semi-Custom win that you're ramping there? And how much of it is console? And where might inventories space out in 2016?","Devinder Kumar - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, first of all to clarify the new Semi-Custom win that Lisa just referenced and you just discussed with her is out in time. It's not a second half 2015 inventory item. And then going back to your specific observation on the inventory being up from a Q2 to Q3 standpoint, it is a support the second half product ramp and Semi-Custom sales in particular, and really the second half being stronger than the first half from a revenue standpoint leads to that inventory going up from Q2 to Q3. And we continue to manage it and I fully expect that inventory comes down after we get past the Q3 timeframe.","Christopher A.J. Rolland - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. And, Devinder, while I have you, just on the back of some of the gross margin questions, there's so many moving parts. I think we're all having problems kind of modeling over the next year. So how can we think about it, just high level and directionally, with all of these moving parts, as game consoles roll off, as new Semi-Custom wins might roll on, and as we transition to 14-nanometer; just sort of directional insights here, just so that we don't get blindsided?","Devinder Kumar - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think if you look at it from a viewpoint of Q3, the drivers are obviously the mix of the products within the segments, but also Q3 in particular, the higher mix of the Semi-Custom as Lisa referenced is a peak quarter from a Semi-Custom revenue standpoint. After that, obviously the continuing trajectory that we have from the client PC group, as well as the Graphics piece getting into the Q4 timeframe. And so that's something that I look at from a second half standpoint. Out in 2016, you're right, there are a lot of factors that will come into play, Semi-Custom, as well as the PC products that we have. But I don't want to venture right now where that will be at this moment.","Christopher A.J. Rolland - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. Thanks so much, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, guys, thanks for taking my questions. First, I just want to dig into this a bit. You said Q3 obviously is a peak for Semi-Custom. You said Q2 was the trough for the company for the year, which it implies in Q4, Semi-Custom should be down, which means a pretty big ramp of the Computing Graphics business into Q4. I mean, high double digits, at least, if not more. I guess, what gives you confidence that that's going to happen and what are the consequences if that ramp doesn't come to play, given than you're building a ton of inventory that's supposed to sell out in Q4?","Devinder Kumar - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I'll start and then Lisa can add. I think if you look at what happened with the actions that we took going back several quarters, one thing we have done and we feel good about that is in the PC space and the channel inventory in particular, all of the actions that'll be started in the Q4 timeframe and Q1, Q2 largely completed. And as we said, the channel sales quarter-on-quarter were up and we feel good about that. Those are very directed actions taken in an aggressive manner by us. And in Q2, we did have the impact on the OEM APU sales in particular with our transition of Indostan (39:07).","And as we get to the second half, especially with the new products, we think we can ramp those products and the Q3 guidance as Lisa said earlier, takes into account an improvement both on the EESC segment, as well as the CG segment. Q4, we're not providing guidance, but as you get to the Q4 timeframe, we think the PC market continues to stabilize and that helps us from that standpoint. And that's the way we have it baked in.","On the inventory question that you have, as I explained earlier to another question, it is up from Q2 to Q3, but we are actively working with our partner, GLOBALFOUNDRIES, to go ahead and re-profile those commitments that we made earlier this year. And I think that should help from an inventory standpoint to go ahead and manage it, to where we think it's more comfortable and in line with the revenue outlook.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Right. I guess \u2013 I mean, you're telling me you feel good about Q4, but I mean, let's be honest, you haven't been able to forecast a month and a half out, let alone two quarters. It just seems to me like there's a setup here for more bad things to happen if that market doesn't stabilize. And even if it does stabilize, I mean, your business has been \u2013 let's be honest, it hasn't been stable, versus where the market's been either. I'm just wondering what the risk is, given the way you're setting up inventories and setting up expectations for that Q4 ramp.","Lisa T. Su - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, Stacy, so look, that's a fair comment. I'll take that. Now if I tell you what I see going forward, we'll give you the best information we have at this point in time. So the Semi-Custom business, Q3 will be the peak. We need a few more data points to really call Q4 correct. But so far, what we see is a solid market on the Semi-Custom side. On the Computing and Graphics side, there are \u2013 basically think about it as four pieces to the business. So we have OEM processors, we have channel processors, we have graphics, consumer graphics and then we have professional graphics.","So amongst those four segments from what we see, we are being a bit cautious on Q3, just given we need to see exactly how the OEMs ramp; the Windows 10 launch, we think Windows 10 is a good product, but we need to see how that launches. As we go into holiday, we believe we'll make progress in graphics. We believe we'll make progress in professional graphics. I've said that the channel looks like it's healthier for us and we need to see how the OEM demand looks. But those are the ways I think about Computing and Graphics. So clearly we're not happy with the performance in Q2 but as we look forward, we need to manage the business the way we see it and this is how we see it today.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. For my follow-up, I just wanted to see what other options you have besides OpEx cuts to arrest cash burn if that growth doesn't come back. We've already gone through, I guess, selling assets. You've stretched out your cash conversion cycle significantly this quarter. You've maxed out half of your revolver. What are your other options above and beyond that if the OpEx cuts themselves aren't enough, if the environment doesn't recover?","Devinder Kumar - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think there are always options. I think everything you just said in terms of managing the working capital and managing the cash, managing the inventory, making sure that's in line with the revenue profile from an outlook standpoint allows us to do that. And from a standpoint of cash, we've done a good job managing the cash over the last several quarters and several years. And I have confidence of doing that on a go-forward standpoint. And we'll monitor and see what is needed. And as I said earlier if the need arises, we will access the capital market. I still have the ABL availability as you just observed, and we'll do what's needed to continue to fund the business.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Capital markets means raise equity if you needed to, or debt?","Devinder Kumar - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I'm not going to get into the details on this call, Stacy, but I'm sure we can access capital markets if the need arises.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you very much, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Devinder, just a quick follow-up or clarification on my part on the cash comments; you guided to cash levels in the September quarter around $700 million. I think to an earlier question you said that you'd still feel comfortable operating below $600 million. I guess what I'm trying to figure out, is $700 million kind of what you envision to be the trough? Because with inventory coming down in Q4 and maybe the presumption of some sequential revenue growth, shouldn't cash grow from September to December? If you can just help me understand those dynamics, it'd be helpful.","Devinder Kumar - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, so the fact is, I think, if you look at it from a cash standpoint for the rest of the year, in Q3 with the cash guidance of $700 million, the way our debt maturity profile is, the cash interest payments happen in two quarters, in Q1 and Q3 to the tune of about $70 million. So there is a disproportionate impact of cash in Q1 and Q3 of our fiscal year, just the way the cash payments go out, even though the accounting is done on a pro rata even basis for the year.","And then you're right, we're managing the inventory and re-profiling some of the commitments that we have should help from a cash standpoint and we're very focused to go ahead and do that. Like I said, after we get through the Q3 timeframe, in Q4 we don't have the cash interest payments, and with the revenue being up in the second half, is what we are expecting starting with Q3, we think that it'll benefit the cash situation as we get to the end of the year.","John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That's helpful. And then, guys, maybe a little bit more clarification on the profile of inventory you are holding right now. I understand the need to grow inventory, Q2 to Q3 for new product launches, but the inventory growth in Q2, to what extent was that new product driven versus just demand on older products kind of not being there? And do we carry an obsolescence risk on any of the inventory going into the back half of the year?","Devinder Kumar - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Two parts to it, for the Q3 growth, new products as well as the Semi-Custom business has been higher in the second half compared to the first half. And that's specifically what is taking the inventory from about $800 million to the $850 million levels, that we are guiding to.","John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On the current Semi-Custom business or game console business, I know the team is focused on operating profitability but one way to drive that is through better gross margins. I think you obviously have a targeted cost curve that you are trying to drive. Hopefully that's faster than your negotiated ASP declines. If you can just give us an update on what the team is doing to drive the cost profile. And then I guess at some point, given the relatively long product life cycle for these products, any opportunities for die shrinks to drive a step function shift lower in cost per chip?","Lisa T. Su - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Harlan, so certainly we would like to drive both gross margins as well as operating margins. So the ASP declines are fairly well understood. Those are pre-negotiated. Relative to what we're doing to drive overall cost or COGS down, it's the usual things. It's yields, it's test times, it's procurement savings and those kind of things. I would say it's been largely as expected. These products are now several years into their life cycle.","To your follow-up question about die shrinks, I think if you look at the history of game consoles, you will normally see a die shrink, but that will happen out in time, and we'll discuss it at that point.","Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for that. And then on the server and data center side, there's been a lot of focus on the Intel-Altera deal and the potential to marry a CPU with a programmable parallel processing architecture to help with computational acceleration. Given that the GPU is a parallel processing engine, is it fair to assume that you guys already have the capabilities to offer either in a standalone form or in integrated form alongside your x86 or ARM-based server processors a similar type of solution and is that something that you have on your roadmap?","Lisa T. Su - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, so the idea of marrying a processor with some type of accelerator, whether it's a GPU or an FPGA I think is definitely important in the data center. We view that we do have the ability to do both integrated with our APUs, as well as in different packages, offering both CPU and GPU together. So I think the idea of using accelerators is definitely important in data centers. We agree with that. Different people will do it different ways, and certainly our approach will be to get very high-performance CPUs and GPUs that can interoperate.","Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Ruth Cotter - Senior Manager-Investor Relations","Operator, we'll take two more questions, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy with Stifel. Your line is open.","Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for taking my question. My question is related to Seattle. Have you announced design wins or can you give us an idea of what that product ramp looks like?","Lisa T. Su - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, so I think Seattle is a good offering for 64-bit ARM servers, and if you look at what we've said up until now, we have a number of companies both in the ecosystem, as well as users developing software on Seattle and looking at how it operates in the environment. I would say that the overall revenue of Seattle will be modest, as ARM ramps will take a bit of time, but the importance of building the ecosystem is there. So that's our focus with Seattle and working with key customers.","Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks. As just as a follow-up, what percentage of the market do you think that can address, Seattle?","Lisa T. Su - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think we've said before and my view on this is that the overall ARM server market or let's call it ARM in data center markets will take some time to develop. So let's call it the three-year to five-year timeframe. So in terms of today's market, we actually believe that the x86 will be the majority of the market.","Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Your line is open.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Yes, hi, guys. Just on your 14-nanometer FinFET transition. How do you see the ramp? I mean, when do you see the crossover on that as you go through 2016?","Lisa T. Su - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","When you say crossover, Vijay, you mean volume crossover or...","Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Yes, volume crossover or shipment crossover.","Lisa T. Su - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. We will be bringing different parts of the product line into FinFET at different points in time, so I don't think I have an exact answer for that. I think what we've said is graphics will certainly utilize FinFETs as well as our new Zen processors and so they will roll out over the quarters in 2016.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Got it. And on the Semi-Custom side, obviously, June quarter grew sequentially, but the operating margins declined significantly. What are you guys doing there to improve those operating margins there? I know you've been asked a couple of questions already, but, again, give some thoughts there.","Devinder Kumar - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, I can comment. If you are looking specifically at Q1 to Q2, the operating margin decline has the $33 million charge. There was a charge associated with the technology node transition from 20-nanometer FinFET, that's in the segment operating margin results.

My name is Eric [ph] and I will be your conference operator for today.","At this time I would like to welcome everyone to AMD's First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call.","[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Ruth Cotter, Vice President of Investor Relations for AMD. Please go ahead.","Ruth Cotter","Thank you, and welcome to AMD's first quarter earnings conference call. By now you should have had the opportunity to review a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary and slides. If you have not reviewed these documents, they can be found on AMD\u2019s website at ir.amd.com.","Participants on today's conference call are Rory Read, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Devinder Kumar, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. For the question-and-answer portion of the call, we will be joined by Lisa Su, our Senior Vice President and General Manager, Global Business Units.","This is a live call and will be replayed via webcast on amd.com.","I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to highlight a few dates for you. Lisa Su will attend the JPMorgan technology, media and telecom conference on Tuesday, May 20th in Boston. Devinder Kumar will attend the Bank of America-Merrill Lynch Global Technology Conference on June 3rd in San Francisco. Our second quarter quiet time will begin at the close of business on Friday, June 13th. And lastly, we intend to announce second quarter earnings on Thursday, July 17th.","Please note that non-GAAP financial measures referenced during this call are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in the press release and CFO commentary which are posted on our website at quarterlyearnings.amd.com.","Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today\u2019s discussions contain forward looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date, and as such involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.","Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information. You\u2019ll also find detailed discussions about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC and in particular AMD\u2019s annual report on form 10-K for the year ended December 28, 2013.","Now, with that, I will hand the call over to Rory. Rory?","Rory Read","Thank you, Ruth.","Revenue for the quarter was $1.4 billion, an increase of 28% from the year-ago period. The 12% sequential revenue decline from the previous quarter was better than our expectations due to healthy demand for our newest Radeon GPUs and semi-custom gaming APUs. This is our third consecutive quarter of delivering non-GAAP profitability. And we also saw an improvement in EPS of $0.15 from the year-ago period.","Our first quarter performance demonstrates the success that we are having transforming AMD's business. We are consistently executing and delivering on our commitments. Our strategy is working and we are building a foundation for continued profitability and growth as we transform AMD. We are on track to generate approximately 50% of our revenue from high-growth markets, including embedded, semi-custom, dense server, professional graphics and ultra-low-power client, where we can create differentiated winning solutions by the end of 2015.","There was strong demand in the first quarter for AMD-powered Microsoft and Sony game consoles. These consoles continued to outpace previous generation ramps and drove continued momentum in the semi-custom business. The success of these two products is an excellent example of the power of our strategy. When our unique IP and design expertise is married with the ingenuity and product ideas from our customers, we jointly delivered tailored market-changing solutions that win. We believe that our semi-custom business will continue to realize strong growth. As gaming consoles ramp throughout the year, we remain on track to capture one to two new semi-custom design wins this year as well.","Now turning to AMD's embedded business. Revenue increased by double digits from the year-ago period. We continued to win designs with strategic market makers in key verticals such as digital signage, medical and thin client, to name a few. Consistent with our strategy to participate in a much broader portion of this market, we see an approximately $9 billion total addressable market for our high-performance embedded SOCs and processors. This margin-accretive business is also characterized by product cycles that last up to five years, providing a more predictable and consistent revenue stream.","In our professional graphics business, we delivered sequential growth in the first quarter. We believe we gained share, highlighted by the launch of Apple Mac Pro which uses two of AMD's industry-leading FirePro GPUs. We are expanding our professional GPU products with the announcement of our new flagship FirePro W9100. This GPU is attracting significant interest from video, design and engineering professionals who need to work at the latest 4K resolutions and beyond.","We are also continuing to make investments to accelerate our growth by strengthening our relationships with key professional IFVs and customers that dominate market share.","In our dense server business, revenue also increased sequentially. This was highlighted by Verizon's ongoing deployment of AMD's SeaMicro-based dense servers that are powering the world's largest public cloud solution. The dense server market is projected to be approximately 25% of the overall server market by 2019. And we intend to lead this transition with our unique fabric technology and 64-bit processors.","We have also reached a significant milestone in our ambidextrous strategy. We have introduced Seattle, our first 64-bit ARM server processor and the industry's first at 28-nanometer technology, positioning AMD as the only SOC provider to bridge the x86 and ARM ecosystems for server applications. We are excited to announce that we have started sampling Seattle this last quarter and plan to ship in the fourth quarter of 2014.","Now let's turn to our traditional businesses. In graphics we see strong demand in the enthusiast portion of the market. Our industry-leading R7 and R9 products drove GPU revenue growth year over year and sequentially. And we also started to see the ramp of new mobile discrete design wins. And we believe this momentum will continue and we expect to gain market share.","In our personal computing business, our mobile APU unit shipments increased sequentially in the first quarter as our customers prepared to introduce notebooks powered by our newest Beema and Kaveri APUs.","In the desktop channel, we continue to build momentum in the upper part of our portfolio as we enrich our product mix. Our high-end A8 and A10 APUs had a second straight quarter of record unit shipments. We continue to build a stronger desktop portfolio, ramping our high-end Kaveri APU and introducing our first low-powered socketed APU for the desktop channel this past quarter. We expect these APUs will drive revenue growth in the coming quarters.","The PC market continues to remain challenging. We are seeing signs that the market decline is slowing and potentially stabilizing as some of the softness in consumer is being offset by demand for commercial PCs. Based on this, we now expect overall PC shipments will decline approximately 7% to 10% for the year, and we are positioned to take advantage of this based on our strategy to gain share in parts of the market where we are currently under-represented.","For example, in the commercial client market, we expect to more than double the number of designs that will come to market from our key OEM partners compared to last year. As a result, we believe we will deliver sequential PC revenue growth in the coming quarters of 2014.","Since our last earnings call, we also successfully concluded our 2014 WSA amendment with Global Foundries and re-profiled our near-term debt, both of which will help us accomplish our financial goals for 2014 and beyond. The vendor will cover both of these topics in detail later in the call.","So in summary, we continue to hit all of our key milestones and product commitments as part of our long-term strategy to transform AMD. Our first quarter performance demonstrates that we are making significant progress building the strong foundation required to deliver consistent profitability and revenue growth. Our growth businesses continue to gain momentum. And we remain on track to diversify our revenue base, generating approximately 50% of our revenue from our high-growth businesses by the end of the next year.","We also see the PC market beginning to stabilize. And we are well-positioned to grow revenue throughout the year. Finally, based on the strength of our industry-leading graphics products, we believe we will gain share and grow GPU revenue in 2014.","Based on this momentum, we remain firmly committed to delivering profitability and revenue growth for the full year in 2014.","With that, let me turn the call over to Devinder.","Devinder Kumar","Thank you, Rory.","Our first quarter results demonstrated continued financial and operational discipline and execution. Our gross margin and revenue came in at or better than expected, despite a seasonally down demand environment, and we achieved non-GAAP net income profitability and earnings per share for the third quarter in a row.","Building on the momentum we established in the second half of 2013, 2014 is off to a good start. Additionally, we successfully completed a couple of significant transactions by re-profiling our debt and concluding the fourth amendment to our wafer supply agreement, WSA, with Global Foundries. Under the revised WSA agreement, we expect wafer purchases from Global Foundries to be approximately $1.2 billion in 2014 on a take-or-pay basis.","Our 2014 wafer purchases are in line with our current PC market expectations and also include the manufacturing of certain GPU and semi-custom game console products at Global Foundries. There are no special payment triggers as part of the fourth amendment of the wafer supply agreement for 2014. In Q1 2014, we spent approximately $250 million on wafer purchases from Global Foundries.","Let me now provide some specifics on the quarter. Revenue in the first quarter of 2014 was $1.4 billion, a decrease of 12% from the previous quarter and an increase of 28% year over year. Typically the first quarter of the year is a seasonally down quarter, and the sequential decline was driven by decreased sales of both our traditional and semi-custom products. Gross margin was 35%, flat sequentially. The first quarter result includes a $4 million benefit from the sale of previously reserved inventory in the third quarter of 2012 as compared to a $7 million benefit in the fourth quarter of 2013.","Non-GAAP operating expenses were $421 million and down from $462 million in Q4 2013. GAAP operating expenses of $438 million, and include a $14 million charge for workforce rebalancing severance expenses as part of the ongoing transformation and diversification strategy at AMD as we continue to increasingly focus and deploy appropriate resources to our high-growth opportunities.","Consistent with our strategy to transform AMD and manage for sustainable profitability, non-GAAP operating income was $66 million and non-GAAP net income was $12 million, while non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.02, calculated using 761 million diluted shares. Adjusted EBITDA was $139 million, a decrease of $26 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to reduced operating income.","Now turning to the business segments. Computing Solutions segment revenue was $663 million, down 8% sequentially, in line with seasonal trends. The decrease was primarily due to lower desktop and chipset unit shipments, partially offset by higher notebook unit shipments. Computing Solutions' operating loss was $3 million, an improvement from an operating loss of $7 million in the fourth quarter, despite the sequential $8 million or $59 million decline in revenue. This was driven primarily by lower operating expenses.","Graphics and Visual Solutions segment revenue was $734 million, down $131 million or 15% from the prior quarter, primarily due to a decrease in sales of our semi-custom SOCs. Operating income was $91 million, compared to an operating income of $121 million in the prior quarter.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance, including long-term marketable securities, totaled $982 million at the end of the quarter, close to our optimal balance of $1 billion and well above our target minimum of $600 million. During Q1 2014 we also made the final $200 million cash payment to Global Foundries related to the reduction of the take-or-pay wafer obligation commitments for 2012.","Inventory was $869 million, down $15 million or 2% sequentially as we reduced graphics inventory.","Debt as of the end of the quarter was $2.14 billion, up slightly from the prior quarter. During the first quarter we repurchased $62 million of our 6% convertible notes due in May 2015 in the open market utilizing cash on hand. We also issued $600 million in principal value of 6-3\/4% notes due in March 2019 utilizing the proceeds to extinguish most of our 6% convertible notes due in May 2015 and approximately $50 million of our 8-1\/8% notes due in December 2017. The remaining net proceeds of approximately $80 million borrowed under the new debt issuance will be used to pay down or repurchase outstanding debt in due course.","By executing these transactions, we have pushed out the maturity of a significant portion of our near-term debt and now have no significant debt maturity spending until December 2017, a period of more than three and a half years.","Accounts payable at the end of the quarter was $483 million, down slightly from $519 million in the fourth quarter.","Lastly, we had negative free cash flow of $225 million in Q1 2014, largely due to the previously mentioned $200 million payment of Global Foundries.","Now turning to the outlook, for the second quarter of 2014, AMD expects revenue to increase 3% sequentially plus or minus 3%. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 35%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $435 million. Inventory is expected to increase slightly from the first quarter and cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including long-term marketable securities, is expected to be approximately $1 billion.","In closing, we are pleased with our first quarter results in a seasonally down quarter. We have started 2014 with continued financial and operational discipline and maintain non-GAAP net income profitability for the third quarter in a row. We are making continued progress in our strategic transformation journey with the goal of transitioning approximately 50% of our revenues to high-growth adjacent markets and businesses by the end of 2015. Our focus in 2014 remains on managing for profitability as we work to deliver full-year revenue growth and net income profitability.","With that, I'll turn it back to Ruth. Ruth?","Ruth Cotter","Thank you, Devinder.","Operator, we'd be now happy for you to poll the audience for questions please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions]","And our first question comes from Betsy Van Hees from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Betsy Van Hees \u2013 Wedbush Securities","Good afternoon. Congratulations on the quarter and the guidance. Rory, I was wondering if we could dig a little deeper into your commentary. You said that you now see the PC market declining 7% to 10%, versus your prior guidance of 10% -- down 10% sequentially, sorry. And I was wondering if you could tell us, give us a little more detail as to what happened during the quarter to give you that confidence level that the PC market will decline at a lesser rate than your previous expectations.","Rory Read","Thanks, Betsy. Yeah, absolutely. What we've seen is the commercial market's been a bit stronger. Whether that's driven by the XP refresh work that's gone on through April, or it's continuing refresh across commercial, I do believe commercial is going to be a bit stronger this year than we anticipated based on that XP refresh and the strength of the overall economic environment. And that's offsetting a bit of the pressure that we're continuing to see in consumer from tablet.","I think the PC market will be down, no question, and I believe that it's down 7% to 10%. And it's really driven on that strength of the commercial space.","As it relates to us though, Betsy, what I like about what we're doing is the diversification strategy is really taking hold. What we're trying to do is to win in the desktop space as well as capture [indiscernible] commercial segment for AMD. And that's why I talked about in the early part of the call that we see the opportunity for us, AMD, to grow our PC revenue in the coming quarters of 2014.","Betsy Van Hees \u2013 Wedbush Securities","Thanks, Rory. And since you mentioned the desktop business as well as the notebook, your ASPs were flat sequentially, and I would assume that your desktop ASPs are higher than your notebook, but yet your ASPs were flat, which is really great. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about what drove that flat ASPs in the market and what you're seeing.","Lisa Su","Yeah, Betsy. This is Lisa. Maybe let me give you a little color on that.","So, yeah, relative to what we saw, was, you know, very much in line with our strategy that we've been weighing out on improving the mix of our product. So in the desktop channel, in the first quarter, we launched Kaveri at the high end of the stack. So from that standpoint, it did very well, and that was a good driver for us in terms of the mix improvement. And in the notebook business we also saw that we're starting to launch some of our new products that will go into market later in the second quarter. So we started shipping Beema in the notebook segment. And both of those helped to, you know, keep the ASPs at that flattish range.","Betsy Van Hees \u2013 Wedbush Securities","Thanks, Lisa, that was very helpful. And then my last question and I'll jump out of the queue and let others ask questions, is about, how should we look at the guidance of basically flat to up 6%? As you look at your different business units, will competing will be growing more or semi-custom be growing more? I wonder if you could help rank us on how we should be looking at and modeling that?","Rory Read","Yes. So from a standpoint of what we talked about in the early part of the call, there's no doubt that we continue to see momentum across the growth businesses. You know, Betsy, this has been a record ramp in terms of the game consoles. You probably saw some of the news coming out of Sony earlier this week. Microsoft had a very good launch with the Titanfall game. These are perfect examples of how when we combine our IP and design expertise with their great ideas, we can really breathe life and create a real change in the marketplace. We see that in embedded, we see that in semi-custom, we see that in pro graphics. These are all areas -- dense server -- where we see an opportunity for us to continue to build on that momentum.","At the same time, our part of the PC business, we're doing a nice job of introducing a nice set of new products that are positioning us to grow as we come to the next quarters of 2014.","Betsy Van Hees \u2013 Wedbush Securities","Thanks, Rory. And once again, congratulations on a great quarter and guidance.","Rory Read","Thanks, Betsy.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking my question. I actually had one short-term and then longer-term question. So on the shorter-term, I'm curious, what's your sense of the inventory of game console or chips in the channel? I mean you certainly had a very strong ramp. But if my math is right, by Q2 you would have probably shipped over 20 million console chips, which is I imagine, you know, 4 million, 5 million above the potential sales of those consoles. Is it that we should be expecting, you know, seeing those second half just because of the lag between the new ship and when the consoles ship? Or just if you could give us a sense of what the inventory situation is of all these console chips.","Lisa Su","Sure, Vivek. This is Lisa. Let me give you some guidance there.","So in terms of how the game consoles have behaved, I mean they've actually done quite well. There were some seasonality in the first quarter coming off of a very strong holiday season, but we've been pleased with the results.","And relative to inventory, we don't see any significant inventory build-up in the channel. So our expectation for semi-custom is that the second half in terms of units will be higher than the first half as we're going into the second holiday season. And everything that we see is that the consoles are selling through nicely.","Rory Read","And Vivek, one of the things that we're taking a deep focus is we're consciously managing how we're introducing product into the market. Remember, as we talked about in 4Q, how we manage the notebook transition, you saw that, in terms of a return to seasonality in 1Q. We're doing the same thing, working with our strategic partners across gaming to build the product, to introduce the product, to create a velocity model where the product's going into the channel, moving through cleanly, and executing off of that site. That's the kind of business and execution we want to drive consistently so we have nice, smooth revenue through this.","Vivek Arya \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And then maybe, Rory, you guys have been able to achieve your target for the semi-custom as part of your revenues last year and you have laid out a longer-term target. I'm curious, what do you think is going to be the proportion of semi-custom by the end of 2014? And as part of that, I think you have mentioned about one or two opportunities -- if you could give us some more color what end-markets do they represent, when should we start baking those, and what milestones should we look for in those opportunities?","Rory Read","Sure. From a semi-custom perspective, we see a very robust and interesting pipeline across many segments, and I'm sure Lisa will add some color in just a second. We are on track to tackle the one to two design wins this year. I think they're very interesting. And as we look through the year, as Lisa just said, Vivek, I think that we see momentum in this ramp, we see momentum in this launch, and we expect this business to continue to move through the year well.","So, Lisa, did you want to add some color on where you see these design wins and where the robustness of this pipeline is?","Vivek Arya \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sure. So, you know, Vivek, when we talk about the opportunity pipeline for semi-custom, they are very, you know, sort of tailored opportunities, but they are across multiple segments. So our strength is currently in gaming, given our strength in graphics. But we're seeing opportunities across mobile enterprise as well as some of the other consumer sectors.","I think our engagement model with these guys is very, very deep architectural discussions and really solutions work. And that's what we're in the progress of doing right now. And so we have good visibility into achieving the key milestones of one to two design wins this year.","Rory Read","And that's a really important guidepost for you to look for, Vivek, as we demonstrate this as a key part of our business, a key part of our strategy, and showing those design wins and delivering on the commitments we're making here on this call this year is a very important part that you should look at, and we're on track for those items.","Vivek Arya \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And then last very quick one on the long term. You guys have clearly now stabilized the business. So as we think about your longer-term targets, which is to get 50% of revenues from semi-custom, what does that imply for the business model in terms of gross and operating margins? Because your gross margins have come down to the mid-30s level. How should we think about those gross and operating margin numbers to construct a longer-term model for AMD. Thank you.","Rory Read","Sure. So what we've talked about in terms of the strategic view is we want to enter into these growth segments. We used to be a business centered over one stream of revenue, one opportunity, the PC market. Now we've introduced five new ones with our traditional space that seeks key markets where we can leverage our core IP. We see this as an opportunity to consistently grow and to consistently expand profitability. We'll look through 2014, '15, '16, '17 as an opportunity for us to lift this revenue consistently and deliver profitability. I don't think we're ready yet to say what that growth rate is because we're in the transformation phase, and clearly we want to continue to demonstrate to everyone on this call that when we make a commitment, we deliver on that commitment.","Devinder Kumar","Yeah. Vivek, one clarification. You mentioned 50% on the semi-custom space, the 50% target, at the end of 2015, in addition to semi-custom, which obviously is a big piece, also includes dense server, professional graphics, embedded, all of those three higher than the corporate average from a gross margin standpoint. Semi-custom, you called it right, the gross margin is lower than corporate margin, but it's operating margin accretive. And then we have ultra-low-power business that's part of the mix that Rory mentioned in terms of the six total businesses that we are focused on, to get to the 50% by the end of 2015.","Vivek Arya \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Rolland of FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Christopher Rolland \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Hey guys. Congrats on the quarter and thank you for letting me ask question as well. Can you guys talk about the puts and takes of either moving or perhaps not moving your next-generation follow-on to Kaveri to the next node here and how this might affect your decisions to move other products and families to the next node, or not to move them? Thanks.","Lisa Su","Sure, Chris. So let me take that and give you a little bit of our thinking.","So in terms of product and technology selection, certainly we need to be at the leading-edge of the technology roadmap. So what we've said in the past is certainly this year all of our products are in 28-nanometer across both, you know, graphics client and our semi-custom business. We are, you know, actively in the design phase for 20-nanometer and that will come to production. And then clearly we'll go to FinFET. So that would be the progression of it.","Relative to the competitiveness of the products, we feel very good about the competitiveness of the products, to vary in terms of total compute, what we're able to do across the stack with our Beema product line and our graphics capability.","Rory Read","And what you're also going to see, Chris, is how we're going to continue to leverage our software stack and our software capability to truly differentiate, not only in terms of performance but tailor it to the specific solutions that we see out there, and engage us. As a good example of that, the work that we're doing there is being proved out and the examples like PC market point one, these are industry metrics that are showing how AMD's products performed, and software plays a very key role in that. And we're going to continue to invest in that.","Christopher Rolland \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Okay, great. Also there have been pretty widespread stories out there about high-end gaming cards either not on the shelves or going two times MSRP. And I know a lot of those are going into coin mining [ph] out there. So what do you guys in terms of this market right now? Is it still alive? Have you guys met the supply now out there or do you think this quarter maybe that it will be met? And then where do you think that sort of goes over time?","Lisa Su","Sure. So, Chris, the graphics market was certainly good for us in the first quarter. We were pleased with the performance. What we did see is we did see strong demand, particularly in the enthusiast and performance segments, with our R9 and R7. We did have let's call it the supply not quite meeting demand for the first quarter, and that was largely due to just like I said high demand. We expect that to catch up in the second quarter.","Relative to the big coin or the white coin stuff, the way we look at it is, we're designing these products to be leadership, you know, graphics, gaming capability. We have a lot of investment in the ecosystem and all of the other things like in our project mantle that really gets the software ISVs optimizing to AMD. So we think that's driving long-term demand. And relative to the current currency stuff, we'll see how it develops over the next couple of quarters.","Christopher Rolland \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Okay, great. I'll just squeeze in one more quick one if that's all right. So, love the profitability in GPU. But there was an operating loss in all other, maybe wider than expected. Maybe if you can go on the little puts and takes, what that's all about, and what we might expect there for the rest of the year. Thanks.","Devinder Kumar","I think just to clarify, when you say wider than expected loss, what do you mean by that, Chris?","Christopher Rolland \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Wider than I had expected, let's put it that way.","Devinder Kumar","Yeah, okay. Well, if you look at the Computing Solutions segment, if that's what you're referring to, revenue was down because of seasonality from Q4 to Q1. And the loss I guess was $7 million going to $3 million. We do have the impact in all other of the stock comp expense. That's pretty -- it was the same as last quarter. And then there was a severance that I talked about in my prepared remarks of about $14 million that exist in the all other as opposed to the two business segments.","Rory Read","I think, Chris, what's really important to look in terms of the compute segment is the fact that we returned to a more seasonal performance in terms of our business, and that we're talking about the opportunity for us to see growth in the future quarters of 2014. That's different than where we've been over the past two years, and that reflects the kind of products that we're creating and the kinds of strategic relationships we're building with our customers.","Let's go to the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Hans Mosesmann from Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Hans Mosesmann \u2013 Raymond James","Thank you guys. Question, this is probably for Lisa, in terms of making a big push in tablets, subsidizing a fair amount of the design expense in Asia with the ODMs and so forth, what impact, if any, does that have with low-ends and Beema? Because there's probably some -- a gray area there where you actually could compete with some of these types of platforms. And I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Lisa Su","Sure. So, Hans, when we look at sort of what we're doing with our product portfolio, it's really about building a balanced portfolio. Clearly low-end tablets are very competitive and we are not going after the very low end of the space. And we're looking at a balanced portfolio around both profitability and share.","And so for Mullins and Beema, I mean I think we have a strong sort of design wins for those products. We expect those to launch in Q2 and build through the second half of the year. And what we're looking to do with those products is really get a clear portfolio mix. So we'll be very aggressive at the low end where we need to be for the entry-level notebooks. But we want to balance that with enough profitability off the stack, and we think that the performance of these products, particularly Beema, that's very well reaching up further than we had before with our previous generation Kabini.","Hans Mosesmann \u2013 Raymond James","Okay, thanks. And then as a follow-up, so you started sampling Seattle, you're going to be shipping in Q4. What is the visibility, if any, in general, in terms of the adoption that you see into next year by hyper-scale guys and so on for ARM in general -- yeah.","Lisa Su","Sure. So, you know, what I'll tell you is that there's been a lot of customer interest around Seattle, so certainly for the server guys, the hyper-scale guys and then even some adjacent markets, there's good customer interest. I think the important thing for us and what we're working with the customers on is platform development and software development and ensuring that we get some of the ecosystem there.","So relative to revenue, it's probably a little early to tell what's going to happen in 2015, but I'll say the interest in the platform is quite high and it's a major milestone for us to introduce our first 64-bit ARM chip into the market.","Rory Read","And Hans, getting that ambidextrous strategy in place and launch it, that's a really important milestone. What we're doing here is identifying this opportunity long before it's taken place. And we're catching it just as the way it is forming. That's the kind of innovation leadership that we really want to go after.","This is going to be an important market over the next three, five years, and we have an opportunity to truly lead in this ARM server ecosystem, and take advantage of our ambidextrous capability. This is spot-on in the strategy.","Hans Mosesmann \u2013 Raymond James","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Wong of Wells Fargo.","David Wong \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thanks very much. Does your guidance for the June quarter assume Computing Solutions sales go up or go down sequentially?","Devinder Kumar","We assume that they go up from Q1 to Q2.","David Wong \u2013 Wells Fargo","Great. And when will we expect you to introduce GPU products at a node below 28 nanometers? Will have you have any 20-nanometer GPUs this year or next year?","Lisa Su","David, I think what I said earlier sort of what we're doing in terms of technology strategy, we are 28 this year, we have 20-nanometer in design, and then FinFET thereafter. So that's the overall product portfolio.","David Wong \u2013 Wells Fargo","That includes GPUs, Lisa?","Lisa Su","That's the overall product portfolio, so I'm not being specific about graphics versus other products.","David Wong \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay, great. And my final question, when do you expect to first start generating semi-custom revenues from chips made at Global Foundries? And will moving to Global Foundries for game console chips reduce the cost of the chips or is it a neutral move?","Lisa Su","Yes. So we will see semi-custom chips from Global Foundries in the second half of this year. And relative to our operating margin guidance on semi-custom, it stays the same. So it's what we've said previously.","David Wong \u2013 Wells Fargo","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cody Acree of Ascendiant Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Cody Acree \u2013 Ascendiant Capital Markets","Thanks for taking my questions, and congrats. Lisa, you talked a bit about the enterprise strength. Can you talk about where your split is now in your branch, the consumer, and what you expect that to look like for the rest of the year?","Lisa Su","Right. So relative to the client business, was that the question, or relative to data center?","Cody Acree \u2013 Ascendiant Capital Markets","No. Clients.","Lisa Su","Okay. Yes, we also do client business. I would say we're pretty under-represented in commercial or enterprise at this point in time. So we have a good set of design wins, and those are going to ramp in the second half of the year. We've worked very closely with some of the major OEMs. And so we expect the commercial client side of the business to be a growth engine for us. As Rory said, we expect to grow the PC business overall, and commercial will be an important piece of that.","Cody Acree \u2013 Ascendiant Capital Markets","And you talked about the low end of the tablet market, something you're going after, we've heard Intel talking pretty aggressively about going after the sub-$400 notebook market. What impact are you seeing there in an area that has typically been your strong suit?","Lisa Su","Certainly the consumer portion -- the low-end consumer portion of the PC business is the most volatile piece of it, so there is a lot of competition there and the prices are aggressive. However, back to our overall strategy, I think the key piece for us was building a strong foundation for the client business. It's an important piece of our business and we want to manage it for both growth and profitability.","And so our focus is really on, how do we get, you know, the right mix into the marketplace, making sure that we're selling our value proposition, you know, the strength of our products? And so if we miss on some units at the low end, so be it. But we want to make sure that we have a balanced business across the stack going forward.","Cody Acree \u2013 Ascendiant Capital Markets","And then lastly, on the dense server side, so Seattle in the third quarter. What's the intersection of SeaMicro working on your Seattle platform, timing that, versus what has historically been more Intel levered?","Lisa Su","Yes. So one of the advantages of having a systems business is that we can do co-development between our chip development and our systems development. So it will be quite important for us to have Seattle and SeaMicrosystems, and that's in development.","Cody Acree \u2013 Ascendiant Capital Markets","And will those launch in Q4 together?","Lisa Su","The Q4 statement was a chip statement.","Cody Acree \u2013 Ascendiant Capital Markets","Okay. And then lastly, the interest, the heavy interest you said you're seeing in Seattle. How big of that -- how much of that is driven by the strength that you have in your fabric?","Lisa Su","I think what we're seeing in Seattle is really interest from a number of different angles. I think the, you know, there's general interest in ARM, there is interest in sort of trying out the new workloads with the capability. I think we see the fabric as an important differentiator, but we see that as a longer-term differentiator in the systems portion of the business. So I think the interest in Seattle is really, you know, it's the first 28-nanometer, 64-bit server chip out in the market. And I think that's driving the customer engagement.","Cody Acree \u2013 Ascendiant Capital Markets","Thank you very much, and congrats.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Joe Moore \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great. Thank you. The timing [indiscernible] GPUs into Global Foundries, is that also second half? And I guess just do you think there's any risk of getting those products qualified on time to sort of use up the entirety of the $1.2 billion [indiscernible]?","Lisa Su","Yeah, actually for the timing of the graphics in Global Foundries, we've already started shipping from Global Foundries in graphics. So we think that the qualification cycle has been as expect, so.","Rory Read","And from a standpoint, Joe, just like we did in 2013, we laid out our commitments and delivered on those commitments. As we move into '14, that WSA, each of the commitments we are doing and making here, we're focused on the execution to deliver those. We're on track to meet that objective of WSA, and you should see it as that commitment.","Joe Moore \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, great. Thank you. And then for semi-custom products outside of consoles, are you -- do you meet [ph] with the GPU in those sales or are these kind of more GPU driven, or is it the combination of the two? I mean, can you just give us some idea of kind of what the value proposition that you're selling outside of the game console market in semi-custom?","Lisa Su","Sure. So really the value proposition for semi-custom outside of game consoles is sort of the integrated package between our CPU capability, having both ARM and x86 capability, as well as our leading-edge graphics, and the ability to integrate sort of very custom solution for these architectures. So I think it's all of the above. The foundation is the IP, and then the blue is sort of the SOC integration and architectural capability.","Rory Read","Joe, one of the things, as you may know, I came from the customer side. The customer side that we're working with day in and day out to create that strategic relationship, they're looking for an edge. Just like we did with Microsoft and Sony, we created an edge for them. We created a differentiated solution by narrowing our IP with their ingenuity and product ideas. That's exactly what we want to do in semi-custom. We're becoming easy to work with, we are delivering on our execution and commitments with that [indiscernible] and people are out in the marketplace looking for that edge on the semiconductor side how they can beat the market. And they don't want just commercial standard solutions anymore. They want a unique offering that allows them to change the game and win. And that's exactly what we're trying to do in semi-custom.","Joe Moore \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Andrew Paik \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi. This is Andrew Paik calling on behalf of John Pitzer.","Just to quickly touch on embedded on semi-custom business again. It'd be very helpful if you could elaborate on some of the specific application products that you're targeting. I guess those, you're not necessarily engaged in right now, but targeting within the growth end-markets you discussed earlier. Thank you.","Lisa Su","Sure. So -- Andrew -- so on the semi-custom side, as we said, there's a wide range of opportunities. These are usually larger opportunities that drive higher volume and can justify a semi-custom NRE engineering expense. So, things like gaming, of course, mobility, enterprise applications, and sort of other consumer, things like living room type applications, would be kind of semi-custom, sort of high-volume stuff.","Relative to embedded, we really see embedded as a very interesting long-term growth opportunity because it fits very well with our APUs and GPUs, and we're able to differentiate and call, you know, visual embedded type solutions. So, things like digital signage, industrial controls and automation, medical imaging. Those are some examples. Fin client [ph] are other examples that fit well with our embedded business. So those are the end-markets that we're attacking.","Andrew Paik \u2013 Credit Suisse","Got it. Thank you. Very helpful.","And I just want to quickly touch on the gross margin, longer-term gross margin structure again. I know someone asked this earlier, but is it largely a function of product mix or is there other I guess important element that could be a positive driver in the near-term future. Thank you.","Devinder Kumar","I think if you look at the gross volume drivers, the embedded business that Lisa and Rory talked about. We talked about the professional graphics, the growth we had in 2013 and continued the momentum into 2014, you have the dense server piece of it, and then a richer PC mix on the commercial space. All of those in combination are higher than corporate average gross margin. So that's obviously good.","The PC market environment obviously is a factor, and we see that at least from where we were with the 10% down to the 7%, 10% not improving. If effect [ph] richer mix there, that could benefit the gross margin.","And part of the mix here is because the semi-custom business is likely different -- is a different model. You have lower than corporate average gross margin, but is accretive to the operating margin line. And that is where the mix and the interplay happens for the gross margin for the short term and also for the longer term as we continue to diversify our product portfolio.","Andrew Paik \u2013 Credit Suisse","Got it. Thank you. And as my last question, relative to your updated view on the overall PC end-market to be down approximately 7% to 10% year over year, I guess do you expect your Computing Solutions business to outperform your expectation of the overall PC end-market or mostly in line to the -- to your updated view of the PC market? Thank you.","Rory Read","From our perspective, I think there's an opportunity for us, as we said, to return to seasonality in first quarter. We did that. Now we've set the objective to grow in the future quarters of 2014. I think that's the next step and the logical next step in terms of our stabilization of that business.","Let's take a look at how this next quarter unfolds. We have a whole set of new commercial products that are beginning to roll out. We have the desktop channel. You may have noticed that we introduced that low-power socketed APU into the channel this quarter. We're seeing some nice trends there and some nice product introductions, but we also have a competitor that's really taking a different approach in terms of revenue management and they have a different philosophy on profitability sometimes, and we're going to choose the mix and the right business.","This idea of counter-revenue [ph] is a foreign idea to us.","Andrew Paik \u2013 Credit Suisse","Got it. Thank you -- very helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from JoAnne Feeney of ABR Investment Strategy.","JoAnne Feeney \u2013 ABR Investment Strategy ","Hi. Congrats, folks, on a nice quarter. I have a question about the Global Foundries new agreement. Given what you ended up spending last year, sub $1 billion, this year up to $1.2 billion. Can you perhaps give us a sense of a breakdown of that number, that growth in the anticipated payments? How much of it is coming from higher anticipated production of chips they already product, the APUs, and how much of it is coming from the graphics that you're moving over and then how much from the semi-custom you anticipate in the second half? If you could give us any color on that, it would be really helpful.","Devinder Kumar","Yes, JoAnne, I can give you some color. I may not get that specific or granular in terms of the various parts that you mentioned, but if you recall, 2013 we had an original agreement at about $1.2 billion. As we broadened in 2013 with the relationship and the partnership, we took $200 million less wafers in 2013 without any special payments or penalties.","If we go on to 2014, we look at the demand profile, we have taken about $250 million in Q1 of 2014 and the overall purchases on a take-or-pay basis for 2014 are $1.2 billion. What I can tell you is everything we've talked about in the PC business, the purchases of the PC products from Global Foundries is in line with our business expectations, no impact from a financial standpoint and from a gross margin standpoint. And the balance of that obviously is in the semi-custom high-end graphics space, the products that we are taking from Global Foundries in 2014.","JoAnne Feeney \u2013 ABR Investment Strategy ","Okay, that's helpful. And then as a quick follow-up, in your efforts to better representation in the commercial business, is it primarily in the desktop that you feel like you're making inroads or the notebook, or a balanced mix of both?","Lisa Su","Yeah, JoAnne, we actually see opportunity across desktop and notebook for commercial, and it's really a good set of design wins and platforms that we think will be offered in the market in the second half of the year.","JoAnne Feeney \u2013 ABR Investment Strategy ","Okay, great. And then one other clarification. On the new semi-custom business you're working on this year, it sounds like you are approachable enough that you have these design wins in place, you anticipate getting these design wins, but perhaps it's too early to talk about the revenue stream. Can you give us any sense of where you are in the design win process and perhaps any sense of how the revenues might compare to what you have so far on the game console side?","Rory Read","We're, as I said earlier, JoAnne, we're on track to close one to two of those wins this year. And I think that's clear as where we are and what we're trying to do. Let us get those things closed. And there are going to be confidential wins, but we'll make it clearer as the year unfolds. That's about where we should be. But we're on track on those one to two wins as we said we would be for 2014.","JoAnne Feeney \u2013 ABR Investment Strategy ","Okay, thanks. That's helpful.","Ruth Cotter","Operator, we'll take two more questions please.","Operator","Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies & Co. Please go ahead.","Mark Lipacis \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Thanks for taking my questions. First question, hoping you can help me with some back-of-the-envelope math, if you're going to target 50% from high-growth areas, I think from my math, that implies about $1 billion of additional revenues above -- beyond your gaming consoles. And if you're going for one or two more semi-custom deals, then that implies that these would be big revenue kind of homerun opportunities. Is that a fair way to think about it?","Rory Read","Well, you should look at the 50% objective and target that we are on track to achieve by yearend 2015 as across those key high-growth segments. There's five of them. We're going to see progress, and we mentioned, there was year-to-year progress embedded. There was sequential progress in terms of pro graphics. These are all going to be factors.","And they're also factors, as Devinder highlighted, in the mix to drive the gross margin strategy across the portfolio. What we target is really interesting applications in the semi-custom space where we can partner with an industry leader to create a really differentiated solution. That in hand [ph] generally targets something in the $200 million to $500 million plus lifetime revenue targets.","Mark Lipacis \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","That's very helpful, Rory. Thank you. And then a follow-up question, on the manufacturing process roadmap, Lisa, the -- it looks like your -- Global Foundries signed a partnership or announced a partnership with Samsung to license their technology on fully depleted 14-nanometer FinFETs. You talked about your roadmap to FinFETs, Global Foundries, if they are using fully depleted technologies, is that different than the technology they're currently using? And would that require additional investment by you guys to try to get to that ultimately?","Lisa Su","Sure, Mark. So let me comment on that. So if we look at the overall relationship that Global Foundries signed with Samsung, I think we view that as a good thing. I think it's good for the industry and it's good for AMD relative to collaboration and getting FinFETs to market sooner.","Relative to investment side, I think from that standpoint, we have a roadmap to go to FinFETs, it's a very important technology for us, and I wouldn't see that disagreement, changes or affects that in any way.","Mark Lipacis \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Thank you. Last question if I may. The -- according to 8-K filing, it looks like Mubadala exercised warrants to get to 19% ownership. Are there any implications on steering the direction of the company, or should we read anything into this? How should we think about that? Thank you very much.","Rory Read","Yeah, no problem, Mark. We don't generally comment on our investors' actions and strategies. We have a very strong relationship and focus with our key investors. I think you should probably talk to them in terms of where they're going.","Mark Lipacis \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Fair enough. Thanks.","Operator","And our final question comes from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.","Kevin Cassidy \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Thanks for squeezing me in. The professional GPU business seems to be getting some good momentum. Can you tell us -- give us an idea what type of growth you expect and maybe what percentage of your GPUs it could be this year and next year?","Lisa Su","Yeah, Kevin, let me try to answer that. So the pro graphics business is definitely a growth opportunity for that. You've heard that in our, you know, it's part of those five segment -- five businesses that we think will drive to that 50%.","Without getting into exact numbers, I would say we're quite under-represented in pro graphics right now. And so it's been a key focus item for us to get the right products and drive growth. We saw sequential growth from Q4 to Q1, that was good. We talked about the Apple Mac Pro driving some of the share gains there. And then we've just launched a new W9100 product that is exceptional for the high-end professional workstation market.","So we think it's a great growth opportunity for us, and we'll give more color on that as we progress through the year.","Kevin Cassidy \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. Thank you very much.","Ruth Cotter","Okay, operator, that concludes our first quarter 2014 earnings call. And we'd like to thank everybody for participating this evening.","Operator","Thank you, presenters. And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Again this does conclude today's call.

You'll also find detailed discussions about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC, and in particular AMD's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 24, 2016.","With that, I'd like to hand the call over to Lisa. Lisa?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all of those listening in today. In 2016, we made meaningful progress across the company, strengthening our product offerings, regaining share in key markets, and creating a solid foundation for sustainable growth.","Fourth quarter revenue of $1.11 billion grew 15% from the year ago period, based on a substantial increase in Computing and Graphics segment revenue. Revenue decreased 15% sequentially, based on seasonally lower semi-custom SoC shipments, while we achieved our second straight quarter of Computing and Graphics segment revenue growth. For the full year, growth across both of our business segments resulted in a 7% increase in annual revenue, non-GAAP gross margin expansion, and positive free cash flow.","Looking at our Computing and Graphics segment, on a full year basis, CG annual revenue grew for the first time since 2011, as our focus on strengthening this key part of our business gained momentum. Fourth quarter revenue increased 28% from the year ago period, based on strong GPU and mobile APU sales growth. Our CG quarterly revenue was the highest in two years. Our client revenue was the highest in seven quarters, and we delivered our highest graphics processor revenue in 11 quarters.","Mobile APU shipments and revenue growth accelerated as strong adoption of our 7th generation notebook APUs drove notebook share gains in the quarter. Desktop processor sales increased sequentially and declined from a year ago, in advance of our Ryzen desktop processor launch this quarter. At CES, we highlighted broad design win in ecosystem momentum for Ryzen. 17 different system integrators unveiled Ryzen-based gaming and enthusiast systems and multiple ecosystem partners announced plans to offer a broad range of premium Ryzen motherboards. We have also secured a number of high-end design wins for Ryzen with our global OEMs. We remain on track to launch Ryzen in early March, with widespread system and channel availability expected on day one.","In graphics, strong sales increases across all of our product lines drove a double-digit increase in GPU processor revenue from a year ago. Desktop GPU shipments and revenue increased by double-digit percentages from a year ago, based on growing OEM and channel adoption of Polaris GPUs. Polaris processor sales were particularly strong in the performance and enthusiast portions of the market, resulting in our highest channel GPU sales in more than two years.","Mobile GPU sales growth outpaced desktop in the quarter, and we believe we gained further share in this part of the market as the first Polaris-based notebooks launched. We also launched Radeon Pro 400 mobile GPUs in the quarter. These ultrathin performance GPUs are ideal for mobile content creators, and are powering Apple's latest premium MacBook Pro notebooks.","And in professional graphics, we finished off a record year with record quarterly revenue and unit shipments. Traditional workstation GPU sales grew in the quarter as HP, Dell, and others began offering systems powered by our recently-launched Radeon Pro WX GPUs.","We also continued to make progress in the server GPU market with sales increasing significantly to support new mega datacenter deployments.","As a part of our strategy to drive Radeon GPUs into the datacenter, we announced our Radeon Instinct family of machine intelligence accelerators, and detailed our plans to expand the market for machine learning based on AMD's unique combination of high performance GPUs, CPUs, and open source software.","Turning to our Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom segment, revenue increased 4% from a year ago, driven by growing embedded processor sales and ongoing demand for AMD-powered Microsoft and Sony game consoles. As we expected, revenue declined sequentially following the annual sales peak in the third quarter. 2016 game console sales aligned with our expectations, resulting in new records for semi-custom annual unit shipments and sales.","Embedded processor sales grew by double-digit percentages sequentially and from the year ago period, based on adoption across our targeted vertical markets. And development of our next-generation server CPU, Naples, is on track as we continue to expand the breadth of our customer and partner engagements to enable broad platform ecosystem and software validation work in advance of launch.","Naples is meeting our performance targets and customer response to our competitiveness and differentiated feature set continues to be overwhelmingly positive. As a result, we expanded our design win momentum in both traditional and cloud servers as well as in the embedded infrastructure and communications markets.","As we look back on 2016, we successfully accomplished our key priorities, including growing discrete graphics share, led by Polaris GPU adoption, regaining client compute share, led by our 7th generation APUs, growing in adjacent markets with record annual semi-custom game console revenue and professional graphics, and strengthening the financial foundation of the company by achieving annual non-GAAP operating profitability, reducing debt, and increasing cash.","All of our work for the past two years has been designed to strengthen the technical, operational, and financial foundation of the company. We entered 2017 with strong revenue growth and margin expansion opportunities as we prepare to launch our Zen-based CPUs and Vega GPUs that can return AMD to the high performance markets, where we have not materially participated in recent years. The production ramp, customer adoption, and ecosystem support for our Zen-based desktop processor, Ryzen, are all mapping to our plans.","We also remain on track to expand Zen into the datacenter market in the second quarter, followed by the embedded and notebook markets in the second half of the year. Our Vega GPU development is also progressing to plan. Vega is designed to scale beyond the limitations of current GPUs to enable PC gaming, professional design, and machine intelligence experiences that traditional GPU architectures have not been able to effectively address.","We provided our first performance preview of Vega GPUs earlier in the quarter in advance of the launch planned for the second quarter of this year. Bringing all this together, based on our current market expectations and the strength of our upcoming products, we are confident we can grow annual revenue, expand gross margin, and deliver non-GAAP net income in 2017.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter financial performance.","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. 2016 was a good year for AMD as we grew revenue, improved our financial performance, and strengthened the financial foundation of the company. AMD annual revenue grew 7% year-over-year, with growth in both business segments. We expanded gross margin, maintained essentially flat operating expenses, achieved operating profitability, and reduced net losses significantly. In addition, we improved our balance sheet with strategic capital market transactions that reduced and re-profiled debt and lowered interest expense. Finally, we generated positive free cash flow and ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $1.26 billion.","Now, let me provide the specifics of the fourth quarter of 2016, together with quarterly year-over-year comparisons. Revenue was $1.1 billion, increasing 15% year-over-year, due primarily to higher GPU processor sales, and declining 15% sequentially, driven primarily by seasonally lower sales of our semi-custom SoCs, partially offset by higher sales in the Computing and Graphics segment. Gross margin was 32%, up two percentage points year-over-year and up one percentage point from the prior quarter, due to higher Computing and Graphics segment revenue. Operating expenses were $357 million compared to $323 million a year ago and $353 million in the prior quarter. Both increases were due to ongoing targeted investments in R&D to support our new products.","Net licensing gain associated with our server JV with THATIC was $31 million, up from $24 million in the prior quarter. Operating income was $26 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to an operating loss of $39 million a year ago, and operating income of $70 million in the prior quarter. Operating income is down from the prior quarter due to lower revenue.","Fourth quarter net interest expense, taxes, and other was $34 million, down from $40 million a year ago, and $43 million in Q3 2016, primarily due to reduced interest expense. Net loss was $8 million, or a loss per share of $0.01 calculated using 931 million shares of common stock. This compares to a net loss of $79 million, or $0.10 a year ago, and net income of $27 million, or $0.03 in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $60 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of minus $5 million a year ago, and adjusted EBITDA of $103 million in the third quarter of 2016.","Now, turning to the business segments. Computing and Graphics revenue was $600 million, up 28% year-over-year and up 27% sequentially, primarily due to higher GPU and client processor sales. Computing and Graphics business segment operating loss was $21 million, improving significantly from a loss of $99 million from a year ago, and a loss of $66 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2016.","Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $506 million, up 4% year-over-year and down 39% from the prior quarter, primarily due to lower sales of our semi-custom SoCs. Operating income was $47 million, down from $59 million a year ago, and down from $136 million in the prior quarter. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by higher R&D investments in Q4 2016, partially offset by an IP monetization licensing gain.","Turning to the balance sheet, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.26 billion at the end of the quarter, compared to $785 million a year ago, and $1.26 billion in the prior quarter. Inventory was $751 million compared to $678 million a year ago, and $772 million in the prior quarter. Inventory levels were higher from one year ago, in support of product transitions and higher revenue in the first half of 2017.","Total wafer purchases from GLOBALFOUNDRIES in 2016 was $665 million and $239 million in the fourth quarter. Long-term debt on the balance sheet as of the end of the quarter was $1.44 billion, down from $1.63 billion in the prior quarter, primarily due to debt redemptions. The principal debt amount of $1.77 billion, down from $1.93 billion as of the end of the third quarter of 2016, is reflected on the balance sheet as a carrying value of debt after netting the unamortized discount of our convertible debt and issuance costs.","During the fourth quarter of 2016, we redeemed $268 million principal amount of debt. In addition, we issued $105 million principal amount of 2.125% convertible notes due 2026 as a result of the underwriters exercising the option to purchase an additional 15% of the original issuance, bringing the total principal balance of the convertible notes to $805 million.","Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was $167 million, a significant improvement from $27 million one year ago, and $20 million in the third quarter of 2016.","Turning to our outlook for the first quarter of 2017, which is a 13-week quarter, we expect revenue to decrease 11% sequentially, plus or minus 3%. The midpoint of guidance would result in Q1 2017 revenue increasing approximately 18% year-over-year, gross margin to be approximately 33%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $360 million, interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $30 million, inventory to be approximately flat sequentially.","We look forward to sharing additional 2017 and long-term guidance parameters at our Financial Analyst Day in May.","In closing, we are pleased with the progress we made in 2016. As we begin 2017, we look forward to introducing several new leadership products and remain focused on further improving our financial and operational performance.","With that, I will turn it back to Laura. Laura?","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you, Devinder. Operator, with that, we are ready for our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Our first question today is coming from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Thanks for taking my question. Lisa, I'm hoping that you can help me understand the dynamic of desktop microprocessors ramping down in front of the Ryzen ramp. My understanding was that Ryzen was the higher end SKU that comped against the Core i5 or Core i7, which is above where the existing microprocessors competed in the stack. So, I'm wondering if we should think about Ryzen either cannibalizing the existing desktop microprocessors at a higher ASP or ramping down the lower end, or should we think about Ryzen layering on top of the existing lower end desktop microprocessors? Thanks.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes, absolutely, Mark. Thanks for the question. So, look, you are absolutely right. Ryzen is really a high end desktop product and I think the comment was really around our overall channel inventories in desktops. So, we wanted to ensure a very smooth transition. No question that Ryzen will layer on top, competing well in the Core i7, Core i5 range, but we also will eventually see a full lineup of Ryzen throughout the desktop portfolio.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And a follow-up if I may. Is it fair to assume that as Ryzen ramps into the enthusiast stack that you would expect to see attach rates of AMD graphics cards also kind of increase, I guess I would expect to see higher attach rate of AMD GPUs with the Ryzen. Is that fair?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes, if you look at our product lineup in the first half of the year, I think we have Ryzen launching in early March and then we'll have Vega, our enthusiast GPU launching in the second quarter and so, as we go through the year, I think we're quite pleased with the performance that we are seeing on both of those products. And so, we should see Ryzen doing very well in the high end as well as Vega and by nature, since both of those high end markets are markets that we don't have significant presence today, there will be an opportunity to both gain share as well as increase attach rates in those markets.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","All right. Very helpful. Thank you very much.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thanks, Mark.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you, Mark. Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Matt Ramsay from Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thank you very much. Lisa, since we sort of understand that Ryzen launching here in March is going to lead into relatively the same core that feeds the server microprocessor that launches in the second quarter, maybe you could give us a little bit of update on timing, to the specifics that you can, on the server launch. And specifically, what segments of that market maybe in terms of, I don't know, application segments or percentage of the server TAMs that you might be going after in the first several quarters after you launch the server product. Thanks.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Sure. Absolutely, Matt. So, as you stated, Ryzen and Naples share the same core, the same CPU core, which is our Zen core. Our performance on that core has done very well. We have actually met or exceeded our expectations. So, Ryzen will launch in early March. Naples will launch in the second quarter. We have made very good progress, actually in the last few months with customers really testing the performance capability on their own software and their own application workload.","So, we feel good about where the product is positioned. We expect that the key workload \u2013 Naples really has brought applicability in the server market, but we are especially targeting workloads that will benefit from more threads, higher memory, as well as I\/O-bound applications. So, we expect cloud, big data applications as well as traditional enterprise. And our focus is both with OEMs as well as ODMs to ensure that we have a strong ecosystem ready for that launch.","Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. Thank you. And then a couple of follow-ups for Devinder if I could.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Okay.","Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","I noticed that quite a big ramp year-over-year in growth in the Computing and Graphics segment, but it's still a slight operating loss on the P&L. Maybe you could talk us through maybe as the new product launches in the GPU and CPU segments for the year, how do you think about gross margin in that Computing and Graphics segment and getting that back to profitability? And then quickly, I think you guys guided to $50 million in THATIC IP revenue. Any help about how that is distributed through the year would be really helpful. Thank you.","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes, let me cover the second one first, on the THATIC IP licensing gain. We had $88 million of that in 2016 as you observed, we guided $50 million in 2017. It's really dependent upon milestone deliveries, but I can share with you that based on tracking to those milestones, we expect to recognize approximately half of that, call it $25 million in Q1 of 2017.","And then as far as the second question, on the segment, Computing and Graphics, yes, very good progress. I think year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, we are very pleased with that. The segment loss has gone down significantly from Q4 2015, where we were about $100 million to about $20 million. And with the new products that are coming up, in particular the Ryzen product we just talked about, with better gross margins and other products in the graphics base, we expect to continue to make progress in that segment and reduce the losses and get back to profitability.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes, Matt, and if I can just add to that. I think the key for the Computing and Graphics segment is our participation at the higher end of the market, for both CPUs and GPUs. And as we do that, the margin expansion as well as the revenue growth opportunity are critical to get that business to profitability.","Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you, Matt. Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking my question and good job on the execution. My first question, Lisa, is on the gaming cycle. Because it seems like we have had a number of good years. So, what's your sense of where we are in that cycle, and just near-term, what is your perspective on GPU channel inventory and how you are making sure the channel is not overstocked as you go into your next generation product cycle?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes, absolutely, Vivek. So, on the console market, I think you're right. I think the last few years have been very good from a console cycle standpoint. We finished 2016 with both units and revenue up. As we go into 2017, this is going to be the fifth year of the cycle, so normally, if you look at historicals, it would say that hardware sales might be down. This cycle is a bit different, with both the PlayStation 4 Pro that launched a couple of quarters ago and then the Scorpio, Microsoft Scorpio, that will launch later this year. So, we'll need to see how they do through the year. But, I think from our standpoint, the console business has been a strong business performer for us and we are pleased with that.","Relative to the GPU market, we were very pleased with the performance in Q4, and actually throughout 2016. We got both nice desktop channel as well as notebook acceleration as we went through the year. In terms of channel inventory levels, actually, they looked quite normal. I would say we drained a little bit of inventory in Q4. We would expect a seasonal slowdown as we go into Q1, ahead of our product launches, but nothing unusual in the channel inventory on the GPU side.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Very helpful. And as my follow-up, if you compare AMD versus your top two competitors, Intel and NVIDIA, what are the biggest gaps? Because it seems like you're making good progress on the hardware side with a number of new product launches. What about software? How soon do you think you can close the gap there? Thank you.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes. So, in terms of our strategy, I think on both the CPU and the GPU side, we have been on a fairly deliberate path to ensure that we got to a very competitive roadmap. So, on the CPU side, with Ryzen and Naples, we believe we will be quite competitive. On the GPU side, as we launch Vega, we will have a full stack, sort of top to bottom with new hardware. We continue to invest in software, and our approach to software is really around open source and using the ecosystem and using the community and focused on sort of the new APIs. So in gaming, we are very focused on DX12 and Vulkan and on the professional graphics and on the GPU server side, really using our GPUOpen. So, we'll continue to invest in software. No question that that's really critical for the graphics market, but we feel we are making good progress.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you, Vivek.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, guys, thanks for taking my questions. First, on the gross margins, I was a little surprised, given the fairly powerful mix shift between Computing and EESC that you had, that they weren't higher. In fact, they came in about 20 basis points below guidance. I guess, could you elaborate on the drivers in the quarter and the drivers going forward into the next quarter, what we should expect?","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes. I think, Stacy, good question. It's basically the product mix within the quarter. Q4, if you look at Q4 in particular, we were at 31% gross margin Q2 and Q3 and Q4. It stepped up to 32%. And in Q1 we're guiding at 33%. But, really, it's a function of the product mix. And you've got to recall that if you're talking about Q4, this is ahead of launching the products we just talked about in terms of Ryzen, which we expect to be shipping in the early March timeframe.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks. For my follow-up, I know you talked about EESC being seasonally down and we're expecting it to be down, but how did it stack up, actually, versus your expectations overall? Why was there such a big deceleration year-over-year versus Q3 where you went from kind of up 31% year-over-year to up 4%?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes, actually, Stacy, it was very much in line with our expectations. If you look at our Q3, our Q3 was actually very strong, and that was the quarter where there were significant builds ahead of the holiday launches. So, when you look at the console cycle, in general, they tend to build really for holiday. And so, July, August, September, October are big build months. November is like half a month, and then it decelerates in December. So, it was not unexpected and actually performed in line with our expectations.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I guess, so why was the build so strong in Q3 than relative, was that \u2013 year-over-year, was that just like the PlayStation Pro or was there something else going on in Q3 that took it up so much year-over-year versus Q4?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes, it was new product. And if you look, in addition to the PS4 Pro, they also, both console manufacturers had new systems that they launched in that timeframe, as well.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you, guys.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thanks, Stacy.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for letting me ask a question. Lisa, one for you or Devinder. For the first quarter, and then perhaps more importantly, for the full year, can you just talk a little bit about the dynamics between your two segments? You guide down 11% for the first quarter, which is above or below that number. And then, how does mix change throughout the year, as you have a bunch of new products launching on one side of the equation, but perhaps not as many on the EESC side?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes, sure, Ross. So, for Q1, I think if you look at the overall \u2013 the guidance sequentially down 11%, you would expect that the Semi-Custom business should be down more than that, and you've seen that in our numbers the past couple of years. So, it's behaving as it normally would. Sequentially, you would expect that the Computing and Graphics segment would be better than seasonal, given that we'll have one month of Ryzen in the market.","On a year-over-year basis, I would say the Computing and Graphics business is where you're seeing the majority of the growth as we go into Q1, with both GPU as well as Ryzen driving that growth. As we go forward in the year, I think the expectations are that the product launches tend to be faster in the CG segment. In other words, from launch to revenue ramp it's faster because it's more consumer-based. So, as we launch Ryzen in first quarter and Vega in second quarter and then the notebook and embedded in the second half, you would expect to see that reflected.","On the EESC side of the business, we do have our Microsoft Scorpio design win that will ramp in the year, and that's an important one from the Semi-Custom side. And we'll see Naples ramp, as well, albeit server will tend to be a little bit slower from design win to revenue ramp. We would expect some contribution in the second half of the year.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. And then for my follow-up, one perhaps for either of you, again. How do we think about the OpEx side of things as we go through the year? And I know you purposely didn't guide to it in your 2017 as a whole, but conceptually, when you're launching a bunch of new products, is it fair to assume that the SG&A side of things could support those launches' increases? Any sort of color you can give about your philosophy on OpEx would be helpful.","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes, I think our philosophy, first of all, is to be very disciplined about managing the OpEx. We did that, as you saw in the 2014-2015 timeframe. In 2016, we made some very targeted investments to products, which is, with the launches that are happening in 2017. I'd say they are going to pay off in terms of all the products we have on track to launch in 2017. We have invested in software. We have got, obviously, some go-to-market expenses as we get into 2017. But I would say that you see our guidance for Q1 2017 at $360 million.","So, you will see a trend of continuing investment in product roadmap, new product launches, software. R&D, if you look at it on a year-on-year basis, is up, actually close to $50 million and SG&A was down, even though we were essentially flat on OpEx 2015 to 2016. And, I think, as you look at 2017, we'll continue to stay lean in SG&A and prioritize investments in R&D for the go-forward execution of our plans going into future years.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Chris Rolland from Susquehanna International Group. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Adam Jackson Rolland - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hey, guys. On the server side, you guys talked about Naples and, Lisa, you mentioned more threads, higher memory, and I\/O. With these products, do you anticipate taking more share in the cloud? Or how do you think you're going to fare versus kind of enterprise, storage, coms, high performance? Is it going to be a lot more kind of cloud-centric?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Chris, the great thing about Naples is it really is a general purpose product. So, we will play in all of those segments. I think the cloud tends to move a bit faster in terms of just, again, from design win to revenue. So, we certainly are very focused in the cloud, but I'm also quite enthusiastic about our opportunities in traditional enterprise as well as some of the storage and networking spaces.","Christopher Adam Jackson Rolland - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Great. And then, with, let's say, Summit Ridge and Vega and Naples all coming online here, can you guys talk about where these products, the gross margins are versus either your corporate average or a comparable product now? And if things ramp the way you expect them to, when might you hit the low end of your long-term gross margin range?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","So, maybe, Chris, I'll start and Devinder can add. Clearly, you mentioned some of the key products that are margin drivers for us. So, Ryzen in high end desktop, our server CPUs, server GPUs, professional graphics, are all north of the corporate average. We still have game consoles, which will be a significant piece of our business that will be less than corporate average. So, our expectation is that we will make progress with margins as we ramp these products. Relative to when we'll hit the long-term guidance, I think we'll defer that perhaps to our Analyst Day and note that the target is still to be within the 36% to 40% range on a long-term model.","Christopher Adam Jackson Rolland - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thanks so much and great quarter.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thanks, Chris.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Hemmelgarn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, this is Chris Hemmelgarn on for Blayne. Thanks very much for letting us on to ask a question and congrats on a good quarter and guidance. I guess first of all, a number of questions have touched on this, but with Ryzen launching and Vega in Q2, you presumably see some pretty big channel fill in Q1 and into Q2. Could you just talk about how you see that impacting seasonality through the rest of the year? Q3, Q4 normally bigger quarters for PC sales, but you got big product launches in the first half.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Well, we are certainly looking forward to those product launches and the way we view it is, yes, there's some bit of channel fill, but I think there is also some pent up demand for really great products in the gaming space. Both Ryzen and Vega are targeted at those enthusiast gamers. So, certainly we do expect normal seasonality, would say that the second half would be stronger. Note that on Ryzen, we are starting first in the channel and with system integrators and then OEMs will launch shortly thereafter. So, you'd expect a stage launch of our partners.","Christopher Hemmelgarn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","It's very helpful, Lisa, thanks. And then just as a follow-up, so, you've announced your first non-game console semi-custom win launching this year. As that business has matured, can you talk how you see further opportunities to grow outside of the core game console market there?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes, so, we have talked about three design wins and those are in progress now. In terms of ongoing engagements, we have a nice pipeline. We continue to view semi-custom as a strategic way for us to utilize our IP in our design capability. And so, we'll continue to view that as one of our go-to markets for the IP that we are developing. And we'll talk more about sort of the semi-custom opportunities as we go forward.","Christopher Hemmelgarn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you, Chris. Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ambrish Srivastava \u2013 I'm sorry, our next question is coming from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yes, good afternoon, guys. Lisa, congratulations on the strong results for 2016. I guess I wanted to go back with my first question to the OpEx line and if you just look at total dollars spent, you're spending well below your two main competitors. And I'm just kind of curious, as revenue growth starts to kind of reemerge in the model, how should you think about or how should we think about OpEx growth relative to revenue growth? Is there a target that you can give us that you'd like OpEx to grow half as fast as revenue, or are you at a point now where you see a lot of incremental investments that are worth doing that might have OpEx growth growing faster than that? Any guidance there would be helpful.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes, certainly, John. So, look, I think we have shown that we can be very disciplined with OpEx and I think we will ensure that \u2013 OpEx will certainly not grow faster than revenue. So that won't happen. I think the opportunity for leverage does exist longer-term in our model. But in the short-term, I'm very focused on ensuring that we execute our product roadmap really, really well. And so, this year, it's about our product launches making sure that we have the right software investments and go-to-market. We are going to see improvement in the financial performance as a result of the margin expansion and we'll look to find leverage on the OpEx line I think in the longer-term as we continue to make progress. But again, we will be very disciplined on the OpEx line.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","No. That's helpful, Lisa. And then I guess as my second question, just going back on the gross margin for Ryzen and Vega. I guess can you help me understand just given where in the stack those two parts will compete, why they shouldn't have gross margins that are more comparable to your two closest peers? Is that kind of the internal target, is that how we should be thinking about it? Or any guidance there would be awesome.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes, so, I think for the high end parts, both Ryzen and Vega, and Naples frankly, we should expect that they are well above our corporate average in terms of margin. As it relates to our competitors, I think that's a harder question. But our goal is to make sure that we have very competitive product on a pure performance basis. And so, that's been the goal and that's certainly how we are viewing it. But we will also have some opportunity for price performance leverage as we gain share in the market. So, I think where we are positioning the products is the right place and the right balance between revenue growth and margin and we'll certainly look for every opportunity to improve our margins over time.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you, guys.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Joe L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. I guess the question I get most frequently is sort of Zen looks pretty exciting in 2017, but you're competing with Intel who has got 10nm product coming. And how do we think about this on a multi-year basis, Zen as the springboard to compete with them and anything you can share in terms of the product roadmap and sort of the longer-term competitiveness of these products you're introducing now?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Sure, Joe. So, look, we do think Zen is very, very competitive for where we are. In terms of our longer-term roadmap, I think as with anything, for top OEM customers, especially server datacenter customers, they are investing in a roadmap. So, they are not just buying a point product and we have a multi-generational roadmap that we are working on, including sort of the Zen 2 and the Zen 3 follow on. From our standpoint process technology, we ramped 16nm and 14nm really well last year and into this year. We are actually in the process of developing now in 7nm and we think the 7nm foundry roadmaps that are available are very competitive and will ensure that we have a strong multi-generational roadmap.","Joe L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thanks, Joe.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you, Joe.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Yes, hi, thanks, guys. Sorry to beat up on this, but when you look at Radeon Instinct GPUs and the Vega architecture in 2Q 2017 and first half 2017 here. Are the gross margins more in the 40% to 60% range, I think going to datacenter versus what your existing margins are?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Vijay, I think it's fair to say that both professional graphics and our Radeon Instinct line are higher than the normal consumer GPU products in terms of margin, and we view the datacenter GPUs as a great growth opportunity for us and so it's a key area of focus.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Got it. And you mentioned GPUs seeing traction in multiple-threaded applications, and so with that strength there especially with (44:15) what are your expectations for growth in that market? Obviously, you're going from zero, but incrementally what should that drive in revenues for AMD? Thanks.","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes, so, again, we view GPU servers as a very good growth opportunity for us. We are starting from a small base, but we have had some really good engagements with cloud customers and we had some meaningful revenue in the second half of 2016 and we expect it to be a growth driver for us into 2017 and beyond.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you.","Lisa T.

Our next question is coming from Kevin Cassidy from Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for taking my question. On your Zen product lineup, you'll have an APU in the second half of the year? And what kind of GPU would that have on it?","Lisa T.

Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Will that be targeted for both desktop and notebook?","Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes, it will be, but it's a very strong notebook part when you think about sort of the high end notebooks, 2-in-1s, and those types of things. But yes, it can also be used in desktop.","Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Please proceed with your question.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi, thank you. I had a question on inventory, Devinder. You did give us a reason for why the inventory is higher, but what I'm trying to understand is why the delta between the guidance that you'd given which was supposed to be in the $660 million amount, which you guided to? Was there a change in what you were expecting for the roadmap? Was it uncertainty that you had guided to $660 million and now you came up to the number that you reported on the fourth quarter? Thank you.","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes, I think it's fair to say that from the time I gave the guidance $660 million coming in at $750 million, there were some changes. But let me explain. First of all, it was higher than anticipated due to product ramps, product mix and also a higher expected revenue in the first half of 2017. We also had an opportunity to purchase some inventory in a tight PC supply environment at commercially favorable terms, and we took the opportunity to go ahead and purchase the inventory, given what we see from a revenue standpoint for the first half of 2017.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay.

You'll also find detailed discussions about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC, and in particular, AMD's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 1, 2017.","Now, with that, I will hand the call over to Lisa. Lisa?","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. Q2 was a strong quarter for us as we continued to ramp our high-performance product portfolio. Second quarter revenue increased 19% to $1.22 billion, and gross margin improved year-over-year. Importantly, we returned to non-GAAP net income profitability in the quarter, driven by strong growth in our Computing and Graphics segment.","Looking at our Computing and Graphics segment, we made excellent progress in the quarter and reported operating profitability for the first time in three years based on our leadership Ryzen processor and GPU product offerings.","The expansion and growing adoption of our Ryzen CPUs, combined with our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year Graphics revenue growth, resulted in a 51% increase in Computing and Graphics segment sales year-over-year.","Client computing revenue increased by strong double-digit percentage from a year ago, driven by a significant ramp and strong sell-through of our Ryzen CPUs in the first full quarter of sales. Our Ryzen family of processors drove a richer mix of shipments and client ASPs improved significantly from a year ago.","All major PC OEMs have announced premium Ryzen-based desktop systems, with widespread availability expected for the back-to-school and holiday seasons. As we move into the second half of 2017, we are on track to complete the full family of Ryzen processors, including Ryzen 3 processors targeting the mainstream and value market segments with on-Shop availability later this week; Ryzen Threadripper products for the high-end desktop markets with global component channel availability in early August; Ryzen PRO-based offerings targeting the commercial client segments with availability in Q3; and Ryzen Mobile APUs, which will be available for the consumer market later this year.","In Graphics, GPU revenue increased by a strong double-digit percentage from year ago, with higher unit shipments and ASPs driving growth across our desktop and mobile GPU products. Demand for Radeon RX GPUs was strong in the quarter, driven by gaming and cryptocurrency mining.","In June, we began the introduction of our Vega GPU architecture with the launch of the Radeon Vega Frontier Edition, delivering a powerful professional workstation graphics card designed to tackle demanding design, rendering and machine intelligence workloads.","Apple announced that our Radeon Pro Vega product will power the new iMac Pro, a workstation-class product line designed for creators running the most demanding workflows. In addition, Apple also announced expanded iMac offerings, which are powered by the Radeon Pro 500 Series.","We will launch additional Radeon Vega products at SIGGRAPH next week, expanding further in the premium portions of the consumer and professional GPU markets. Our investments in GPU compute and Radeon Instinct are continuing to build momentum. We introduced our first Vega-based Radeon Instinct datacenter products in June. These new GPU accelerators will significantly increase performance, efficiency and ease of implementation for machine learning and high-performance computing workloads.","We also showcased a server powered by AMD's EPYC SoC and four Radeon Instinct MI25 accelerators working together to deliver groundbreaking performance of 100 teraFLOPS. Interest and excitement are high as we recently started shipments of our Radeon Instinct MI25 accelerators to strategic datacenter customers.","Turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, revenue declined 5% year-over-year and increased 44% sequentially. The sequential revenue gains were primarily based on higher Semi-Custom product shipments due to seasonality. In addition, we reached an important milestone in the quarter, delivering initial EPYC server revenue.","In our semi-custom business, unit shipments were up sequentially and down year-over-year as we enter the fifth year of the current game console sales cycle. This console cycle continues to outpace previous cycles as Sony recently passed a milestone of 60 million PlayStation 4 consoles shipped.","Last month, Microsoft announced the new Xbox One X with availability in November. This system will be Microsoft's smallest and most powerful Xbox ever made and will be based on the combination of high-performance CPU and GPU IP that only AMD can provide. As we look at the remainder of the year and given the maturity of the current game console cycle, we expect semi-custom revenue to be down for the full year.","In our server business, last month, we launched our EPYC family of high-performance datacenter processors, reentering the incredibly important $16 billion datacenter market and setting several new industry performance records. With up to 32 high-performance Zen cores and an unparalleled feature set, our EPYC family of processors deliver greater competitive performance at every price point across a full range of integer, floating point, memory bandwidth and I\/O benchmarks and workloads. Our two-socket and one-socket EPYC CPUs are designed to deliver industry-leading performance on critical enterprise, cloud and machine intelligence workloads and provide a substantial TCO advantage.","At our EPYC launch event, we were joined by more than 20 leading server manufacturers and global ecosystem partners who showcased optimized support and EPYC-optimized platforms. We received compelling endorsements from OEM, cloud providers and mega datacenter operators, including HP Enterprise, Dell, Baidu, and Microsoft Azure, with more than 20 EPYC-based platforms announced at launch. And we expect an additional 20 EPYC platforms to be available in the second half of 2017. With the strong global ecosystem and customer interest we have built around our EPYC processor family, we are on track to reenter the datacenter market in a major way.","In closing, we are very pleased with the trend of our quarterly results and how our products are positioned heading into the back half of the year. Our business foundation and growth opportunities are strong, based on our high-performance product portfolio and our expanding customer traction.","Given our first half 2017 performance and our visibility into the third quarter, we are happy to report we are progressing ahead of our annual revenue guidance and we look forward to a strong year overall.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our second quarter financial performance. Devinder?","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon everyone. For the second quarter of 2017, AMD revenue grew 19% and gross margin expanded on a year-over-year basis, driven by a 51% year-over-year revenue increase in our Computing and Graphics segment. We achieved non-GAAP profitability on both an operating and net basis with net income of $19 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.02. Let me provide more specifics for the quarter.","Gross margin was 33%, up 2 percentage points year-over-year due to a richer product mix and a higher percentage of revenue from our Computing and Graphics segment, driven by the first full quarter of Ryzen processor sales. Operating expenses were $381 million compared to $342 million a year ago. The increase was due primarily to higher graphics and datacenter R&D related investments.","Net licensing gain from our server JV with THATIC was $25 million compared to $26 million a year ago, and we have recognized a total of approximately $140 million of net licensing gain to-date. The remaining payments are related to production milestones and are expected to occur in 2018 and beyond.","Operating income was $49 million in the second quarter of 2017, a significant improvement from an operating income of $3 million a year ago.","Second quarter net interest expense, taxes and other was $30 million, down from $43 million a year ago, primarily due to a lower overall interest rate and a lower debt balance. Net income was $19 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.02, as compared to a net loss of $40 million, or loss per share of $0.05 a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was $84 million compared to $36 million a year ago and $28 million in the prior quarter.","Now turning to the business segments. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $659 million, up 51% year-over-year and up 11% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by demand for our Ryzen desktop processors and graphics processors. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $7 million, the first quarterly operating profit in three years, compared to a loss of $81 million a year ago. The significant improvement was primarily due to higher revenue and an improved product mix.","Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $563 million, down 5% year-over-year, primarily due to lower semi-custom SoC sales. Revenue was up 44% sequentially due to the seasonal semi-custom ramp. Additionally in the quarter, we reached an important milestone and recognized initial revenue from EPYC datacenter processor shipments. Operating income was $42 million, down from $84 million a year ago, due primarily to lower revenue and higher datacenter related R&D investments.","Turning to the balance sheet, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $844 million at the end of the quarter compared to $943 million at the end of the prior quarter, due primarily to changes in working capital, largely driven by wafer purchases in anticipation of stronger revenue growth in the third quarter.","Inventory at the end of the quarter was $833 million, down slightly from the prior quarter of $839 million. Long-term debt on the balance sheet was $1.38 billion. Total principal debt, including our secured revolving line of credit, was $1.74 billion. In Q2, we repurchased $40 million of term debt, utilizing our lower-cost secured revolving line of credit. Free cash flow was negative $94 million, due primarily to changes in working capital, largely driven by wafer purchases.","Turning to our outlook for the third quarter of 2017, which is a 13-week quarter, we expect revenue to increase approximately 23% sequentially, plus or minus 3%. At the midpoint, this equates to revenue growth of approximately 15% year-over-year. We now expect: annual 2017 revenue to increase a mid- to high-teens percentage year-over-year compared to our prior guidance of low double-digit growth; non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 34%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $400 million; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $28 million; and inventory to be down sequentially.","Third quarter diluted share count for modeling non-GAAP EPS is expected to be approximately 1.14 billion. This includes shares related to our 2026 Convertible Senior Notes and the warrant held by Mubadala entity. Additional information regarding diluted share count calculation can be found in the CFO Commentary.","In closing, Q2 was a strong quarter, and our financial performance continues to improve. As Lisa shared in her remarks, our business continues to strengthen as we ramp new high-performance products and expand our presence in premium markets. We are pleased with the strong growth in revenue, coupled with improving gross margin on the back of focused execution, financial discipline and ongoing strategic investments in the business.","With that, I'll turn it back to Laura. Laura?","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you. Thank you, Devinder. And, Operator, we're ready for our first question to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question today is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on getting back into the black on C&G. The question is on EPYC, and I'm hoping that you can provide us some more color about how the reception is going and how we should think about milestones going forward. And I'm wondering if you can tell us about the number of different trials or where you're seeing the most traction? And when you would expect this to ship into production environment in the Super 7 cloud guys? Thank you.","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Sure, Mark. Thanks for your questions. So we are very pleased with the reception to EPYC. The launch that we did in June was very well-received. We had a number of customers as well as partners, OEM providers, ODM guys, as well as cloud providers who participated in that. The general reception has been very positive. I would say that interest level is very high. In fact, we're adding additional customer support to really ensure that we help customers get their platforms up and running.","In terms of what to expect in the revenue ramp, we started shipping early volume in the second half of June. We would expect that we continue to ramp that revenue through the second half of the year. We would expect some additional customer announcements in the second half of the year.","And then as we stated with both cloud and the enterprise accounts, depending on their qualification cycles, it can take anywhere up to four quarters to qualify the parts. But so far so good. I think very good traction, and we continue to lean in hard on the datacenter opportunities.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. That's very helpful. And a follow-up, if I may. You mentioned crypto as helping the GPU side. That can be a dual-edged sword. And I was wondering if you can help, perhaps, quantify like what that did to the upside? And is there any way to manage the risk of the minors breaking down their systems and putting it to the secondary market when the currency comes back down? Thank you.","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Sure, Mark. So certainly the overall quarter for Graphics was strong. Q2 tends to be seasonally down, and we were up in the quarter. So it was better than seasonal. I would say the better performance was due to two things. First of all, we did launch our RX 580 and RX 570 gaming cards in April. And those cards are very, very well-positioned in the market, so they're doing well with gamers.","Relative to cryptocurrency, we have seen some elevated demand. If you look at GPUs across the world, the inventory in the channel is actually quite lean. And so we're working on replenishing that inventory.","Our priority, though, really is on our core market, which is the gaming market. And so a couple of things that we are certainly doing are we're prioritizing supply towards the gaming market. So you'll see system integrators, as well as on some of the major e-tailers we have bundles with Ryzen and Radeon.","And then some of our partners are also offering mining specific cards that have a different feature set, such that we're really segmenting the market between gaming and mining. But it's important to say we didn't have cryptocurrency in our forecast, and we're not looking at it as a long-term growth driver. But we'll certainly continue to watch the developments around the blockchain technologies as they go forward.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Very helpful. Thank you.","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thanks, Mark.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Operator, Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Matt Ramsay from Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Lisa, I wanted to ask a little bit about the longer-term road map in your businesses across the CPU and GPU side. It occurs to me and there are some of the conversations we've had, particularly in the enterprise markets of high-end desktop and server that some of the purchasing decisions made by your customers might be sort of dictated by how confident they are in the long-term road map that you guys are putting together as you move to 7-nanometer versus just the products that you've launched so far. So maybe you could talk a little bit about the road maps, how they're developing, and the progress that the team is seeing on the 7-nanometer front. Thanks.","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Sure, Matt. So, look, I think the overall road map execution has been very good, very solid. I think our customers see that Ryzen performance, the EPYC performance on the CPU side, and then certainly the Vega performance on the GPU side have met our commitments.","And the important thing, particularly in the enterprise market, as well as the commercial market, having a road map \u2013 a strong road map with multiple generations is important. We stated at our Financial Analyst Day that we're already investing heavily in 7-nanometer. The 7-nanometer will be key for us on both the CPU and the GPU side. And I would say that development is progressing well. We're working with multiple foundries on that. We have multiple design teams that are working, and we expect that that will give us a strong competitive road map for the next several generations.","Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","All right. Thank you for that, Lisa. And a couple questions quickly for Devinder. I guess the first one is on share count. There was obviously some movement higher in the share count due to the in the money converts. Maybe you could talk us through if you were modeling maybe your business on a long term from an earnings power perspective, how would you think about modeling that share count?","And then secondly, on the operating expense line, there's plenty to invest in here. But how should we think about that as we move through the year and into next year? Thanks.","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you, Matt. I think on the share count, basically, beyond the basic shares, the dilutive impact comes from three components. You have the employee equity grants. You have the 75 million share warrant that we issued to Mubadala in 2016. And you have the 101 million shares underlying our $805 million convertible note.","The good news is that you start making money and you get beyond inflection points. All of that gets included in diluted share count. So I think given what we have laid out as guidance, in particular in the Financial Analyst Day, the assumption should be as you model profitability in the company, those shares get included. We have provided color in the commentary. And for Q3, we're estimating that the total share count is about $1.14 billion (sic) [1.14 billion shares].","As far as the OpEx is concerned, we are obviously with the strength in the business performing stronger. We are making targeted investments, particularly in R&D. We have included and invested in targeted R&D areas. And also in 2017, I think there are some employee-related performance incentives that are included in our current guidance given the fact that the business is performing stronger than anticipated. Lisa, anything you want to add?","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah. No, I think you covered it, Devinder. On the investment front, Matt, just to give you a little bit more color on that, I think we see tremendous opportunity in the datacenter around both CPU and GPU compute. And so we're taking the opportunity with some of the strength in the business to make sure we lean in to those resources and fully pay off the product investments.","Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for letting me ask a question. Lisa, one for you first on the client ASPs. I know the Ryzen side, the mix had to go up, and those carry much better ASPs, but the client category as a whole the ASPs went down. So if you just think about going forward, when do the size of the buckets work, the Ryzen contribution will be big enough to offset whatever was the headwind against that in the second quarter?","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah. Good question, Ross. When you take a look at our client business, think of it as desktop and mobile. And then within the desktop segment, it's channel and OEM. So Ryzen performed very well. I think the ASP contribution is very evident on the desktop line item. But when we look at where we are in the progression of the Ryzen rollout, we're still in the early innings. So we had our first full quarter of Ryzen Desktop in the channel. The OEMs launch their desktop products in about mid-June, and so they just started selling at the end of June. And that will flow through into the second half of the year.","And the mobile products are still our legacy products. So you saw the mobile ASPs were down slightly as we went from Q1 to Q2, and that was just a mix on some of the legacy business. But the desktop ASPs were quite strong. And we should expect that as we go into the second half of the year and we have Ryzen really take off in the OEM sectors as well as once we introduce Ryzen Mobile towards the second half of the year is when you'll see sort of more of the full portfolio over to Ryzen. Does that help?","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","It does. And a related follow-up on that is just transitioning those ASP and mix commentaries over to the actual gross margin. The full-year revenue guidance is increased again. Just recently you guys did it at the Analyst Meeting. Now you're doing it again. So that's clearly a positive. It seems like the C&G side of things is what's driving that, given your commentary in the game console side being down. So given everything you just said about the mix improving in the back half of the year and the revenues now being higher, I'm a little surprised the gross margin guidance didn't change for the year. So if we translate everything you just said, Lisa, to a gross margin dynamic, can you help us kind of make all of that make sense as well?","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes. So I think you summarized the revenue guidance well. I think we see the Computing and Graphics business accelerating on the strength of the new products. We do have a bit of a year-over-year headwind when we compare game consoles. When you look at our Q3 margin guidance, we are certainly up year-over-year 3 points, and so I think that's the strength of the product portfolio. I think as we get into the Q4 guidance, we'll talk more about the margin progression. But what we expected in terms of margin expansion with the premium products is certainly playing out, and that's helping the Q3 guide.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from David Wong from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Can you give us some idea of whether your September guidance assumes any meaningful contribution from Vega sales for gaming in the September quarter?","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes, David. We will be launching Vega, actually, in a week at SIGGRAPH. And yes, Vega will be shipping into gaming, into professional workstations, as well as into the GPU compute segment in the third quarter.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And can you update us on your expectations for launch timing of Ryzen notebook chips and if you expect there to be revenues from Ryzen notebook in December?","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes. So Ryzen notebook is on track to launch for the holiday platform sales, and so you should see OEMs launching Ryzen Mobile for the holiday period. So yes, we will see revenue in the second half of the year.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks very much.","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thanks, David.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thanks, David. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","My question, first one, was on free cash flow. It's negative again, and for the first half, minus $420 million if my math is right. So, Devinder, when does free cash flow turn positive? And then I had a follow-up, please.","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah, I think 2016, if you go back and look at the full year, because of the seasonality of our business, we were positive. From a viewpoint of midpoint of 2017, we do see strength in the business. You are right, cash is down with the changes in working capital, and it's largely driven by wafer purchases in support of the stronger second half and, in particular, the stronger business that we are seeing. We expect cash to be up for the quarter this quarter and to be free cash flow positive for the year.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then my follow-up is, Lisa, on the crypto question that Mark had asked earlier, I'm not sure you gave an answer to, or maybe Mark didn't ask that, are you seeing follow-on strength from that in the current quarter? And we realize it's not a core part of your business, but why or why not is it not similar to what happened in 2014? Thank you.","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Sure, Ambrish. So I think from an overall standpoint, we see strong demand in graphics for the third quarter. I think that's a mix of a couple things. That's a mix of gaming being seasonally stronger in the third quarter. That's a mix of inventories being very low in the channel. And there is a crypto \u2013 probably, a cryptocurrency component as well relative to overall demand.","When we look at it as a whole, though, we think that the growth in the business is really on the strength of the products and how the design wins, both OEM and as well as system integrators are improving.","Now, how is it different than sort of a couple of years ago? I think we understand the market much better from the standpoint of the products are significantly stronger. And so if you look at the product portfolio, not just the current sort of Polaris or RX 5 Series products, but the Vega product coming in, really opens up a larger TAM for us.","And we are working with our add-in board partners to segment the markets in terms of the feature set that go into the cards, as well as prioritizing some of the gamer ecosystems. So in terms of system integrator supply as well as bundling and OEM supply. So I think we are doing quite a bit to make sure that we protect against any downside as it relates to cryptocurrency. But overall, I would view it as GPUs are strong, and we see GPUs continuing to be strong, and so it's a great market to be in.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Kevin Cassidy from Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin Edward Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for taking my question. And maybe just as a follow-up to that, inventories being down going into this quarter and with all your new product ramps, is it down mainly just because of GPUs, or is there something else?","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","I think it's \u2013 if you look at the inventory, in fact, if you look at it from my standpoint, the strength of the business, there's revenue growth, we're obviously buying wafers in support of the stronger revenue. Some of the ramp in new products does have an impact on the inventory, want to support all of the new product ramps. It's down marginally in the quarter, but I expect that in Q3 it will go down. And then we have previously guided down year over year, so I expect when we end the year, it'll be down in 2017 compared to 2016, while fully supporting the needs of the business.","Kevin Edward Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And I guess for the server side, how are you building inventory for that? Or is that a longer design cycle so that you don't really start building inventory?","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","I think the server side...","Kevin Edward Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","For the EPYC.","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah, it's a smaller portion. I mean, the ramp in EPYC, as you probably heard us say, is slower than in other businesses, so from \u2013 if you look at it, total inventory, the server portion of inventory is not that huge.","Kevin Edward Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the good sales growth. Lisa, for my first question, if I go back in history, at one point, AMD had a 20% plus share in server CPUs, and I appreciate we are far off from that point right now, but I just want to know conceptually, what are you doing or can do to recreate those conditions? Or do you think the environment is very different this time around?","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah, Vivek, I think we are actually very pleased with sort of the conditions around the server market for us. I mean, it all starts as a good product or a great product. And so I think the EPYC product performance is very important.","But I think the other conditions that are different and perhaps even more favorable than in the past is the fact that the cloud datacenter guys are making up such a large piece of the market and they tend to move faster in their qualification cycles given the fact that they have more control of their own software environment. So I think our differentiation is strong. I think we have \u2013 we put out a product that is not only strong on basic CPU performance, but also offers much more flexibility in terms of what you can do with memory and I\/O. I think that value proposition is recognized by the customer set. So we certainly are looking to ramp the revenue as fast as possible.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And for my follow-up, as you are starting to become more competitive against Intel and NVIDIA, are you seeing a competitive response from them in terms of pricing or features or go-to-market strategy that you might need to respond to?","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Obviously, we continue to watch the competitive market. It's been an exciting market. Some would say from a product standpoint there has been a bit of back-and-forth already. We feel good about how our products are positioned not just today, but how they will be positioned over the next 18 to 24 months. And so we're going to be very focused on ensuring that we lead with the product message. Of course, there's a go-to-market element and all of that around that, but I think the competitive environment right now is very focused on product competitiveness.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And maybe a quick follow-up on that, Lisa, if I might. When Ryzen initially rolled out, I think some of the benchmarks were not up to par. Have you seen an improvement in that? And especially as you roll out EPYC, are you seeing the ecosystem come and work around your product, so those benchmarks are not going to be an issue this time around?","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah. So I think, Vivek, you're referring to when we initially launched Ryzen 7, there were some games, particularly in 1080p resolution, that were not as good as some of the higher resolutions. I believe we've worked around a lot of that. We've seen game developers, content developers really sort of support the Ryzen ecosystem.","I've actually been very happy with how they've jumped on the support of it. We have been continuing to improve the ecosystem, so if you look at the motherboards and if you look at the memory capability, they've significantly improved just in last three or four months. I think you'll see as we go through Threadripper launch, which is coming up very shortly, that the Ryzen ecosystem is strong.","And as it relates to EPYC, I think very similar comments. I think the ecosystem has been very supportive of the EPYC processor family, and so I don't see that as an issue.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thanks, Vivek. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Hi, Joe.","Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about, as we think about EPYC for next year, how do you think we should frame that opportunity? Is it mostly a cloud sort of top-tier cloud customer that's going to drive that revenue? Is it sort of next level down cloud customer going to drive significant revenue and then enterprise next year? I mean, how would you sort of bucket those three things in terms of where the EPYC potential lies?","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah. I would say, Joe, we have a broad set of customers that we're engaging with. So, definitely we see top-tier cloud guys very engaged with EPYC and talking about a number of different instances. Microsoft Azure was at our launch event, and Baidu was at our launch event, and we're working with a number of other cloud vendors as well.","But we also have a very strong OEM support base as well. So with HPE and Dell putting out a number of platforms with EPYC, I think that will ramp enterprise customers in 2018 as well. So I view it as really both sides of the equation are important for 2018. I think we will see cloud be a little lumpier, so certainly they tend to buy in stages. So they may be a little bit lumpier, but I think overall we are very focused on both cloud and enterprise accounts.","Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you for that. And then circling back quickly to the inventory issues that you talked about in graphics, it seems like they're quite lean and in some cases in shortage. Is that completely a function of demand? Were there any supply issues in the quarter? And how quickly \u2013 do you perceive that as an issue? And if so like how quickly do you fix it?","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah. Joe, it was completely a function of demand, demand within lead time. I think from a supply standpoint we've had a very strong supply chain across the board, across both CPU and GPUs. We are, as I said, in the process of catching up to demand, and so we're certainly increasing some of the production, and that was Devinder's comment about some of the working capital and some of the inventory comments.","Overall, though, I think we're going into a stronger second half of the year. So it's not unexpected for us to ramp up production. It's just demand was quite strong, particularly in the April, May timeframe is when we saw a spike, and it takes some time to react to those signals.","Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Hans Mosesmann from Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Hans Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Hey, Lisa, can you give us a sense of how EPYC is doing in virtualized environments? There might be some issues regarding compatibility with the other x86 suppliers and how you would go through that process over the next several quarters. Thank you.","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah. Again, Hans, I think we have been working closely with a number of different customers, including in virtualized environments. We see no particular issues, other than just getting their platforms up and running. And so I think we continue to believe EPYC will do very well in those environments.","Hans Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then as a follow-up, can you give us a sense now that EPYC is out, what the feedback is from your customers, cloud or OEM, regarding your packaging approach in terms of using a multi-chip module type approach versus a monolithic silicon approach?","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah. Hans, actually, the feedback has been actually quite good. And I think, what we are able to do \u2013 obviously, it's a decision to make, right? We could've built one big monolithic chip, or we decided very strategically to build a modular approach, because it just gives us so much flexibility when we talk about the combination of CPU cores and I\/O. So, so far so good. I think there is some work to do to make sure that the latencies are appropriately taken care of, and the customers are working with us on that. I think the flexibility is really, really appreciated, particularly when you look at what we can do with single-socket servers as well. So we feel very good about where EPYC is positioned. I think the customer feedback continues to be very strong, and our goal is to get as many platforms out as possible with EPYC this year.","Hans Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question, and congratulations on the strong results. Lisa, notwithstanding the possibility that you guys beat your revised guidance you just gave today, if you just go by the revised guidance it's kind of implying calendar fourth quarter revenue down about 10% sequentially, which is about in line with seasonal. Just kind of curious just given where you are in the product cycle for Ryzen and EPYC, why a seasonal quarter wouldn't be something that you could beat. And I guess, equally important, are you planning to stay profitable in the calendar fourth quarter if it is down seasonal, just given the trajectory of OpEx?","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah. So yes, John. Let me answer that. When you look at our typical seasonality, as you said, we tend to be down in Q4. Now, semi-custom is still a large, large piece of our business, and semi-custom will peak in Q3 and it will come down in Q4. I also think that we want to be cognizant of the fact that some of the graphics demand that we see might be temporal. So we're not counting on that staying through the full year. We'll see what happens. Frankly, I think we'll see what happens with the whole mining stuff.","But I think when you look overall, I think that it shows that the business is strengthening. And so we like the growth very much. Ryzen will continue to grow through the second half. EPYC will continue to grow through the second half. Vega and our GPU business will continue to grow through the second half. And the only headwind that we have is sort of the game console business, just as part of normal seasonality. And then relative to the profit statement.","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","I think it's hard to predict that right now, John. I think if you look at our guidance, as we said, revenue mid to high teens, which from our standpoint is 16%, 17-ish increase, and we'll get to Q4 when we get there.","John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","That's helpful. And then, Lisa, for my follow-up, R&D ticking up, which is absolutely the right thing to do for the longer term health of the business, but I'm just kind of curious if you could help me understand your sort of R&D priorities. To what extent is this uptick in R&D really to help bolster your position in existing markets versus sort of R&D dollars to go after new markets, whether that be acceleration, machine learning, or autonomous driving? How should I think about that?","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah. So I think there are a couple points, John, that I want to make sure that we're clear about. Although OpEx is going up and R&D is going up, we're doing it in a very thoughtful fashion, and so staying within the confines of the business model is really important. And as Devinder said earlier, our model that we laid out at Financial Analyst Day for 2017 has us, let's call it at approximately 31% ER, and we're going to stay within that model for sure.","Now, relative to priorities in R&D, it is very much focused on sort of the new growth areas for us, very much focused on datacenter and very much focused on GPU compute, so around machine learning and sort of the entire compute space on the GPU side. It is fairly incremental in terms of adding things like customer support, field application engineering, software support, given that we're familiarizing people with our architecture. So I think it's good. We're happy that the business affords us the ability to increase R&D in this timeframe, and we're using it to accelerate our growth in these high-margin markets.","John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thanks, John. Operator, we have time for two more questions, please.","Operator","Certainly. Our next question is coming from Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.","Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Yeah. Hi. Thanks. First, Lisa, when you look at the EPYC, I know you said 20 customers already and then 20 more in the second half. Do you think that gets to 5% of your revenues, just the EPYC side of your revenues as you look at the third quarter? And should we assume pretty incrementally about, I don't know, not the 50% margins on your EPYC product, especially as it goes in the datacenter side?","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","So, Vijay, without getting too granular about percentage of EPYC revenue, I think what we've said is our target for EPYC, we sort of have -- the midterm target is to get back to double-digit market share, so over 10%. We think that we have a product and a customer set in an environment that does support that. It will take longer than this year to get there, so I think this is the multiple-quarter ramp for us, but in terms of how we've laid out the business model, I mean, that's all contemplated sort of in our overall growth model for 2017. As it relates to margins, again, without being very specific, I would say the EPYC margins are highly accretive, even at our current sort of pricing, which offers, I would say, significant value to the customer. I think it also gives us significant credit for the capability of the product. And so the margins are accretive to our business model.","Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Got it. Very helpful. Just on the Radeon Instinct side, too, can you give us some similar commentary on how you see in terms of customer adoption and what their response has been similar to EPYC?","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yes, yes. The Radeon Instinct, similarly, has a lot of interest from the marketplace. A number of different applications. We started shipping actually in July to some strategic datacenter customers. We see that interest continue to ramp. There I think it is \u2013 this is definitely a lumpy business, and so it goes \u2013 as a cloud guy puts on a new instance, you would see a larger buy. And that's the way it would work. But again, very good market. I think we're in the very early part of the growth trajectory for AMD in these markets. And we'll continue to invest and work closely with customers to ramp those platforms.","Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Thanks.","Laura Graves - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Thank you, Vijay.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Lisa, just want to follow up on your comments on the cryptocurrency market. Just curious, what's your visibility into whether someone \u2013 obviously, they buy a dedicated card. It'd be easier to track. Just your visibility on the back-end as to where the strength in the overall GPU market is coming from. You mentioned as the third factor I think in September, but then mentioned it may impact December. And if you can just talk about in that full-year guide, are you factoring in any contribution in December?","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","We're being conservative in our estimates for what will happen as we get in the fourth quarter. I think the visibility is it's not \u2013 it's anyone's guess at this moment. However, I think what we are doing very clearly is prioritizing sort of the core customer set so that we're segmenting the market. You can never segment it perfectly, but I think we are segmenting it well. And we continue to be very closely in tune with our partners and how this develops. And my expectation is that there will be a leveling off of the demand at some point. And as we fill the channels, that will become clear what the level-off point is. But right now, as we said, the channel inventories are very low. And so it's hard to call the absolute demand, and we're ensuring that we're not over-calling the demand.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. And then just a question for Devinder. The OpEx stepped up in September, it's hard to tell from the full-year guide, 31% can round a bunch of different ways. Just curious if you expect any follow through in that increase in R&D into the December quarter?","And then if you could just mention also timing of the JV payments? Obviously, you're not getting any in the back half of this year. Maybe you can talk about the milestones into next year and when those would come back as assets?","Devinder Kumar - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Yeah, let me take the JV one first. I mean, as we said in the commentary in my prepared remarks, $140 million licensing gained on the THATIC server JV today. We got $52 million this year, and there's nothing more this year. The remaining payments are based on some production-related milestones, and those are in 2018 and beyond. And we'll update that as we get closer.","As far as the OpEx is concerned, I think we've said a lot and we stand by what we said. We'll manage it in our guidance of expense to revenue ratio of approximately 31% for the year.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further closing comments.","Dr. Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much, Operator. We appreciate everyone being with us today. We look forward to spending more time with you in the coming quarter and thank you for your time.","Operator","Thank you.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Laura Graves. Please go ahead.","Laura Graves","Thank you, and welcome to AMD's first quarter 2019 conference call. By now, you should have had the opportunity to review a copy of our earnings release and slides. If you have not reviewed these documents, they can be found on the Investor Relations page of AMD's website, amd.com.","Participants on today's conference call are Dr. Lisa Su, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Devinder Kumar, our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer. This is a live call, and will be replayed via webcast on our website.","I would like to highlight some important dates for you. In celebration of AMD's 50th anniversary on May 1, 2019, Dr. Lisa Su and members of AMD's executive leadership team will host a panel discussion, reflecting on 50 years of innovation by AMD. This will be held at the NASDAQ market site in New York City.","Dr. Lisa Su, President and Chief Executive Officer, will also be delivering a keynote address at Computex in Taiwan on Monday, May 27; Ruth Cotter, Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, HR and Investor Relations will present at the Bank of America Global Technology Conference on Tuesday, June 4; and our 2019 second quarter quiet time will begin at the close of business on Friday, June 14, 2019.","Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of this current date and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We will refer primarily to non-GAAP financial measures during this call except for revenue and segment operational results, which are on a GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures referenced on this call are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in today's press release, which is posted on our website.","Please refer to the cautionary statements in our press release for more information. You will also find detailed discussions about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC and in particular, AMD's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018.","Now with that, I would like to have the call over to Lisa. Lisa?","Lisa Su","Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. We had a solid first quarter. Revenue was in line with our expectations at $1.27 billion, down 23% year-over-year. Ryzen and EPYC processor and data center GPU revenue more than doubled year-over-year helping expand gross margin by 5 percentage points, and partially offsetting graphics channel softness and lower semi-custom revenue.","Looking at our Computing and Graphics segment, revenue declined year-over-year as higher client processor sales were offset by lower graphics sales to the channel. Client processor sales increased by a strong double-digit percentage from the year-ago period, as unit shipments increased significantly and our new products drove a higher client ASP. As a result, we believe we gained unit market share for the sixth straight quarter.","In the desktop channel, demand for our highest-end Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 CPUs was strong, with sales increasing sequentially and outperforming seasonality.","Ryzen mobile processor adoption continues to accelerate. Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and other OEMs have launched more than a dozen new Ryzen mobile notebooks so far in 2019, helping us deliver our fifth straight quarter of year-over-year mobile processor growth. Our customers are on track to increase the number of Ryzen notebook models by more than 50% from 2018. The majority of these new systems are planned to launch in the second quarter in advance of the seasonally stronger second half of the year.","In Graphics, revenue decreased year-over-year driven largely by lower channel sales, partially offset by a significant increase in data center GPU sales. Radeon Vega GPU shipments grew by a strong double-digit percentage both year-over-year and sequentially based on increased adoption across OEM, gaming, and data center customers. Apple introduced two new iMac systems featuring upgraded Radeon Pro Vega GPUs that deliver up to 80% faster graphics performance than the previous generation.","We believe we made good progress improving channel inventory levels. Sell-through accelerated sequentially driven by sales of both our mainstream Radeon RX GPUs and new high-end Radeon VII gaming GPUs. We are well-positioned to grow GPU revenue in the second quarter and through the second half of the year as we expect to introduce our first 7-nanometer Navi gaming GPUs in the third quarter.","We delivered another quarter of strong data center GPU sales based on increased adoption across large customers. Our progress was highlighted by Google's announcement that they selected high-performance Radeon GPUs and AMD's software development tools to power their upcoming Stadia game streaming platform. Stadia is a great example of how we are extending the depth and breadth of our data center customer engagements. We are seeing growing customer interest in our differentiated platforms for game streaming, machine learning, and HPC workloads that combine our high-performance GPUs with open source software tools.","Turning to our Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-custom segment, revenue decreased from a year ago as expected due to lower Semi-custom revenue as we entered the seventh year of the current game console cycle. Our Semi-custom business model continues to play an important role in our long-term growth as our strong IP portfolio enables the industry's biggest brands to create differentiated solutions. The latest example is Sony. We are honored that Sony has selected a custom AMD SoC based on our Zen 2 CPU and Navi GPU architectures to power its next-generation PlayStation console.","Our server CPU revenue grew significantly from the year ago period, as EPYC processor adoption across cloud, HPC, and Enterprise customers continued to grow. Overall, in the data center, our CPU and GPU sales accounted for a mid-teens percentage of quarterly revenue. Our work with cloud leader, Amazon, continues to expand as they rolled out AMD-based offerings to additional regions and launched three new EPYC processor-powered EC2 instance families, including the first T3 Series Instance.","Growing HPC and regional cloud service provider deployments resulted in EPYC processor channel sales increasing sequentially. In the Enterprise, we added dozens of new customers across the aerospace, health care, automotive, and telecom industries based on the superior performance of EPYC processors in big data and general-purpose virtualized workloads.","Turning to our next-generation Rome processor, we made excellent progress in the quarter achieving key production milestones with our largest OEM and cloud customers. We're very excited about the performance of Rome, which is on track to deliver four times the floating point performance and double the compute performance per socket compared to our current generation EPYC processors. We are on track to begin Rome production shipments in the second quarter to support a third quarter launch.","In summary, I am pleased with our first quarter financial results based on the strong execution engine we have built across the company. Tomorrow is an important day in AMD's history as we celebrate our 50th anniversary. This is a significant milestone for any company, but especially significant for a technology company.","2019 is arguably the most important year in our history, as the $75 billion market for high-performance Computing and Graphics products has never been larger, and our product portfolio has never been stronger. We are right where we plan to be with our multiyear roadmap, including our upcoming 7-nanometer Ryzen, Radeon, and EPYC processors that can drive our next wave of revenue growth and share gains. We remain confident in our ability to continue delivering on our ambitious leadership roadmap for the PC, gaming, and datacenter markets.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our first quarter financial performance. Devinder?","Devinder Kumar","Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter of 2019 was a good start to the New Year. Revenue was $1.27 billion and gross margin of 41% was up almost 5 points from the prior year. This was the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin expansion, driven by the ramp of our strong portfolio of high-performance products.","Quarterly revenue was down 23% from a year ago. Strong sales of Ryzen and EPYC processors and datacenter GPUs were more than offset by lower graphics channel sales and lower semi-custom revenue.","Gross margin was 41%, up 470 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by Ryzen, EPYC \u2013 Ryzen and EPYC processor sales as well as datacenter GPU sales. Operating expenses grew 12% year-over-year to $498 million, primarily driven by go-to-market activities and investments in our product roadmap.","Operating income was $84 million, down from $152 million a year ago, primarily due to lower revenue and higher operating expenses, partially offset by a $60 million licensing gain from the joint venture with Thatic. Operating margin was 7%, down from 9% last year. Net income was $62 million, compared to $121 million a year ago, and diluted earnings per share was $0.06 per share compared to $0.11 per share a year ago.","Now turning to the business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $831 million, down 26% year-over-year, as strong client processor and datacenter GPU sales were more than offset by lower graphics channel sales. Ryzen products continued to ramp, driven by strong growth across both desktop and mobile processors.","In Graphics, sales were down year-over-year due to lower Graphics channel sales and negligible Blockchain related revenue in the quarter, partially offset by strong Radeon data center GPU sales. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $16 million compared to $138 million a year ago. The decrease was due primarily to lower revenue and higher OpEx.","In the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, revenue was $441 million, down 17% from the prior year. Server revenue growth was more than offset by anticipated lower semi-custom revenue. EESC segment operating profit was $68 million compared to $14 million a year ago. The improvement was largely due to an IP licensing gain of $60 million associated with the joint venture with THATIC.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable security totaled $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we received $448 million of cash related to Mubadala's warrant exercise. We used $64 million of cash to fully extinguish the 2019 term debt and $100 million of cash to retire other term debt.","The principal debt balance as of the end of the quarter was $1.4 billion as compared to $1.7 billion a year ago, and we have no long-term debt maturities until 2022. Free cash flow was negative $275 million in the quarter, primarily due to higher inventory and the timing of collections. We expect to be free cash flow positive for the full year.","Inventory was $955 million, up $110 million sequentially, primarily due to an increase in inventory of new products in anticipation of higher revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $130 million compared to $196 million a year ago, due to lower quarterly earnings and, on a trailing 12 month basis, adjusted EBITDA was $737 million. Gross leverage at the end of the quarter was 1.8 times.","Turning to the outlook for the second quarter of 2019. We expect revenue to be approximately $1.52 billion, plus or minus $50 million, an increase of approximately 19% sequentially and a decrease of approximately 13% year-over-year. Sequentially, the increase is expected to be driven by growth across all businesses. The year-over-year decrease is expected to be primarily driven by lower graphics channel space -- sales, negligible Blockchain related GPU revenue and lower semi-custom revenue.","In addition, for Q2 2019, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 41%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $510 million. As we invest in our new products and upcoming product launches, non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $25 million. For the full year 2019, AMD continues to expect high single-digit percentage revenue growth and non-GAAP gross margin to be greater than 41%.","In closing, the first quarter was a good start to the year. We remained focused on executing our plans for the remainder of the year, and look forward to unveiling a strong portfolio of next-generation products to drive financial growth and customer momentum throughout 2019.","With that, I'll turn it back to Laura for the question-and-answer session. Laura?","Laura Graves","Thank you, Devinder. Operator, we're ready for our first call?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Matt Ramsay from Cowan. Your line is now live.","Matt Ramsay","Good afternoon. Thank you very much. Congratulations, Lisa, to you and your team on the 50th anniversary. I guess, the first question from me is, it was encouraging to see you guys reiterate the full year growth expectation.","Obviously, one of your large server competitors had a bit of a hiccup on some of the outlook and talked about maybe a bit of a softer server market for the full year. Maybe you could give an update on what you guys are seeing for the server macro environment and the confidence that you might have in your product\u2019s ramping? Thank you.","Lisa Su","Sure, Matt. Thank you for the question. So, yes, as it relates to how the year is developing, it's developing largely as we expected when we started the year. So relative to our Q2 guidance, we are guiding up 19% sequentially and every business is growing.","That's coming from, if you look across the businesses, our client business is growing due to new platforms that are launching. Our graphics business, the channel inventory has improved since we started the year, and we have our Server business which is really starting some early shipments of Rome in the second quarter going into the second half of the year.","As it relates to the full year guidance and how we look at it, again, it's largely as we expected, as we're laying out the year. There certainly is some discussion with our customers about some inventory in the data center, especially here in the first half.","When we developed our plan, our data center business was always more second half weighted and continues to be so, because much of that is dependent on platforms that are launching around our Rome product portfolio.","So we're going to continue to watch the data center overall environment, but at this point, we're focused on our products. And our customers continue to have a very strong pull. There's a lot of interest in Rome. We're doing well on our qualifications, and so we feel good about how that's developing.","Matt Ramsay","Got it. Thank you. And as a follow-up, you mentioned the 19% sequential guidance for Q2. It seems like a bit of a transitional quarter for the company with a lot of things going on towards product launches that will happen to feed the back half of the year.","So maybe you could talk a little bit more granularly about the drivers of Q2 just given that it's a bit of a transition for a whole new portfolio rolling out? And if there's any kind of color on contributions from older or newer products in the second quarter guidance, that would be helpful. Thank you.","Lisa Su","Sure, Matt. So, yes, as we look at Q2, it is a bit of a transition in the product portfolio. It's an important quarter for us as we are preparing to launch our 7-nanometer products. In terms of the overall business, as I stated earlier, each of the business is growing for different reasons.","I think starting with server, again, it's the greatest percentage of growth, and And it really is the start of some shipments of Rome. We expect that Rome will launch here in the third quarter, and there are some preparations that need to be done for that.","As we look at the graphics business, again the channel inventory situation has improved, and so that we expect that the channel will be up here in the second quarter, and then into the second half as we launch Navi.","And in the client business, we have a large number of platforms with our OEM customers that are launching here in the second quarter around our second generation Ryzen mobile processors, and we're also in preparations for our third generation Ryzen desktop as well.","Laura Graves","Thank you, Matt. Operator, next question, please?","Operator","Sure. Your next question is coming from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.","Aaron Rakers","Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, first question, and I do have a quick follow-up is when you kind of layout Rome and the expectation of a ramp going forward, can you just remind us of how you currently see the set up with regard to market share opportunities or market share gains that you would expect? And where do you think you fell off this last quarter in terms of market share in the overall server space?","Lisa Su","Sure. Aaron thanks for the question. So look, as we look at the server market, we know very well that the data center market takes time to ramp with any new product. And so, that's the way we have sort of built our plans. What we have previously stated is that, from -- let's call it, at beginning of this year, we\u2019d expect that over the next quarter to six quarters, we would continue to ramp our server market share with a goal of getting to double-digit percentage share.","As it relates to the Q1 quarter, again, we'll have to wait to see how the numbers come out. The data center business for us, on the CPU side, behaved as expected in Q1, but But we did see some product mix shift. So Q4 was a large quarter for us in the cloud business for our EPYC processors and Q1, the mix shift did more to Enterprise channel. And from that, the ASPs were higher, the units were lower, and so again largely as we would've expected.","Aaron Rakers","Okay. And then as a quick follow-up, congratulations on the announcement of Sony. I'm just curious I think last quarter you\u2019d suggested that you expected that semi-custom business to decline by 20%-plus this year. Assuming that, that's still the case, number 1. Number 2, how do we now sort of think about the growth profile of that looking into next year? Thank you.","Lisa Su","Yes. So, yes, we are very pleased with our partnership and expanding our partnership with Sony on their next-generation consoles. As we see, the semi-custom business at this point, we still believe that it's going to be down substantially in 2019, let\u2019s call it approximately 20%-plus. And then as we go into 2020, without talking about any specific customer, we believe that semi-custom will return to a growth business for us in 2020 and beyond.","Aaron Rakers","Okay. Thank you.","Laura Graves","Thank you, Aaron.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.","Toshiya Hari","Hey, good afternoon. And thank you for taking the question. Lisa, we continue to hear about the CPU shortage, which is obviously primarily caused by your competitor. I'm curious, are you seeing any impact on your business in the near term? And more importantly, as we go into the second half and the ramp capacity, are you concerned at all that could disrupt your business, whether it\u2019d be market share swings or pricing pressure? And I have a follow-up.","Lisa Su","Sure. So, as it relates to CPU shortages in the market. Look, we see a little bit of that, I would say, there are pockets per footage, mostly at the low-end of the market, frankly. So, from our standpoint, I don't believe it's a huge contributor to our business.","As we look at the PC business, those in the first half and the second half of the year, we believe that the PC business can be a growth business for us. From a market environment standpoint, we believe the market is not too bad. We call it flat to slightly down. When we look at our product portfolio in the notebook space with our secondary Ryzen platforms, we believe we have much stronger platforms that we are ramping through this year.","And then in the desktop space, we believe will be very competitive as we've launched the third-generation of Ryzen desktops. So, I view the PC business is an important growth driver for us in 2019 and we see that it's a good market for us.","Toshiya Hari","Thank you. And then as a follow-up, you mentioned that data center CPUs and GPUs accounted for about mid-teens percentage of revenue in the quarter. Last quarter, can you give us a rough split between the two and related to that, I was hoping you can help besides the game streaming opportunity long-term.","Obviously, they're involved with Google today. How does that business went down the ball over the next 18 months? And what your opportunity elsewhere in terms of broadening your customer base? Thank you.","Lisa Su","Sure. So, as we stated, the data center CPU and GPU business was about mid-teens percentage of revenue. Of course, both businesses were down as expected in Q1 and much of that was the strength of the Q4 quarter, especially around the cloud.","We mentioned in Q4 that the split between CPUs and GPUs was close. They were close. As we look longer term for data center GPUs, and your question about the cloud streaming opportunity, we're very pleased with our partnership with Google. It's a result of several years of effort, where we were optimizing both hardware and software together.","And so we think it's an important vertical for us. We're working with other customers in the cloud streaming area as well. So, again, I think it's an interesting and important market over the next couple of years. We also have a number of other workload that we feel good about as it relates to data center GPU, including HPC, especially when you combine our CPU and GPU portfolio together, we think HPC is a great workload for us as well as machine learning.","And working with -- and machine learning, with a couple of leading cloud customers to, again, optimize our software to their needs. So, again, the data center GPU market will continue to be an important driver for us over the next couple of years.","Toshiya Hari","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is now live.","Stacy Rasgon","Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question on the gross margin guide; I'm a little confused why it's flat sequentially to Q2 on a pretty meaningful revenue lift? You talked about all business is growing, you mentioned a number of it, but you didn't mention semi-custom. Is this a matter of mix? A semi-custom driving a lot of the growth code, is there something going around about enter business mix or something quite? What's going on with the gross margins?","Lisa Su","Yes, Stacy, let me start and I'll Devinder comment. I should've mention semi-custom in that list as well. So, semi-custom is going through a seasonal build. So, although it will be down substantially year-over-year, it's still a seasonal build for us as we go from Q2 -- from Q1 into Q2. Devinder, maybe you want to comment as well?","Devinder Kumar","Yeah. So Stacy, rank order maybe like growth by business?","Lisa Su","Can I rank order the growth by business. That\u2019s probably a bit more granular than I'd like to get, but it's fair to say that all businesses have to grow a decent amount to get to 19% sequential growth.","Devinder Kumar","That's right, Lisa. So fundamentally, Stacy, it's the product mix in the quarter, that's driving the flat gross margin. And I'd add the 41% guide, it's just improve for the four points year-over-year. As you know very well we have businesses that are higher than corporate average, gross margin and lower than corporate average and the mix of the businesses, semi-custom that we just talked about lower than corporate average is driving the 41% guide for Q2.","Stacy Rasgon","Okay. ","Lisa Su","You would also -- I'm sorry, Stacy. I would just add. You would expect -- graphic is also a bit lower than corporate average on the consumer side.","Stacy Rasgon","Okay. So it's fair to say that a good amount of growth is coming from graphics and semi-custom as well as the other stuff?","Lisa Su","Yeah. It's with across all of the businesses.","Stacy Rasgon","Okay. Thank you. For my follow-up I had a question on OpEx. You're guiding 29% for the year and you're $510 million in Q2, and obviously, high single digits for the full revenue. So if I have revenue of 8% for the full year that would imply OpEx in Q3 and Q4 of $510 million flat to Q2 levels. Do you think that's realistic? Because OpEx actually stays flat during Q2 levels? Or there's a need to go higher, and if it goes higher does that imply that the revenue growth embedded in your guide for the year has to be above 8%?","Devinder Kumar","Yeah. I think, Stacy, the way you want to look at it is the first half of 2019, we do have incremental R&D and go-to-market activities in the first quarter and even in the second. As you know, we are preparing for a strong series of significant 7-nanometer product launches this year and also share gains as we get in the back half of the year. And that's obviously driving the OpEx.","Overall, for the year, we are comfortable in the 29% for the year of overall revenue from an OpEx standpoint. And as you have seen us in the past, we do have a way of modulating the OpEx that need it. But right now, we are investing in the roadmaps, we're investing product launches and the go-to-market activities and very focused to make sure that we are well-positioned in the first half going to the second half where we see the revenue lift compared to the first half of year 2019.","Stacy Rasgon","Does that apply OpEx -- you see OpEx coming up at the current levels for the rest of the year then? Or does it go down or stay flat?","Devinder Kumar","$510 million is the guide for Q2, and 29% for the year is the way I would say the model.","Stacy Rasgon","Got it. Thank you guys. Appreciate it.","Laura Graves","Thanks, Stacy. Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question is coming from David Wong from Nomura Instinet. Your line is now open.","David Wong","Thanks very much. Devinder, can you give us some idea of what gross margins are currently running at for the client the data center processors and what direction these gross margins are moving in?","Devinder Kumar","The client and data center businesses are higher than corporate average and the semi-custom business and graphics as we just said in the last quarter are lower than corporate average, especially graphics consumer side and the data center, GPU side obviously is better.","David Wong","Great. And our gross margins rising for your microprocessor businesses at the moment?","Devinder Kumar","I think earlier in the year this is the second quarter, we are getting the second quarter at 21% guide and our guidance for the year is greater than 41% on an annual basis, is what we have stated so far.","David Wong","Okay. Great. And Lisa, my last question. In 2020, do you expect meaningful semi-custom revenues outside the game console space? And if so, what type of applications will be semi-custom chips we used in?","Lisa Su","Yes, David, so as it relates the semi-custom business, as we go out in time, we do expect additional applications other than consoles, but consoles are a large piece of the business, and so you would expect that they would continue to be a large piece of the business.","David Wong","Great. Thanks.","Operator","And your next question today is coming from Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live.","Mitch Steves","Just one quick historic one and then I'll queue. But the first in the historical side for March 2018, did you guys provide a rough break out of how your revenue was server related?","Lisa Su","No. We wouldn't have done that.","Devinder Kumar","No, we haven't done that. Not that specific. I think server is, if you're referring to the CPU side, it's within the EESC segment.","Mitch Steves","Okay. And then if I look at the second half of the year, you guys tried to talk to for around 41%, 42% kind of gross margin rough level. So is it safe to assume that we should see a pretty big step function in September quarter on the gross margin? Or is that, I guess, is that incorrect, is that aggressive?","Devinder Kumar","I think you're looking at it from a viewpoint of the product mix. I'd say we are shipping, like Lisa said, run purpose for margin Q3. We have a couple of other new products that was not shipping in Q3, and we\u2019ll see how the margin comes out when we come in and talk about Q3 about 90 days from now.","Mitch Steves","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Joe Moore","Great. Thank you. I'm wondering if you can talk about gross margin in the consul segment, obviously, that's been pretty low historically. You also have customers funding for R&D but as you look to the next generation of consoles, do you see opportunity to improve the gross margin in that space?","Lisa Su","Yeah, Joe. I think it's a bit early to talk about margins for the next generation. As you stated, the gross margins of the console business are below corporate average. The operating margins are quite good because the customers are paying the engineering expenses for it. But I think the gross margins are below corporate average. We would expect though and I think you would expect us, as the company continues to grow, the percentage of the company that is semi-custom is lower than it has historically been.","Joe Moore","Yeah, that makes sense. And then if you look at the GPU data center opportunities, the gross margin there, how does that compare to, say, the discrete graphics portion of your business as a compressed the corporate average, things like that?","Lisa Su","The GPU data center business would be above corporate average and above our consumer graphics business.","Joe Moore","Great. Thank you.","Lisa Su","Thank you, Joe.","Laura Graves","Next question?","Operator","Certainly. Your next question is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Your line is now live.","Mark Lipacis","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have a couple questions on the server strategy longer term. Can you help us understand ultimately what percentage of the workloads in the cloud, do you expect to target? And -- that's the first part of the question.","The second part of the question is, I was hoping you could provide some color on the customization strategy? I think Intel may argue that they're embedding that blocks for the customers, is that something that you do or you think about doing? Or to what extent your customization strategy fall under your semi-custom model? And I was wondering if your customers on the server-side asking you for like an APU kind of a product wit a microprocessor and graphics processor capabilities integrated together? Thank you.","Lisa Su","Yeah, absolutely, Mark. So, look, when we think about our server strategy -- and maybe let me generalize it to where it's data center strategy overall. It is a multi-year multi-generational roadmap. In terms of the workloads that we plan to address, we are -- in addition to the workload that we do very, very well on, like, big data, data analytics and virtualization, high performance computing, cloud workloads. I think we do quite well with general-purpose workloads to as we move generations. So as we look at, for example, the Rome generation, second generation of EPYC, we would expect to address well 80%-plus of the workloads.","As it relates to customization for server CPUs, there are varying degrees of customization that customers want, especially as you go through a number of the different cloud workloads that are out there. There are specific requirements that are there. We're very comfortable doing that. I think the customers have been deeply engaged with us since the first generation of EPYC. There is both software customization as well as some hardware customization that we go through. And we feel very comfortable with our ability to address that across the cloud and the Enterprise businesses. And then, as we go forward, I think we are also very excited about what we can do when we put our CPU and GPU portfolio together and really do system-level optimization for the data center. So we view that as an early opportunity for us, but one where there is a lot of opportunity to help customers really optimize for very high-performance computing applications.","Mark Lipacis","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now live.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong results and the pipeline. Lisa two questions for me as well. First, you have Naples now and Rome server shipping soon, Intel has Cascade Lake with Optane. What are you hearing from customers on the pricing versus feature comparison? And what I'm going with that is, how well is AMD prepared if your competitor decides to perhaps become a little more aggressive on the pricing side? At what point does pricing matter, and at what point does your feature list matter more?","Lisa Su","Yes, so Vivek, look, we understand that it's a very competitive market out there. It's always been very competitive and we are prepared for it to get even more competitive. When you look at our roadmap, I think we feel very comfortable with sort of our positioning. And the way we think about it is when it comes to the data center market, you know, price is on the one factor and it\u2019s probably not the only most important factor when people are choosing their next-generation products. The most important factor is really the total cost of ownership, and the advantages that we have with our chiplet architecture and our 7-nanometer sort of process capabilities really have a great sort of power performance benefit.","So we are -- as you say, we're prepared for competitive environment, but we also feel that our products, from a performance standpoint and in a positioning standpoint will be positioned quite well in the marketplace.","Vivek Arya","Got it. And as a follow up, Lisa, you mentioned your goal of getting to double-digit market shares and servers over the next 4 to 6 quarters. I assume that will require greater contribution for Enterprise customers, and that is right. What push backs are you seeing from them now? Is it just a matter of time that you increased your Enterprise attraction? In general, what do you need to do anything extra to attract Enterprise customers? Thank you.","A \u2013 Lisa Su","No, it's a great point. We certainly have deep engagements with both cloud and the OEMs. On the Enterprise customers, we sell-through our OEM partners. The pushback that we get, I don't know if I would call it push back, I would just say that the Enterprise tends to move a bit more slowly than cloud. There are longer qualification cycles because their qualifications cycles on both the OEM side as well as the end customer side. We are continuing to build out our direct sales force as it relates to facing the Fortune 1000 customers and CIOs in that area.","And I believe, we will make progress in Enterprise, and certainly, as we go forward from the Naples generation into Rome, we'll have more platform covered with our OEMs, and I think there will be more familiarity with our architecture as well as more software optimized to our architecture. So yes, we're very committed to the Enterprise market and we expect that we will make progress with time.","Q \u2013 Vivek Arya","Thank you.","A \u2013 Laura Graves","Thank you, Vivek.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is now live.","Q \u2013 Blayne Curtis","Hey, thanks for taking my question. Lisa, just curious on the server product, you mentioned Enterprise was a bigger contributor in Q1. Just trying to think about the lifecycle of that big one, Enterprise takes longer to call, so just kind of curious where you are in terms of the rollout of that product that obviously Rome's going to come in at the end of the year. I'm just kind of curious, how you see the tail on EPYC 1 throughout the year?","A \u2013 Lisa Su","Yes, so Blayne, I think, as I've stated a little earlier, I think the data center business does tend to move slowly. So we would expect that there will be a good amount of time where we will have both Naples and Rome in market at the same point in time, and that just depends on qualification cycles, platform needs and some platforms are being refreshed right away, some platforms are going to take a little bit longer to be refreshed. And so, from my standpoint, I think that Naples will continue to be important for us in 2019, even as we ramp Rome with our launch in the second half of the year.","Q \u2013 Blayne Curtis","Got it. And if I could just ask on the data center GPU product you had, the Google ramp, I think it started in Q4. Just kind of curious, your pipeline for that product and how you think about the slope of that business and the lumpiness given that large customer?","A \u2013 Lisa Su","Yes, so we do expect the data center GPU business to be a bit lumpy. We do have several sort of large customers that are ramping product with us, and there will be some ebb and flow as we go on a quarterly basis. But on an annual basis, I think 2019 will certainly be -- we expected it to be significantly up from 2018. And the pipeline is good. So when we look at the pipeline, as I mentioned, cloud streaming is a good workload for us. Google is one customer, but we're working with other customers as well, and we also see HPC and machine learning as additional workloads that will be good for us in that business.","Q \u2013 Blayne Curtis","Got you, thanks.","A \u2013 Laura Graves","Operator, we have time for two more questions, please?","Operator","Certainly. Our question is coming from Hans Mosesmann from Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is now live.","Q \u2013 Hans Mosesmann","Hey thanks. Lisa, regarding Navi, if you comment on it what is the positioning of that particular product relative to the -- your current 7-nanometer GPU? And regarding Navi, can you tell us if it's going to include rate tracing?","A \u2013 Lisa Su","Yeah, so, Hans, we are excited about Navi. Navi is a new architecture for us in gaming. It has a lot of new features, across the Navi architecture. Things are progressing well. We expect it to launch in the third quarter.","From a positioning standpoint, I probably won't go through it in great detail right now other than to say that it is 7-nanometer, Navi, but it will be positioned below where, for example, our Radeon VII's is position today from a price point standpoint.","And then, in terms of Ray tracing, again, we will talk more about our overall Navi roadmap as we get closer to the launch.","Q \u2013 Hans Mosesmann","Okay great. Thank you.","A \u2013 Lisa Su","Thank you.","Operator","Our final question today is coming from Kevin Cassidy from Stifel. Your line is now live.","Q \u2013 Kevin Cassidy","Thanks for taking my question. And congratulations and as you're introducing the new generations of Ryzen, should we assume that ASPs will continue to go up or are some of this purpose built for lower price points?","A \u2013 Lisa Su","Yes, Kevin. So, as we look at the new generations of Ryzen, our goal is certainly to improve the mix of the products. And so we think, as we improve the performance of the product that we can improve that mix.","Now, the actual mix will vary of course depending on a number of things as we go through quarter-by-quarter. But certainly, as our goal is to continue to improve our penetration at the higher end of the PC processors.","Q \u2013 Kevin Cassidy","Okay great. Thank you.","A \u2013 Devinder Kumar","Thank you.","Laura Graves","Thank you, Kevin. Thank everyone for joining us today. This concludes our call. We appreciate your time, and attention to this earnings call, and certainly your support of our company. Have a nice evening.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference.

You may also find detailed discussion about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC and in particular, AMD\u2019s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 29, 2013.","Now with that, I would like to hand the call over to Rory. Rory?","Rory Read","Thank you, Ruth. Third quarter revenue of $1.46 billion increased 26% sequentially and 15% year-over-year as we returned to profitability and delivered positive free cash flow. Revenue was higher than guided based on incremental demand for our new semi-custom SOCs. The three step turnaround plan we outlined a year ago to restructure, accelerate and ultimately transform AMD is clearly paying off. We completed the restructuring phase of our plan, maintaining cash at optimal levels and beating our $450 million quarterly operating expense goal in the third quarter. We are now in the second phase of our strategy \u2013 accelerating our performance by consistently executing our product roadmap while growing our new businesses to drive a return to profitability and positive free cash flow. ","We are also laying the foundation for the third phase of our strategy, as we transform AMD to compete across a set of high growth markets. Our progress on this front was evident in the third quarter as we generated more than 30% of our revenue from our semi-custom and embedded businesses. Over the next two years we will continue to transform AMD to expand beyond a slowing, transitioning PC industry, as we create a more diverse company and look to generate approximately 50% of our revenue from these new high growth markets. ","We have strategically targeted that semi-custom, ultra-low power client, embedded, dense server and the professional graphics market where we can offer differentiated products that leverage our APU and graphics IP. Our strategy allows us to continue to invest in the product that will drive growth, while effectively managing operating expenses. This has been exemplified by the 10% sequential reduction in our expense to revenue ratio, as we drive to best-in-class performance on this key metric.","Several of our growth businesses passed key milestones in the third quarter. Most significantly, our semi-custom business ramped in the quarter. We successfully shipped millions of units to support Sony and Microsoft, as they prepared to launch their next-generation game consoles. Our game console wins are generating a lot of customer interest, as we demonstrate our ability to design and reliably ramp production on two of the most complex SOCs ever built for high-volume consumer devices. We have several strong semi-custom design opportunities moving through the pipeline as customers look to tap into AMD\u2019s IP, design and integration expertise to create differentiated winning solutions. ","We made good progress in our embedded business in the third quarter. We expanded our current embedded SOC offering and detailed our plans to be the only company to offer both 64-bit x86 and ARM solutions beginning in 2014. We have developed a strong embedded design pipeline which, we expect, will drive further growth for this business across 2014. ","We also continue to make steady progress in another of our growth businesses in the third quarter, as we delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of revenue and share growth in the professional graphics area. We believe we can continue to gain share in this lucrative part of the GPU market, based on our product portfolio, design wins [in place] [ph] and enhanced channel programs. ","In the server market, the industry is at the initial stages of a multiyear transition that will fundamentally change the competitive dynamic. Cloud providers are placing a growing importance on how they get better performance from their datacenters while also reducing the physical footprint and power consumption of their server solution.","This will become the defining metric of this industry and will be a key growth driver for the market and the new AMD. AMD is leading this emerging trend in the server market and we are committed to defining a leadership position.","Earlier this quarter, we had a significant public endorsement of our dense server strategy as Verizon announced a high performance public cloud that uses our SeaMicro technology and Opteron processor. We remain on track to introduce new, low-power X86 and 64-bit ARM processors next year and we believe we will offer the industry leading ARM-based servers.","Now, looking at our traditional businesses. In the third quarter, our graphics business was in transition as our AIB [add-in-board] partners prepare to launch new products based on our new R7 and R9 graphics chips.","The transition is now complete and we\u2019re seeing strong demand for our new products which we believe will -- can drive consistent growth in the coming quarters. A key innovation in these new chips is Mantle. Mantle was developed in conjunction with game developers to allow them to take better advantage of the capability of AMD\u2019s latest graphics cores resulting in dramatically better performance and power efficiency.","Mantle also means the investments developers make to create great content for the Sony and Microsoft consoles translates into optimized experience for all AMD APUs and GPUs moving forward.","Turning to the PC business, the 300 million plus unit market remains an important part of our business but the market is clearly in transition. As evidenced in the third quarter by consumer, notebook softness, which we expect to continue for the next several quarter as tablet adoption increases and our customer\u2019s inventory levels remain lean.","We expect PC industry unit shipments will decline approximately 10% this year and by a similar amount in 2014. We have the right product in IT and will continue to compete effectively in this market.","We are well positioned to expand our channel business and strategic OEM partnerships around consumer notebook and commercial product. Kabini continues to ramp and support of a number of high volume OEM platforms and Temash adoption is growing.","Toshiba and HP announced the first Temash powered convertibles and we expect more designs from other OEMs to launch this quarter. Our work to strengthen our desktop business is gaining momentum.","We delivered the second straight quarter of channel revenue growth based on strong demand for our high-end A8 and A10 APUs and FX CPUs. We expect this trend to continue.","We remain on track to begin shipping our next generation Kaveri APU for the channel this quarter. And key motherboard partners are already offering new product in anticipation of this launch.","So in summary, we are successfully hitting key milestones of our three-step strategy to diversifying and transform our business. We have completed the first step, restructuring AMD and stabilizing our business.","We effectively managed cash at the optimal level and beat our $450 million quarterly operating expense goal in the third quarter. We are now in the second phase, accelerating our performance by consistently executing our product road map and growing our new businesses.","Our success here drove 26% sequential revenue growth and returned AMD to profitability and generated free cash flow in the third quarter. Our progress sets us up to ultimately transform AMD in the third and final step, as we leverage our IP and design expertise from our traditional businesses to generate approximately 50% of our future revenues from high-growth markets over the next two years. We are in the middle of a multi-year journey we outlined over a year ago to redefine AMD as a leader across the more diverse set of growth markets. ","I like to take this opportunity to thank AMD-ers across the world who have poled together to deliver on our commitment and successfully execute our plan. The job is not done but we are making good and real progress. I look forward to the next step of our strategic transformation. ","Now I\u2019d like to hand the call over to Devinder. Devinder?","Devinder Kumar","Thank you, Lorry. Our third quarter results met or exceeded our guidance for revenue, gross margin, operating expenses and cash, although inventory was higher than guided. We completed the first phase of our three-step plan to transform AMD -- the reset and restructure phase, and we are performing well in the second phase, accelerating our business and executing on our 2013 product roadmap.","In the third quarter, we made progress towards our goal of diversifying our product portfolio, as we successfully ramped our semi-custom products. Specifically, our semi-custom and embedded revenue accounted for more than 30% of total company revenue, exceeding the target of 20% of revenue by the fourth quarter of 2013. ","Finally, we returned to profitability, both in operating and income, met our target of reducing operating expenses to $450 million and generated positive free cash flow ahead of plan. Significant change is underway at AMD, as we continue our transformation into 2014 and beyond.","Now let me turn to the specifics of the quarter. Revenue for the third quarter of 2013 was $1.46 billion, an increase of 26% from the second quarter and an increase of 15% year-over-year. This represents the highest sequential revenue growth in the past five years. The increase was driven by more than doubling of our graphics and visual solutions segment revenue quarter-on-quarter, primarily from the ramp of our semi-custom SOCs. ","Gross margin was 36%, down 4 percentage points sequentially and in line with our expectations, as we grew our semi-custom business, which has lower than corporate average margins but significant revenue and earnings power as volumes ramp. You will recall that the semicustom NRE operating model drives significantly lower operating expenses for this business, with the majority of its gross margin dollars falling through to operating income. The third quarter result includes a $19 million benefit, or approximately 1 percentage point from the sale of inventory previously reserved in the third quarter of 2012, as compared to an $11 million benefit, or approximately 1 percentage point in the second quarter of 2013. ","Non-GAAP operating expenses were $443 million, slightly below our targeted level of $450 million, primarily due to the timing of certain marketing-related expenses. Non-GAAP operating income was $78 million and non-GAAP net income was $31 million, both of which exclude a gain of $22 million from the real-estate transactions in the quarter. Non-GAAP earnings-per-share were $0.04, calculated using 764 million diluted shares. Adjusted EBITDA was $153 million, an increase of $99 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to improved operating income. ","Now turning to the business segments. Computing Solutions segment revenue was $790 million, down 6% sequentially, due to lower notebook and chipset unit shipments, partially offset by higher desktop unit shipments. Computing Solutions operating income was $22 million, up from $2 million in the second quarter despite the sequential 6% decline in revenue, driven by lower operating expenses.","Graphics and Visual Solutions segment revenue was $671 million, more than double last quarter\u2019s level, driven by shipment of game console, semi-custom SoCs. Graphics and Visual Solutions segment operating income was $79 million, compared to breakeven in the prior quarter, primarily due to the semi-custom business.","Operating margin for the semi-custom business was in the mid teens, primarily due to higher revenue and a very smooth [trend] [ph] in our first full quarter of production. Moving forward, we expect semi-custom operating margin performance to continue to improve as the business gains traction, volumes increase and cost improve.","Turning to the balance sheet, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance including long-term marketable securities was $1.2 billion. Third quarter real estate transactions generated cash proceeds of $56 million. We remain committed to operating and funding the business appropriately and continue to have a number of liquidity bolstering opportunities available.","Inventory, as I stated earlier, was higher than guided at $922 million, largely driven by next-generation game console product ramps and preparation for fourth quarter shipments of our new Graphics products. That, as of the end of the quarter was $2 billion, flat from the prior quarter.","Accounts payable at the end of the quarter was $574 million, up $172 million from the second quarter due to the timing of purchases and payments.","Depreciation and amortization was $52 million, down $2 million sequentially. And lastly, we generated positive free cash flow of $6 million in the quarter.","Now turning to the outlook. For the fourth quarter of 2013, AMD expects revenue to increase 5% sequentially, plus or minus 3%. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 35%, as our semi-custom business continues to represent a greater portion of our overall revenue. We expect to continue to maintain quarterly non-GAAP operating expenses in the $450 million range and expect to be profitable at the net income level.","Inventory is expected to be flat from third quarter levels and cash is expected to be approximately $1.2 billion. Capital expenditures for the full year 2013 are expected to be approximately $110 million, down from our prior guidance of $150 million.","In summary, our execution and product diversification strategy is showing results as evidenced by our return to profitability in the third quarter of 2013. We are pleased to have delivered on our financial commitment so far this year, some ahead of schedule and expect to continue these positive trends in the fourth quarter.","With that, I'll turn it back to Ruth? Ruth?","Ruth Cotter","Thank you, Devinder. And Operator, we\u2019d be happy for you to pull the audience please for some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Sure. Thanks. (Operator Instructions) Our first question in queue will come from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","David Wong - Wells Fargo","Thanks very much. I think in your CFO commentary you pointed out that Graphics would decline because of the transition to the new product. Now that and you also said that the new products have transitions. So do we expect a jump in Graphics revenue in the fourth quarter and also what does your guidance assume in terms of microprocessor revenue sequential growth? Is it up or down in the fourth quarter?","Lisa Su","Hi, David. This is Lisa. Let me take the Graphics question. So, first, we\u2019ve talked about Graphics as a multi-quarter growth strategy for us in terms of market share and we are certainly seeing that we are executing on that path.","When we look at the third quarter relative to the fourth quarter and where we are going we have built a very strong product portfolio. We just announced our full lineup for the R7 and R9 Series and those were launched in September and shipping in October. So we did see a little bit of a transition at the end of the third quarter, but we do expect to gain share in the fourth quarter with our graphics business.","Rory Read","And from a CPU standpoint, David, I think you will see that the market continues to be in transition. There is no doubt for 2013 we see the market down 10%, we see that continuing into 2014. As we manage our portfolio into fourth quarter, we want to keep a long view to the quarter. We know 1Q and 2Q are going to be seasonality light; that\u2019s just how it is. And we want to make sure we\u2019re managing inventory and positioning properly. So I would expect we will continue to see the market feel pressure, down year to year and I would expect that we will manage this and not lean into it to make sure we have a more consistent revenue path as we go into 2014.","David Wong - Wells Fargo","One final one, I think you noted your semi-custom business operating margin was in the mid-teens, so that was quite a bit better than you\u2019d expected initially. Can you improve it from here, or is this the right operating margin for us to think of for the current consoles semi-custom business?","Devinder Kumar","I think David, you are right. I mean the operating margin, when we discussed this last quarter, I had said low double digits, it came in at the mid-teens, and really that\u2019s credit to the higher revenue that we had in the quarter and the successful execution of a very steep ramp in the product in the fiscal quarter production. And as you know, as we gain traction and get more volume and cost improvement, the operating margin could improve from the mid-teen level. ","Rory Read","I think it\u2019s also important to see the kind of execution that we delivered in semi-custom in this ramp. This is one of the most complex ramp that we have seen with these set of SOCs. And what\u2019s really encouraging is how our customers are looking at this in terms of the innovation that we've created here, as well as our execution. And that\u2019s driving some serious interest in terms of our pipeline and opportunities in the semicustom space that are moving through at this time.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.","Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James ","Thank you, and congrats on the execution on the semi-custom. Hey guys, can you provide a roadmap for some granularity regarding process node transitions in 2014 and \u201915 as it relates to FinFETs by graphics and APU?","Lisa Su","Hi Hans, thanks for your question. And relative to where we are in terms of process technology node transitions, we are typically at the leading edge across the technology nodes. We are fully top to bottom in 28 nanometer now across all of our products, and we are transitioning to both 20 nanometer and to FinFETs over the next couple of quarters in terms of designs. So we will continue to do that across our foundry partners. ","Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James ","Specifically to FinFETs, if you don\u2019t mind?","Lisa Su","We will do 20 nanometer first, Hans and then we will go to FinFETs. ","Operator","And it looks like our next question in queue will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Rory, maybe one more on the PC business, now that Intel is starting to become more aggressive in the lower priced segment of the market, also in the tablet category with Bay Trail. And these are segments where you have traditionally held a larger market share on a relative basis. So if you are expecting the PC market to decline 10% next year and Intel continues to be aggressive in that lower priced segment of the market, how do you think your PC sales will trend next year? Just conceptually, I understand it\u2019s too early to make a specific prediction.","Rory Read","From my perspective, Vivek, I think that we\u2019ve created a very interesting product set, with the current products and the feedback I'm getting from our customers in terms of the design wins and the ramp. They look solid. Our volume is solid in that space. And the next-generation products, the silicon\u2019s already in shops. So that\u2019s positioning us well to continue to compete in the segment. But make no mistake about it. The PC industry is clearly in transition and will continue to be in transition, as tablet continues to attack particularly in the consumer segment. We think we can compete well and it will make a significant portion to our business moving forward.","But think about it. Two years ago we were 90% to 95% of our business centered over PCs and we\u2019ve launched the clear strategy to diversify our portfolio taking our IT -- leadership IT and Graphics and CPU and taking it into adjacent segment where there is high growth for three, five, seven years and stickier opportunities.","We see that as an opportunity to drive 50% or more of our business over that time horizon. And if you look at the results in the third quarter, we are already seeing the benefits of that opportunity with over 30% of our revenue now coming from semi-custom and our embedded businesses.","We see it is an important business in PC, but its time is changing and the go-go era is over. We need to move and attack the new opportunities where the market is going, and that\u2019s what we are doing.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And maybe one for, Devinder, on the cash side, I think, Devinder in the prepared comments you said that you expect to be at $1.2 billion at the end of Q4. So slightly up sequentially and then you do expect to be at the $1.1 billion optimal level by Q1. But given the $200 million payment due in Q1, does it mean you expect to generate cash also in Q1 which is seasonally a weaker quarter? Thank you.","Devinder Kumar","Yeah. Vivek, if you look at the last one year, I think that was exactly what we said about a year ago about maintaining cash at $1.1 billion level well above the [back at] [ph] minimum. And as you have seen, despite a very challenging year that we have gone through, we have successfully maintained $1.1 billion of cash, without by the way getting any external financing.","And with the ramp in the business that we see here at the level that we came in in Q3 and what we are projecting for Q4 and with any levers available to us if wanted, I am very confident we can maintain cash at these levels.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Rory, I guess, what I am trying to understand little bit better is, where do you believe the trajectory of the gaming ramp kind of flattens out, so you\u2019ve got some benefit here in September and December quarter with initial deals. As we look into the first half of next year, what\u2019s the right steady state run rate and I guess, specifically, now that you have kind of broken through the breakeven mark on the P&L, do you think you can stay above breakeven in what\u2019s usually a seasonally soft quarter in calendar first quarter?","Rory Read","Yeah. So we won\u2019t be giving guidance on first quarter at this point. But clearly it\u2019s our objective to get back and black in third quarter and continue to deliver that in fourth quarter and this year is the tale of two halves, the first half and improving second half.","As we look to \u201914 we need to look at the full year and drive a business that drives revenues growth and profitability for the full year that needs to be the next step in our transformation.","Now in terms of the question about gaming, gaming is going to be an important driver of the business and if you think about consoles traditionally, that\u2019s a five plus year business and it generally peaks in the third year. It will have some seasonality in the first half of the year but we think there are strong demand and opportunity for us to continue to have very good business. And we\u2019ll share the specifics of that as we give the guidance for 1Q next quarter.","But I think it is important to think about it as we continue to go after this pipeline in semi-custom, we will look to close additional deals over the next two years, one year and two-year, that will allow us to continue to fill out that business with this nice sticky flow of revenue both in embedded and semi-custom.","And while we are in the early phases of this transformation, as you move out and take the long view, you will see the portfolio drive a much more consistent level of revenue moving forward.","But, again, it\u2019s our objective, as we stated before to get back in black, which we did in third quarter and then to move forward in fourth quarter to continue to accelerate. And then for \u201914 is to drive a business that\u2019s profitable for the full year and drives revenue growth for the full year.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Thanks Rory. And then my follow-up for Devinder, given inventory target for the December quarter and can you guess bring this up to speed on where we stand with the wafer side of supply agreement with GlobalFoundries for this year relative to your obligation that you had in Q3, Q4?","Devinder Kumar","Yeah. As I said in my prepared remarks, I expect inventory levels to remain essentially flat from where we ended Q3. I recall that it\u2019s a steep ramp in the business, we introduced of the semicustom products, the new product that Lisa referenced earlier R7, R9 series. So I expect that in the Q4 timeframe, [indiscernible] Talking about the WSA from Globalfoundries. We are on track to meet the commitment for the 2013 WSA and on the 2014, if that\u2019s what you are referring, we are in discussions to figure out the pricing and wafer of volumes for 2014 and I expect those to close within the 30 or 60 days.","Operator","Our next questioner in queue will come from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. ","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank","Hi thanks for letting me a question. One clarification from the prior question. Do you expect seasonality in the gaming console business in the first half of \u201914, or is the early stage of which we are in the ramp and the geographic decision expanding for those launches, something that could offset that seasonality?","Lisa Su","Hi Ross, this is Lisa. Let me answer that question. So again, we do \u2013 the game console business is consumer business. So we do expect some level of seasonality. You are absolutely right. It\u2019s the first year of launch and there is a pent-up demand. So we will see some seasonality as we go into the first half of the year but probably a little bit different than normal years.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank","And one other clarification for Devinder, on the gross margin guidance of 35%, what does that assume as far as sales of previously reserved inventory, are you going to get that one point again?","Devinder Kumar","Actually that\u2019s not included. I think as we have said earlier we remain opportunistic and if the opportunity comes along, we go ahead and sell the parts [ph]. But there are no plans to go ahead and do that at this point. We have about $40 million left of the previously reserved inventory which we took in Q3 of 2012 to the tune of $100 billion.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank","I guess the final question, more of a structural one, as we look forward into next year. You did a great job of getting down even under the $450 million in OpEx that you have talked about. If we think about next year conceptually, how should we expect the company\u2019s OpEx to change alongside of revenue? Do you think $450 million is something you can hold throughout the year, or what are the puts and takes from a kind of bigger picture perspective?","Devinder Kumar","I think the key I would leave you with is, we have been very disciplined from an OpEx management standpoint. We actually beat the target of $450 million that we set, and projecting to be around $450 million for Q4. I think you are going to see about AMD with the mix in the business and the changing model, as we vary focus on operating margin. So obviously if revenue goes up significantly, there is a possibility that OpEx might go up. But I think you are going to see us as being very disciplined from a viewpoint of how OpEx modulates against the revenue increase or decline.","Rory Read","And Ross, I want to add a little something here to get a perspective on how we see this business evolving over time. Look at the semi-custom business and how we are reusing IP in a series of high-growth segments. And semicustom is an NRE model where there is an investment around engineering. In the quarter we drove $300 million of additional revenue, up 26% and at the same time we had expense declined almost 10%, following the year we\u2019ve driven down 25%. ","Clearly, that says we\u2019re getting a strong leverage in that model and as we consider that in some of our core businesses, they will continue to see pressure, they are at a different point and their maturity will drive for higher efficiencies in those segments. And at the same time look for opportunities to make investments to capture the new growth segments, like growth businesses, like pro-graphics, embedded and semi-custom. But overall I think it\u2019s fair to say we will look for more efficiencies as we move forward but it will be balanced.","Operator","Our next questioner on the phone queue will come from Romit Shah with Nomura.","Romit Shah - Nomura","And the competing results are my biggest concern looking at the quarter, and Rory, you talked [ph] to the weakness to just general softness in consumer notebooks. But if I look at your numbers, the computing business was down 6% sequentially, so desktops were up, which means notebooks are probably down more than 10% and I compare that to Intel whose PC business was up, I think mid single digits and are you seeing Gartner were also up. So how do we reconcile the difference between AMD\u2019s consumer business, notebook business and Intel and just the general market?","Rory Read","I think you kind of summed it up properly. The consumer market is feeling more pressure, but all parts of the PC markets are down. This market, this industry is down 10% and at rates it\u2019s never experienced before. It\u2019s going to continue.","From our perspective, AMD is over index the client notebook. We have always been. We have had, just like we have to diversify our portfolio across high-growth segment, we need to diversify this core business. We need to move stronger into desktop and as we talked about a year ago, we worked on the inventory on the desktop segment and we built and repaired that and we have seen two quarters of consistent revenue growth in that segment and we believe that we have the right product stack to continue to make progress and that\u2019s part of our business as well.","But there is no doubt that the PC client segment particularly at the entry level will feel pressure from tablet and it\u2019s a competitive space. We are going to be in there and we are going to compete because we have very good product. But that is a key driver why we are moving in the direction of this transformation, this multi-year strategic transformation. We will invest in those growth markets and we will attack the phase businesses around efficiency and where we can diversify the portfolio and gain revenue.","Devinder Kumar","And I would add from a financial standpoint just to levels that with what we saw coming and what reset and restructure and acceleration and transformation is all about. If you look at that particular segment from a revenue standpoint year-over-year, revenue is down about $140 million, proximity is up about $36 million.","Quarter-on-quarter, revenue is down about $51 million and the proximity went from essentially breakeven to what we ended up in Q3 at $22 million and that is essentially the power of the expense model, how we are deploying the resources from a transformation standpoint into what we call the growth businesses, including the semi-custom and the PC business which obviously is under pressure.","Romit Shah - Nomura","All right. That\u2019s helpful. And the, sorry, if I missed this, but in Q4 embedded in the 5% sequential growth, are you assuming that computing is stable or growing?","Rory Read","I think from a computing standpoint, I think there is no doubt that that market will continue to see pressure. I think at the industry level, as well as in the consumer segment. We are planning not to lean into that but to manage the inventory, yes, we much more like to see a consistent revenue through that weak part of 2014 where seasonality effects it.","So we don\u2019t want to kind of get a bumpy mood there. I think we will see it continue to trend slightly down. But I think as we move into 1Q and 2Q we can continue to build off that base as we add the new revenues as part of our strategy.","Romit Shah - Nomura","All right. Thanks Rory.","Rory Read","You are welcome.","Operator","Thank you, sir. And now our next question in queue will come from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley","Great. Thank you. I want to go back to the wafer supply agreement question with GlobalFoundries. It looks like you were -- you used up 46% of that as of the 2Q -- 10-Q. The Computing Solutions business looks like will be down in the second half, next year move some of that business to SMC. So, I guess, there is some further clarity on why you are confident that you will use the entire amount of that?","Devinder Kumar","The total amount that we committed to purchase in Q -- in 2013 is $1.15 billion and looking at the numbers that I am looking at we are on track to satisfy the obligation for the WSA for 2013.","Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Great. Thanks. And then the inventory building, why do you need to maintain inventory at this level if your revenues are going only about looks like about $75 million in the fourth quarter?","Devinder Kumar","Well, it is the timing right. So you go ahead and have the build in an inventory from a viewpoint of the steep ramp in revenue and you can have the timings from a viewpoint of when the wafers come in and then we have the pods. And what we are doing from the management standpoint is over Q3 and Q4, keeping the inventory flat while the revenue has gone up 26% from Q2 to Q3 and projected to go up again in Q4.","So I think you need to take the longer view in terms of the six-month period, how much of revenue has gone up from the first half to the second half and inventory essentially has gone from $600 million to $900 million. And by the way the revenue is up significantly in both quarters compared to the prior quarters.","Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question in queue comes from the line of Chris Rolland with FBR. ","Christopher Rolland - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co","Back to the op margin, the incremental op margin in graphics, probably implying mid-teens, maybe a little bit better on the gaming console business. As we think about that going forward, once this product is really on cruise control, even if you had seen couple years from now, what sort of incremental improvements are we talking about when there is really not that much SG&A to support this -- R&D to support this. I mean, are we talking maybe another 500 or even 1000 basis points in op margin improvements at its peak?","Devinder Kumar","Without giving the guidance, let me comment. Overall as you can see when you have a ramp in revenue for a new business like semicustom, that sort of amount of money you spend from an OpEx standpoint. The semicustom business, in particular the game console business is built on an NRE model. The R&D cost had been incurred upfront. The gross margins as we have been very transparent, lower than the corporate average but the majority of that was the operating margin line. In Q3 alone thinking that we were the low double digits when we talked about last quarter, we came in at the mid-teens. ","As we gain traction, as we extract more efficiencies, as we go ahead and increase the volume and get cost improvements, the operating margin could go up from the mid-teens higher than where we came in, in Q3. I\u2019ll let Lisa comment from a business standpoint too.","Lisa Su ","Yes, Chris, just to give you a little bit more color on that. So the operating margin did come in a little bit better than we originally planned and that was primarily because the ramp was actually quite smooth and it went very well. As we look forward, again, this is a very nice product. It's one of those -- each of these products are high-volume, they give us a lot of opportunity to optimize, yield and cost and other things. So we are going to be working hard to improve that operating margin over the next number of quarters and it\u2019s something that we believe there is leverage in.","Rory Read","And Chris, one of the things you\u2019ve really got to think about in this business, these are just the first two wins in the semicustom space. We have a pipeline of additional products and it\u2019s our intention to win and mix in a whole set semicustom offerings as we build out this exciting and important new business. And also as you think about that in a remodel, look at the expense to revenue ratio. When we historically ran this business at different margin, it was much higher, the high 30s, even into the 40s. In this quarter we saw a 10% reduction in in the unit R, with that significant revenue gains. And we are going to drive that efficiencies moving forward. Think about building that business, and how the power of this model continues to grow over time.","Operator","Our next phone next question will come from the line of Srini Pajjuri with CLSA Securities. ","Srini Pajjuri - CLSA Securities","Maybe for Lisa. Lisa, I mean given that the product\u2019s life in game console is quite long. I am trying to understand your our own product refreshes work. For example, you're starting at 28 and will this product stay at 28 forever, or are you going to switch to 28 at some point and when that happens -- what happens, obviously the costs are going to increase, and I am just wondering what happens to the margin side of the equation?","Lisa Su ","Srini, good questions. So it is a long life cycle product over five to seven years. Certainly when we look at cost reduction opportunities, one of the important ones is to move technology nodes. So we will in this timeframe certainly move from 28 nanometer to 20 nanometer and now the reason to do that is both for pure die cost savings as well as all the power savings that our customer benefits from. So I think we will see leverage in the model as we continue to improve the cost and as cost improves the volume loss will also go up.","Srini Pajjuri - CLSA Securities","So you actually expect the cost to go down as we move to 20, but not to go up?","Lisa Su ","Absolutely, on a unit basis, yes.","Srini Pajjuri - CLSA Securities","And then just a couple of clarifications. I think there was a mention about SeaMicro winning some designs. Just wondering if you could give us an update on that, it\u2019s been a while since you acquired that and how that\u2019s tracking and if you could quantify that, I think that will be great.","Lisa Su ","Yes, absolutely. So the SeaMicro business, we are very pleased with the pipeline that we have there. Verizon was the first major datacenter win that we can talk about publicly. We have been working that relationship for the last two years. So it\u2019s actually nice to be able to talk about it. We do see it as a major opportunity that will give us revenue potential in 2014. And we continue to see a strong pipeline of opportunities with SeaMicro as more of the datacenter guys are looking at how to incorporate these dense servers into their new cloud infrastructures.","Srini Pajjuri - CLSA Securities","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in the queue will come from the line of Kevin Cassidy with Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel","Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Just for a little more granularity on the Verizon. Are you only shipping SeaMicro product with AMD Opteron or does it also have Sea on [an add-on]?","Lisa Su","Yes. So, the clarification around SeaMicro servers. As I said the Sea -- the Verizon engagement has lasted over the past two years. So some of the initial deployments were with the Intel processors but we do have significant deployments with AMD Opteron as well.","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel","Going forward, we\u2019ll switch more to Opteron?","Lisa Su","We do see the percentage of Opteron processors increasing because that\u2019s what we\u2019d like to do.","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel","Great. Okay. Thank you.","Ruth Cotter","Operator, we\u2019ll take two more questions, please.","Operator","Understood. Our next question in the queue will come from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO","Thank you, Lisa. Since you are on a roll, I\u2019ll just follow-up on the server roadmap. What\u2019s the timing for 64-bit and then with ARM. And then specifically give us some insights into -- to the extents you can on how you aim to combine SeaMicro X86 and ARM? Thank you.","Lisa Su","Thanks Ambrish for the question. So again we\u2019re very excited about the server space. It\u2019s a very good market. It\u2019s a market where there is a lot of innovation and change. In terms of 64-bit ARM, you will see us sampling that product in the first quarter of 2014 that development is on schedule and we\u2019re excited about that. All of the customer discussions have been very positive and then we will combine both the 64-bit ARM chip with our SeaMicro servers that will have full solution as well.","So I think we view this combination of IP as really beneficial to accelerating the dense server market both on the chip side and then also on the solution side with the customer set.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO","What would be the timing for that, Lisa, for SeaMicro plus ARM?","Lisa Su","So you will see that in 2014.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) and it will come from the line of Patrick Wang with Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Patrick Wang - Evercore","Thanks for squeezing me in. I\u2019ve just got two questions. First, I guess, I\u2019m little bit confused about the way to think about the consoles make custom contribution in the fourth quarter. It sounds like you guys have made that graphics with the R7, R9 launches probably can be up.","CPU is down modestly with the markets and then, of course, earlier at this point, we heard [Jason C.] also talk about next vacation that console will be down a little bit in the fourth quarter in terms of wafer start. So can you just kind of help us -- maybe give a little bit more color in terms of the type of growth that we should be factoring into the fourth quarter?","Lisa Su","Yes Patrick. So let me kind of help with that. So if you look at the combined quarterly shipments for Q3 and Q4, they are very much in track -- on track with what we would have expected. If you look at the supply chain cycle, we buy wafers earlier to ship and the peak months are going to be October and November. So I think all of the data is consistent.","We did ship a few more units in Q3 than we originally planned just because of the strength of the production ramp. But we will see game console revenue go up in Q4 versus Q3, just as the both Microsoft and Sony are preparing for their holiday launches.","Patrick Wang - Evercore","Okay. So it sounds like it\u2019s more of a timing thing. And just my second question for Devinder -- I know, I think I looked at your guidance before commentary, you talked about positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter. Can you help provide us the timing of your payments due Globalfoundries. I see liability on your balance sheet. I know you\u2019ve got another $200 million coming in the first quarter. But how does that play out, how that work with your positive free cash flow?","Devinder Kumar","I think there are two parts to it. Right, so we have waived the purchase from Globalfoundries that we have purchased through this year. Earlier, this year, we did have some special payment that we made related to the limited exclusivity waiver that we got way back in 2012. And then we did it as a termination payment, we made about $120 million payment of that. There is another $200 million of that left to be paid in Q1 2014. So if you relate that from a cash standpoint, we have \u2013 as I have projected $1.2 billion of cash, revenues can be up in Q4, and then at the Q1 we collect the cash for the revenue that we are going to have in Q4, pay the $200 million and that\u2019s why I am projecting \u2013 maintaining at the optimal range of the $1.1 billion from the cash standpoint.","Lisa Su ","Thank you, operator. That concludes today\u2019s call and we would like to thank [indiscernible]. ","Operator","Thank you presenters and thank you ladies and gentlemen. Again this does conclude today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to AMD's fourth quarter 2013 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions.] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Ruth Cotter, vice president of investor relations for AMD. Please go ahead.","Ruth Cotter","Thank you, and welcome to AMD's fourth quarter and year-end earnings conference call. By now you should have had the opportunity to review a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary and slides. If you\u2019ve not reviewed these documents, they can be found on AMD\u2019s website at quarterlyearnings.amd.com.","This is a live call and will be replayed via webcast on AMD.com. Participants joining us on today\u2019s call are Rory Read, our president and chief executive officer; Devinder Kumar, our senior vice president and chief financial officer; and we\u2019ll also have Lisa Su, our senior vice president and general manager of global business units, who will participate in the Q&A portion of the call. ","There will also be a telephone replay. The number is 888-266-2081. Outside of the United States the number is 703-925-2533. The access code for both is 1485779. The telephone replay will be available for the next 10 days, starting later this evening.","I\u2019d like to highlight a few dates for you. Devinder will attend the Goldman Sachs conference on February 12. Our first quarter quiet time will begin at the close of business on March 14. And lastly, we intend to announce our first quarter 2014 earnings on April 17. Dial-in information for that call is expected to be provided in mid-March.","Please note that the non-GAAP financial measures referenced on this call are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in the press release and CFO commentary posted on our website, quarterlyearnings.amd.com. ","Before we begin the call today, let me remind everyone that today\u2019s discussions contain forward looking statements statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions, and expectations, speak only as of the current date, and as such involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. ","Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information. You\u2019ll also find detailed discussions about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC and in particular AMD\u2019s quarterly report on form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 28, 2013.","Now, with that, I'd like to hand the call over to Rory. Rory? ","Rory Read","Thank you, Ruth. We made good progress last year in executing our three-step strategic turnaround to restructure, accelerate, and ultimately transform AMD. We completed our restructuring, creating a more efficient business model with significantly lower operating expenses.","We also accelerated our business, generating strong revenue growth and a return to profitability in the second half of the year by successfully ramping our strong and diverse set of new products. As we move forward, we will continue to strategically transform AMD as we diversify our portfolio and drive a larger percentage of our revenue from the semicustom, ultra-low power client embedded dense server and professional graphics high growth markets.","In the fourth quarter, we delivered revenue of $1.59 billion, an increase of 9% sequentially and 38% from the year ago period, while increasing profitability. We exceeded the goal we set for the semicustom and embedded businesses to generate 20% of our revenue by the fourth quarter of 2013.","We believe this validates the strategy we outlined two years ago to embrace the trends reshaping the industry. We remain on track for our growth businesses to generate approximately 50% of our revenue by the end of 2015. ","All of this work is underscored by the improved execution across the AMD company, as we hit our key product, IP development, supply chain, and financial milestones in 2013. Our flawless semicustom production ramp propelled the business in the fourth quarter and allowed us to meet the strong demand for Sony\u2019s and Microsoft\u2019s game consoles.","Combined, Sony and Microsoft reported selling more than 7 million units in less than two months. This is more than double the number of prior generation consoles sold in their first quarter of introduction. We expect this momentum will continue as we increase game console SOC shipments for the year and pursue new wins from our semicustom design pipeline.","Our embedded business achieved sequential revenue growth increases throughout 2013. We have secured design wins to drive further growth and expect continued momentum as we begin offering both X86 and ARM-based solutions in 2014.","In dense servers, we remain on track to launch one of the industry\u2019s first 64-bit ARM server SOCs in 2014. Our unique position offering both X86 and ARM solutions, combined with our years of experience in the server market and industry leading fabric technology differentiates us as we bring an expanded set of solutions to this important market. We remain on track to begin sampling our new ARM-based SOCs later this quarter and we are seeing strong interest from both traditional server OEMs and end customers like cloud providers. ","Our professional graphics business set a record for the full year revenue in 2013. We believe we can drive additional growth based on incremental focus and investments we are making to further strengthen our product offerings, expand our work with key software developers, and secure more design wins. Apple\u2019s new Mac Pro desktop, with dual AMD FirePro GPUs, is a perfect example of our momentum and this margin accretive market. ","Now turning to our traditional businesses. As we said during our last earnings call, we expected GPU revenue to rebound as we accelerate the transition to our new R9 and R7 graphics chips, and that is what happened. Strong demand for our latest graphics chips drove a significant sequential increase in GPU revenue and ASP.","Our strategy to attack the desktop at [unintelligible] channel worked well in the quarter and we expect this trend to continue. We believe we are well-positioned to gain graphics market share in 2014 based on continued channel momentum, secured wins for our new R7 and R9 discrete mobile GPUs, and strong adoption in the professional graphics space.","We also delivered our third straight quarter of desktop processor revenue in the fourth quarter, largely driven by increased shipments of our higher end APUs and FX CPUs. We also began shipping the desktop version of our newest APU, Kaveri, in December, and we believe it will fuel future growth by delivering a significant performance advantage versus competitive offerings.","Kaveri supports our mantle API for better gaming experience and is the industry\u2019s first product to integrate HSA features that can improve performance and power efficiencies when running modern workloads.","The consumer notebook market remained soft in the fourth quarter. We focused on improving mix and reducing downstream inventory with our customers. We have secured a number of premium notebook design wins for Kaveri and also have solid adoption of our next generation low power Mullins and Beema SOCs, which deliver twice the performance per watt of our previous offerings.","We believe we are taking the right steps to create a more predictable and balanced PC business moving forward by continuing to drive a richer product mix, by focusing on parts of the market where we are underrepresented and have significant growth opportunities. For instance, we have secured a significant number of new commercial client design wins with tier one OEMs which will launch in the second half of the year.","We continue to believe that the PC market will be down for the year. As we discussed during the last earnings call, our planning assumptions are based on a 10% decline in the market. Since that call, we are seeing some signs that parts of the market may be stabilizing. ","Given where we are in the quarter, it is too early to know if these signals will continue or not. We are managing the business to the base assumption, but we are ready and poised to take advantage of any upside as it materializes.","So in summary, for 2013 we hit key milestones in our multiyear strategic turnaround. We completed our restructuring, creating a more efficient operating model. We accelerated our business by ramping a strong set of new and diverse products across both traditional and new growth businesses.","Our semicustom embedded offerings delivered more than 20% of our revenue in the fourth quarter, and we returned AMD to profitability and positive free cash flow in the second half of the year.","Now, in 2014, our next objective is to achieve revenue growth and profitability at the net income level for the full year, as we leverage our differentiated IP and products to further expand our growth businesses, participate across a broader part of the traditional PC market, to create a more balanced and consistent revenue stream and to continue to pursue efficiencies in our business model that will further reduce operating expenses.","We are midway through our multiyear turnaround and feel very good about the progress we have made to date and our abilities to continue to meet our commitments. We have built a solid foundation from which we can continue to transform AMD into a more diverse company, delivering consistent revenue growth and profitability.","Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Devinder. Devinder?","Devinder Kumar","Thank you, Rory. 2013 was a year of many accomplishments for AMD, as we completed the first two phases of our three-phase transformation plan. We completed the corporate reset and restructuring, and had solid execution in the second half of 2013. ","At the beginning of 2013, we laid out a number of key financial goals as part of that plan, specifically the return to profitability and positive free cash flow in the second half of the year to reduce our operating expenses by more than 20% from Q1 2012 levels and to generate more than 20% of our revenues from our semicustom and embedded products.","I\u2019m happy to report that we achieved and exceeded all of those goals. In addition, we maintained cash balances above our optimal balance of $1.1 billion throughout 2013, and stabilized the business with solid execution and financial discipline. All of this provides a good foundation as we enter 2014 and continue our strategic transformation.","Let me share some specifics for 2013. We achieved revenue of $5.3 billion; gross margin of 37%; non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.9 billion, down 14% year over year; non-GAAP operating income of $103 million, up from $45 million in 2012; capital expenditures of $84 million, down significantly from $133 million in 2012; and finally, we exited 2013 with cash balances, including marketable securities, of $1.2 billion, and increased available liquidity by $500 million through establishing a secure revolving line of credit. ","Now let me turn to the specifics of the fourth quarter of 2013. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2013 was $1.59 billion, an increase of 9% from the third quarter and an increase of 38% from the fourth quarter of 2012. The increase was driven by very strong performance in our graphics and visual solutions segment, driven by increased revenue from the semicustom SOCs and our new R7 and R9 series of GPU products, which more than offset the decline in revenue in our computing solutions segment.","Gross margin was 35%, down 1 percentage point sequentially, in line with our expectations, as sales of our semicustom SOCs grew significantly and formed a larger mix of overall revenue. The fourth quarter financial results include a $7 million benefit from the sale of inventory reserved in the third quarter of 2012, as compared to a similar $19 million benefit in the prior quarter.","Non-GAAP operating expenses were $462 million, above our targeted level of $450 million, primarily due to higher expenses in sales and marketing during the holiday period and employee related performance related programs.","Non-GAAP operating income was $91 million, and non-GAAP net income was $45 million, both of which exclude a net benefit of $48 million from legal settlements in the quarter. We delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.06 and adjusted EBITDA of $165 million, excluding a net $48 million benefit from legal settlements.","Now turning to the business segments, computing solutions segment revenue was $722 million, down 9% sequentially, primarily due to decreased chipset and notebook unit shipments. Computing solutions operating loss was $7 million, as compared to an operating income of $22 million in the third quarter, primarily due to decreased levels in revenue and higher marketing and employee related performance plan expenses.","Graphics and visual segment revenue was $865 million, up 29% sequentially, driven by increased shipments of game console semicustom SOCs and of our R7 and R9 series of GPU products. Graphics and visual solutions segment operating income was $121 million, up from $79 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to higher revenue.","Turning to the balance sheet, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balance, including long term marketable securities, was $1.2 billion, in line with our expectations and flat from the third quarter. Inventory was $884 million, down $38 million sequentially, primarily due to higher shipments of products in our graphics and visual solutions segment.","Our total wafer purchases from GlobalFoundries in 2013 were approximately $960 million, lower than the previously estimated $1.15 billion, due to lower third quarter purchases. There were no penalties associated with this reduction. We are actively working on our 2014 wafer supply agreement with GlobalFoundries based on our full year demand expectations, with a goal to manage inventory flat to down year over year.","Also, in the first quarter of 2014 we paid GlobalFoundries a final $200 million payment related to the reduction of our [unintelligible] wafer obligation commitments in 2012. That, as of the end of the quarter, was $2 billion, flat from the prior quarter.","During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $50 million of our outstanding 6% 2015 convertible senior notes in the open market, and these purchases were funded by utilizing our secured line of credit revolver.","Now turning to the outlook, for the first quarter of 2014 AMD expects revenue to decrease 16% sequentially, plus or minus 3%. We expect computing solutions segment revenue to be down in line with seasonality and we expect graphics and visual solutions revenue to be down coming off of a strong Q4 for our semicustom SOCs.","Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 35%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $420 million, driven by lower sales and marketing expenses, accelerated IP reuse, and rebalancing of resources in some of our businesses.","Inventory is expected to be approximately flat from fourth quarter levels and cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities are expected to be approximately $1 billion. On cash, we have had two important cash reference points over the past year: one, our optimal cash balance target of $1.1 billion and the other, our target minimum cash level of $700 million. ","In light of the progress in the transformation of our business model, with a more predictable revenue stream from our growth businesses and the availability of $500 million of liquidity available under our secured revolving line of credit, we are revising our optimal cash level to be approximately $1 billion and our target minimum cash to $600 million.","For the full year 2014, we expect revenue to increase year over year; non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of approximately $420 million to $450 million prior quarter, depending on the timing of R&D expenses and the revenue profile; taxes of approximately $3 million per quarter; to be net income profitable for the year; inventory to be flat to down year over year; capital expenditures of approximately $120 million; to be free cash flow positive for the year; and finally to maintain cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances in the optimal zone of $1 billion and above the target minimum of $600 million.","In summary, we achieved critical milestones in the first two phases of our strategic transformation during 2013, and delivered solid financial performance in the fourth quarter. We remain focused on maintaining the operational and financial discipline that we demonstrated in 2013 as we embark on the third phase of our strategic transformation, with the goal of transitioning 50% of our revenue to high growth markets by the end of 2015.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Ruth. Ruth? ","Ruth Cotter","Thank you, Devinder. Operator, we\u2019d be now pleased for you to poll the audience for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] And it looks like our first question will come from the line of David Wong of Wells Fargo.","David Wong - Wells Fargo ","Your microprocessor APU ASPs have been doing very well recently. What do you expect going forward in the March quarter? Does Kaveri help ASPs to rise?","Lisa Su","Let me answer that question. We have been working hard on the mix of our product portfolio in both desktop and notebook, and we saw a nice uptick in Q4. I think going forward we do have a strong set of products. We\u2019ll have to see how 2014 unfolds, but Kaveri, we\u2019re very pleased with the performance and the launch in the desktop channel. You\u2019ll be seeing that in the notebooks, and we\u2019ll also be introducing our new Mullins and Beema products later on in the year as well. So we\u2019ll continue to work on the mix of the computing solutions ASPs going forward. ","David Wong - Wells Fargo ","And my other question, Devinder, you did very well on the profitability in the December quarter. Will you be able to keep net income flat or positive as you go into the seasonal [low]?","Devinder Kumar ","I think as we gave the guidance for Q1, if you do the math, that\u2019s how it comes out. And our goal is obviously to be profitable for the year, and for Q1, with the revenue and the gross margin and opex profile that we have, our goal is to be breakeven or better from a profitability standpoint.","Operator","And it looks like our next question in queue will come from the line of Hans Mosesmann of Raymond James. ","Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James","Question on your ARM strategy and Seattle. Based on what you\u2019ve seen over the past quarter, has the opportunity in servers in that particular area increased? Has it been the same, or is it less?","Lisa Su ","On the server strategy and the ARM strategy with our Seattle product, I think our view is that the opportunity is definitely there. We\u2019ve always said that ARM is a longer-term opportunity in terms of how it folds into the server market, but what we\u2019ve seen is continued interest in our ARM product portfolio, not just from traditional server vendors, but also from some of the cloud vendors. So we\u2019re very pleased with the progress with that, and we\u2019ll continue to work hard with that strategy.","Rory Read","And also remember that we really want to continue to leverage ARM, not only across the server space, but also into embedded, and potentially into the semicustom space, as it gives us increased capability. We think that ambidextrous part of the strategy, and our leadership in 64-bit compute will give us a significant opportunity and an expansion in [TAM] that will give us long term opportunity to expand revenue. ","Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James ","If I may, a follow on. The Beema and Mullins APUs seem to go right up against Bay Trail from Intel. I asked the question last time, and I\u2019d like to ask it again, because I didn\u2019t get the proper answer, I suppose. What is the competitive advantage of Beema and Mullins versus Bay Trail? ","Lisa Su ","Let me try to answer that for you. Mullins and Beema are really targeted at the low power APU space. We just showed the latest performance metrics at CES, and what you\u2019ll see is that on graphics performance, it\u2019s substantially better. We\u2019re talking about 250% better in the comparable Bay Trail products. And what\u2019s different is on the computer performance, where we have traditionally been not a strong, we see significant performance improvements. So I think we feel very good about our positioning versus Bay Trail. We\u2019re continuing to be very aggressive with how we position our products in the space, and we will look for a balanced business going forward there.","Operator","And our next phone question will come from Chris Rolland with FBR. "," ","Chris Rolland - FBR","","Perhaps you can talk about the staggered geographic launch of the PS4 in Japan in February. I thought this might have made the GPU business a little less seasonal than normal, than we might have expected. And then also, I know you guys don\u2019t guide two quarters ahead, but given that staggered launch, what does that do for second quarter seasonality as well? Maybe we could get some color there.","Lisa Su ","Let me start, and then maybe Devinder and Roy can add. When you look at the game console market, it is a five, seven year market. When you look at the first year launch, there are those different components as you talked about in terms of the staggered launch. If you look at how it\u2019s progressed, Q4 was a very strong quarter. ","When you look at the launch quarter and the number of units sold that our customers have reported, double what you have seen in previous launches. When we look into Q1, we do expect a strong quarter as well, and looking into 2014, you would expect that the second half will be stronger than the first half. ","But I would guide you to look at when the major titles are released for the various game consoles to see when you\u2019ll see a little bit of, I wouldn\u2019t call it seasonality, but I would call it a little bit of uptick, as that happens. So I think expect strong momentum in 2014 off of the 2013 console launch. ","Chris Rolland - FBR ","And if you look at PC [unintelligible], let\u2019s say in 2012, you guys were down. Last year you guys were about breakeven on an operating profit basis. So even though you guys had PC units down, how are you looking at profitability for that PC [unintelligible] division in terms of operating profit for \u201914?","Rory Read ","Clearly, Chris, our focus is to continue on the next phase of this multiyear strategy we laid out two years ago. In 2014 our next goal is to drive full year revenue growth and profitability at the net income level for the full year. As we look at that, we think it\u2019s a combination of our expansion into the new growth markets, like embedded, professional graphics, semicustom, low power client, etc., dense server. ","But also, it\u2019s about the opportunities we see in the PC market. We believe the PC market will continue to be down in 2014, but we see an opportunity for us to continue to move into areas where we\u2019re underrepresented. Historically, we\u2019ve dominated that lower entry point of consumer notebook. ","Where we see opportunity is to continue to build on the momentum we\u2019ve seen in the revenue of the desktop channel, and then continue to expand into the commercial client segment. These are two key areas where we can provide leadership and we have been underrepresented in the past. These will give us an opportunity to expand and they\u2019re also areas that tend to have better growth performance than consumer notebook, because clearly consumer notebook in the entry space has been affected by the tablet. ","But that commercial area in desktop has been stronger and more resilient. We think that, as we mix up the stack, will continue to give us opportunity to produce profitability. In terms of A8s and A10s, it was a record, record quarter, in terms of A8s and A10s, up the stack, which is a perfect example of what we\u2019re trying to do, and why we saw the expansion on ASPs.","Devinder Kumar ","I can add on top of that. Rory talked about the products and the business execution. From a financial standpoint, our business is in the midst of a transformation. And our focus is that each standalone business has to be profitable and we will adjust resources and assets from time to time. And that\u2019s why you have seen, even in the computing solutions business, despite the fact that they were down from a revenue standpoint over the quarters, essentially for that segment we were close to breakeven, and that\u2019s the way we\u2019re going to manage in 2014 as we go forward.","Operator","And our next phone question will come from the line of Stacy Rasgon of Sanford Bernstein.","Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein ","I wanted to dig in a little bit first into the cash balance. So for this quarter, you were at $1.2 billion, but you didn\u2019t take about $190 million in wafers you were due, and you also cut your capex versus your guidance, which would have dropped you well below $1 billion had all that come through. Now you\u2019re dropping, I guess, your optimal target and your minimal target, and you\u2019re sort of attributing that to a better outlook on the business. ","But how can we read that as anything other than cash balances are coming in lower than what you thought, and so you\u2019re guiding down your targets in order to adjust to that reality? What\u2019s the confidence we have on the cash balance going forward? ","Devinder Kumar ","I think if you look at it from the standpoint of where you started, first of all, and the lower wafer purchases in Q4, taking those wafers in Q4, the cash we have been paid in Q1 would not have affected the Q4 cash balance. So that\u2019s where we ended up from a Q4 standpoint, with the $1.2 billion dollars. And I know you\u2019re familiar with the GlobalFoundries piece of it. We had $200 million due to GlobalFoundries in Q1 2014, and that money has been paid. ","And our business model has transformed, with more predictability of revenue, as I said in my prepared remarks, in particular with the semicustom game console business. And therefore, I\u2019m very comfortable from a viewpoint of resetting the cash balance to the $1 billion for the optimal range and $600 million minimum. ","On top of that, as you\u2019ve probably read, we closed a secured revolver line of credit, what we call the ABL in Q4, of which we have $500 million available. So when you take our cash balances at the end of Q4 2013, look forward to our profitability on the full year basis for 2014. I\u2019m confident we can free cash flow positive for the year, despite having paid the $200 million to GlobalFoundries, which we did in the early part of January.","Rory Read ","And Stacy, if you take a look at what a difference a year makes, at the end of 2012, our cash balance is basically exactly the same a year later, at the end of 2013. And arguably, probably the most difficult PC market in history. And I think we executed the plans that we laid out quarter by quarter to deliver that, and now we\u2019re moving into the next phase, as we continue to accelerate our business based on the new products we\u2019ve identified, the new growth markets. That\u2019s our objective to deliver free cash flow positive for 2014 as we deliver net income positive for the full year, and revenue growth for the full year.","Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein ","For my follow up, I wanted to just verify something on the GlobalFoundries. I guess it looks like they forgave some of the commitment. You said there were no penalties from the reduction. Does that mean there were no penalties, there weren\u2019t any, and there won\u2019t be any forthcoming? Or are you negotiating that as part of 2014, because the last time you couldn\u2019t take the wafers, you wound up still paying for them, you just had a little bit more time to pay for them. Are we basically done with the 2013 commitment at this point?","Devinder Kumar ","The 2013 WSA is completed. There are no associated penalties with the reduced wafers we took in Q4.","","Operator","And it looks like our next question in queue will come from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse ","I had a quick question about your seasonality for computing solutions. You said Q1 \u201914 revenue is expected to be down, partially being driven by seasonality of computing solutions. Do you view seasonality as [unintelligible] with that particular business?","Rory Read ","Our view is that we see seasonality in line in Q1, and I think that\u2019s good improvement from what we\u2019ve seen over the past several quarters as we move through this transition. We\u2019re looking for our compute business to deliver at seasonal trends, historical trends, in Q1. And if you remember, I said in the last earnings call that we weren\u2019t going to lean into Q4. We took that opportunity to prepare and control and burn down inventory, as well as position us for 2014. And I think what you\u2019re going to see based on our guidance is that compute will fall back into line with the historical trends. And I think that\u2019s good improvement.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse ","I think I wasn\u2019t clear with my question. I just wanted to get a better sense of how you view seasonality of your computing solutions for Q1. I guess is that somewhat like [unintelligible] mixing with [unintelligible] quarter over quarter? I just wanted to get how you view seasonality for the [unintelligible] business.","Lisa Su ","It varies from year to year, but let\u2019s say around 7-8% or so. ","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse ","And as my follow up, you said you expect revenue to be up year over year in \u201914. Do you expect both business segments to perform, and if so, do you expect one part of your business to outperform the other?","Rory Read ","We\u2019re in the transformation year of a multiyear transformation. We\u2019ve given the guidance for the quarter, and we\u2019ll lay that out. We do see an opportunity for us to deliver revenue growth for the full year, and that net income profitability for the full year, but generally we do not break that out at this point as we move through this transformation.","Operator","And our next question in queue will come from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura. ","Romit Shah - Nomura","Rory, I realize it\u2019s January, but I was hoping we could get some more color on the revenue target for 2014. You\u2019re guiding for growth, but being that the Street is modeling north of 15% growth, I think we\u2019re hoping for a little bit more color. Are you thinking more single digit growth, or are you a little bit more optimistic than that?","Rory Read ","From my perspective, I think as we\u2019ve gone through a very difficult and unprecedented 2013 from a market perspective, I continue to believe the PC market will be down in 2014, a similar amount. And as we discussed in our last call, we\u2019re basing our planning on that assumption. We see some parts of the market stabilizing for sure, in this early part of the year, but as we got to CES, we got kind of a mixed story there. ","So I think that from our perspective we\u2019re going to manage our business to that 10% base assumption, and if we do see upside, we\u2019re going to take advantage of it. Given we\u2019re in this very unpredictable stage of the market, and we\u2019re also in this transformation, I think it\u2019s prudent for us to give the guidance quarter by quarter as we move through this transformation. We\u2019ve shown our ability to deliver and execute quarter by quarter, and I think what we\u2019re saying is we see the opportunity to drive that revenue growth for the year. ","Let\u2019s get a couple more quarters under the belt, we\u2019ll lay that out as the year goes on, and see how the industry begins to unfold, and we\u2019ll lay out the year as we go. I think that\u2019s the prudent way to handle it.","Romit Shah - Nomura ","I agree. On PCs, which subsegments would you say are showing the highest degree of stabilization today?","Rory Read ","I think there\u2019s early parts of that. I think there\u2019s no doubt that the XP expiration has driven some activity in the commercial segment. It\u2019s one of the reasons Lisa and John Byrne and their teams have targeted the opportunity. You\u2019re going to see a substantial increase in the number of SKUs that we have, the number of models that we have, in the commercial segment. And I think that\u2019s done better over the past several quarters. I think it will continue to do better.","I think the component channel has continued to do well. The area that\u2019s been the most difficult, and obviously most affected by the tablet migration, has been entry level consumer notebook. And clearly, we were way over indexed in that space. Part of our strategy, diversify to the high growth markets, and within the traditional market, diversify into the segments within that PC market where we see future growth.","Lisa, you want to add anything else to that?","Lisa Su ","No, I think that covers it.","Operator","Our next phone question will come from the line of Patrick Wang with Evercore. ","Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners","For my first question, I wanted to see if you could talk a bit more about the semicustom business console. Lots of moving pieces out there, very, very strong ramp through the first couple of months here. How do you see the inventory situation? How much more demand do you think there is? I know you talked about expectations for growth year over year, but can you just help us kind of frame some of your expectations there?","Lisa Su ","Let me try and give you some color on that. So from everything that we see, the semicustom launch has been very successful, very strong uptake, both in sell in as well as sell through, on the inventory. Of course you\u2019ll see more of that from our customer data. From the visibility that we see into 2014, we see also strong uptake, and usually, as you know, these consoles tend to increase in numbers of units through the third and fourth year of console launch. So we see 2014 as a strong year for the overall games console market, in both the Sony and the Microsoft consoles.","Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners ","And can you talk a little bit about the profitability? I think a couple of quarters ago, you guys set a lower operating margin target. But how\u2019s the progress on that going, and how should we think about ASPs trending over the next one to two years as [NRE] comes off?","Devinder Kumar ","I think the operating margin, you\u2019re right, we had given, at the Q3 timeframe, and we were just starting to ship the product, margin guidance in the low double digits. [unintelligible] in the teens, as I said, for Q3, and in Q4, really we continue to improve. And over time, we believe that we can continue to increase the operating margin within that business. And that obviously benefits the operating margin of that business and the company.","And you can see the evidence, if you go look at the GVS segment results for this particular quarter, Q4, and the $865 million in revenue. We had about 14% operating margin, and that\u2019s really good. You know, I\u2019m not going to provide granularity of the operating margin for that particular part of the business on a go forward standpoint, but more looking in the operating margin trajectory between the businesses on the computing solutions, on the one hand, and GVS, the graphics and visual solutions, on the other. ","Lisa Su ","And on your question on ASPs and that trend, I think what I\u2019ll say is that the ASP reductions are well understood, and they\u2019re in our model. And with that, as Devinder said, we still expect over time to be able to improve the operating margins based on the execution of the products.","Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners ","And if I could squeeze in just one last question, just on the dense server business, it\u2019s probably my favorite one that you guys have. Could you talk a little bit about your go-to-market strategy? Do you think you\u2019re going to see an uptick from OEMs first? Do you expect early success with direct customers? Just any color you could give on [basic] penetration, things like that?","Lisa Su ","Let me try to do that. In the dense server business, last quarter we announced Verizon as our first mega data center win with our Sea Micro Systems, and that was a big deal. And we see that as really a cloud customer going forward. As we look forward, our dense server business has both chip and system sales, and so I think on the system side, you\u2019ll see more of the cloud customers and there\u2019s certainly a number of trials in progress. On the chip side, we\u2019re seeing interest from both traditional OEMs, and they expand their dense server focus as well as cloud customers and others looking to expand into the data center. So I would say on the chip business, it\u2019s more mixed, on the system business, we are very focused on those newer workloads.","Operator","And we do have time for one final questioner. Our final question for today will come from the line of Srini Pajjuri with CLSA Securities. ","Srini Pajjuri - CLSA Securities","Just one clarification, Devinder. Given your guidance, you\u2019re guiding at I guess PC down seasonally, which I think implies graphics to be down about 20% or so. I would have thought gross margins would improve a bit, just given the gross margin profile. I\u2019m just wondering why they\u2019re not improving. And then as the business rebounds in Q3, how should we think about gross margins?","Devinder Kumar ","I think if you look at it from the viewpoint of the computing solutions, we said down in line with seasonality, and Lisa mentioned earlier the 8%. On the graphics side, it\u2019s really a combination of the businesses in graphics and then obviously the semicustom business that obviously is going well from where we executed in Q4, and our customers continue to do well, even in Q1.","The mix of the revenue obviously is going to [bleed] to that 16% guidance that we gave, and that\u2019s where the gross margin comes out, given the mix of within the computing solutions and the graphics on the discrete [business] and the semicustom business. ","Srini Pajjuri - CLSA Securities ","Given that semicustom is lower gross margin, my question is, as the business comes back in Q2 or Q3, is there further downside to your 35% forecast?","Devinder Kumar ","I\u2019m not going to go further out in the year, because it\u2019s really going to depend, and when you get into the later part of 2014, how our growth businesses do, how the semicustom business evolves, given the launches that our customers are going to do in other parts of the world. And finally, obviously on the PC market, we have the transition going on. ","We are in the midst of a transformation, the business world is evolving. We\u2019ve done, as you probably have tracked, over the last few quarters, given the guidance for the gross margin, and meeting the gross margin guidance, and in Q1, the gross margin of 25%, and we\u2019re going to continue to manage that as we go through the year in 2014. ","Rory Read ","It\u2019s clear that we\u2019ve been on this multiyear journey, and clearly focused on positioning ourselves for this turn. I think 2013 is going to be remembered as a significant turning point in our history as we define this multiyear transformation to create a stronger and more profitable AMD. ","And as we look forward, I think you\u2019re seeing us target those segments that are going to have growth, look for those areas where we can expand our ASP, where we have opportunity to get new business, and to choose those businesses that are going to produce the profitability long term. Additionally, we\u2019ll manage the operating expense to deliver that. ","And you need to look at this as a body of work over the next two years. We\u2019ve done the first two years. Think about where we were just a year ago, and where we are today, and think about where we can get to this year, because the next goal is growing the revenue for the full year and that profitability and net income for the full year, and then by the end of 2015, 50% of our business comes from the new growth segments. That\u2019s a different AMD, and that\u2019s how we\u2019ll manage, quarter by quarter, step by step, through this strategy.","Ruth Cotter ","Thank you, operator. This concludes the call.

My name is Huey, and I'll be your conference operator for today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to AMD's Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]   As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Ruth Cotter, Vice President of Investor Relations for AMD. Please go ahead.","Ruth Cotter","Thank you, and welcome to AMD's Fourth Quarter and Year End Earnings Conference Call. By now, you should have had the opportunity to review a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary. If you've not reviewed those documents, they can be found on AMD's website at quarterlyearnings. amd.com.","Participants on today's conference call are Rory Read, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Thomas Seifert, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Papermaster, our Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer. This is a live call and will be replayed via webcast on amd.com. There will also be a telephone replay. The number is (888) 266-2081. Outside of the United States, the number is (703) 925-2533. The access code for both is 1563304. The telephone replay will be available for the next 10 days starting later this evening.","I'd like to highlight a few dates for you. AMD's Financial Analyst Day will be held on February 2; Thomas Seifert will attend the Oppenheimer Semiconductor Summit on the 23rd of February in Vail, Colorado; and our first quarter quiet time will begin at the close of business on Friday, March 16 and will be followed by the announcement of our fourth quarter earnings, expected to be Thursday, April 19.","AMD's ownership of GLOBALFOUNDRIES on a fully diluted basis decreased to approximately 8.8% as of the conclusion of the fourth quarter. Reconciliation for all non-GAAP financial measures discussed today is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings release, available in the Investor Relations section of amd.com.","Before we begin today's call, I'd like to caution everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements about management's expectations. Investors are cautioned that those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.","The semiconductor industry is generally volatile, and market conditions are particularly difficult to forecast. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC, where we discuss the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. You'll find detailed discussions about such risk factors in AMD's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October 2, 2011.","Now with that, I'd like to hand the call over to Rory. Rory?","Rory P. Read","Thank you, Ruth. 2011 was an important year of change for AMD. We took steps to optimize our business for today and position the company to seize the opportunities for tomorrow. We made good progress, but no question, we have more work to do.","First, we demonstrated that our innovation engine remains strong. The tremendous success of our low-power Brazos platform drove a 25% increase in mobile processor shipments and significant notebook share gains for the year. Brazos is, in fact, the most successful platform in our AMD history.","In Graphics, we exited the year the same way we entered it, with the world's fastest graphics chip. Our GPU IP provides us with superior video, multimedia and graphics capabilities that form the core of our competitive advantage.","And our Server business has regained momentum as adoption of the new Bulldozer-based CPUs continue to accelerate. As a result, we believe we gained overall microprocessor unit share for the year, and we are positioned well for growth as we continue to strengthen our differentiated product offerings.","Second, we continued to optimize our financial model, consistently delivering operating income and creating the foundation for sustained success. 2011 revenue was $6.57 billion, flat from 2010. And non-GAAP net income improved to $374 million, or $0.50 per share. Additionally, we significantly improved free cash flow as well, helping to strengthen our balance sheet.","Third, we took important steps to get fit to fight and write the next chapter for the AMD's history, a chapter that will be built on our rich heritage of innovation and improved execution. We strengthened our leadership team. The addition of industry veterans such as Mark Papermaster, Rajan Naik and Lisa Su will help ensure sustainable, dependable execution becomes the hallmark of the new AMD.","We implemented a restructuring plan and operational improvements in the fourth quarter. These actions will allow us to fund strategic initiatives designed to accelerate our growth by refining our focus on staking leadership positions in low power, emerging market and the cloud.","2011 progress was tempered by execution challenges that impacted our supply. We took several steps during the course of the year to better manage our foundry partnerships. Over the last 2 quarters, 32-nanometer yields and performance have steadily improved at GLOBALFOUNDRIES. As a result of the focus on improved execution, 32-nanometer unit shipments increased by more than 80% from third quarter to fourth quarter and now represent a full 1\/3 of our overall processor mix. Now looking more closely at the fourth quarter.","Revenue was $1.69 billion, flat sequentially and up 2% from a year ago. Record APU shipments and increased demand for our server chips resulted in strong financial performance in what turned out to be an unusually weak quarter for the overall industry. Revenue was impacted by lower-than-expected GPU demand and a one-time issue that limited supply of the 45-nanometer desktop processors. Working closely with our strategic foundry partner, we believe the 45-nanometer issues have been corrected, and we will see supply rebound in the first quarter.","Despite these challenges, we continue to improve our ability to meet our customer commitments. We also successfully transitioned the company to a lower-cost operating model while driving continued adoption of the latest innovative products. As a result, our non-GAAP net income improved to $138 million, or $0.19 a share, for the fourth quarter.","Now let's take a look at our client business. Our strategy to deliver the best experiences possible at mainstream price points continues to pay off, resulting in record APU unit shipments for the quarter. AMD APUs were in 5 of the top 6 best-selling systems in North America retail in the fourth quarter, including 2 of the most popular systems. AMD dominated the busiest shopping week of the year, powering more than 70% of PCs sold in the retail segment on Black Friday.","We saw a similar success in high-growth markets. For example, in China, we posted our third straight quarter of significant retail notebook share gains, and customer adoption of our APUs continues to increase. Design wins for our next-generation APU platforms are tracking ahead of the record number of design wins we secured in 2011.","We are seeing particularly strong customer interest in our expanded low-power APUs for 2012. The low-power versions of our next-generation chip, Trinity APU, delivers mainstream performance while using half the power of our traditional notebook processor. This processor fits into an ultrathin notebook design, as thin as 17 millimeters, providing industry-leading visual performance and battery life at very attractive price points. Trinity remains on track to launch for midyear.","Now looking at our Server business. We had our second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, largely due to the ramp of our new Opteron 6200 and 4200 processors. These new Bulldozer-based processors accounted for more than 1\/3 of our total server unit shipments in the quarter. Continued adoption in the high-performance computing market was bolstered by the introduction of several HP and Dell servers powered by the Opteron 6200 processor.","HP introduced 5 new ProLiant servers, including the world's and industry's fastest dual-socket database server ever produced. Dell also introduced 4 new PowerEdge systems, including the world's most efficient blade server. We believe we gained server share in the quarter, and demand for the 6200 Series remains strong.","Now looking at Graphics. Despite strong game console licensing revenue, lower demand for discrete notebook graphic chips and a seasonally weak desktop add-in board market for the quarter resulted in a overall revenue decline in our fourth quarter.","We introduced the first member of our next-generation AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series graphics family at the end of the quarter. The Radeon HD 7970 launched to universal industry acclaim as the fastest GPU on the planet. We completely re-architected this graphics engine in the 7970, improving performance per square millimeter by over 150%.","So in summary, our APU momentum continues to accelerate. Our Server business continues to strengthen, posting 2 straight quarters of double-digit growth. We continue to offer the fastest graphics technology on the planet, and we are seeing consistent improvement in 32-nanometer yields and execution performance.","In the near term, continuing to improve our execution will provide the greatest opportunity to increase value. This will, in turn, accelerate our growth and ensure we are in the right position to embrace the changes sweeping the industry around consumerization, the cloud and convergence. I believe AMD is uniquely positioned to take advantage of these key business trends.","AMD begins 2012 with a clear path forward. We know where our opportunities lie and what we need to do to seize them. Every AMD-er is focused on building an AMD that will deliver on its commitments with innovative products that anticipate the needs of our customers and the fast-changing market. I look forward to providing more details of our strategy at our Analyst Day next week.  With that, I'll turn it over to Thomas, who will cover the financials for 2011 and the fourth quarter.","Thomas Seifert","Thank you, Rory. 2011 was a year of solid financial execution combined with significant operational and strategic actions designed to position AMD for success in the target markets. We executed well to our 2011 financial model while strengthening our balance sheet.","We implemented efficiencies across the company's operations and reduced our headcount in the fourth quarter, which we expect will result in savings of over $200 million in operating expenses, most of which the company expects to re-invest. This re-investment will fund initiatives designed to accelerate AMD's strategies for low power, emerging markets and the cloud.2011 highlights include a strengthened balance sheet with debt reduced to $2 billion, down by $200 million in principal values from a year ago; achievement of the following 2011 financial goals: gross margin of 45%, positive non-GAAP operating income and improved non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow to $528 million as compared to $355 million in 2010.","In addition, AMD achieved several notable accomplishments. We shipped more than 30 million APUs to date and more than 100 million DirectX 11 graphic cores. We achieved several records: an all-time record for client microprocessor annual revenue and mobile microprocessor annual revenue and all-time records for mobile GPU annual revenue and professional graphics annual revenue.","Let's turn to the fourth quarter results. Revenue was $1.69 billion in the fourth quarter, flat sequentially as revenue growth in the Computing Solutions segment of 2% was offset by 5% revenue decline in the Graphics segment. Gross margin was 46%, up one percentage point quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to seasonal increase in game console revenue and improved GPU product mix.","Operating expenses were $601 million, less than guided, primarily due to higher-than-expected operational savings associated with the restructuring plan announced on November 3 of last year. We saw an immediate benefit from these actions, reducing costs by $40 million and improving earnings per share by $0.02 in the quarter.","R&D was $358 million, 21% of net revenue, and SG&A was $243 million, 14% of net revenue. Non-GAAP net income was $138 million, and non-GAAP operating income was $172 million. Interest expense increased by $1 million compared to the prior quarter, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.19, calculated using 740 million fully diluted shares.","Adjusted EBITDA was $260 million, up $21 million from the prior quarter due to higher non-GAAP operating income, driven by improved gross margin and lower operating expenses.","Now switching to the business segments. Computing Solutions segment revenue was $1.3 billion, up 2% sequentially, driven by double-digit growth in Server and Chipset revenue. Server revenue experienced growth for the second quarter in a row, driven by a sequential increase in unit shipments, primarily due to the ramp of the Opteron 6200 Series, which now account for more than 1\/3 of AMD's server processor shipments and revenue.","We achieved record quarter client revenue driven by an increase in supply of Llano APUs. And in Q4 of 2011, APUs accounted for nearly 100% of mobile microprocessors shipped and more than 60% of the total client microprocessors shipped. Microprocessor ASP increased sequentially due to an increase in mobile microprocessor ASP and an increase in server units shipped.","Computing Solution's operating income was $165 million, up $16 million from the previous quarter primarily due to lower operating expenses and an increase in server units shipped. Graphics segment revenue was $382 million, down 5% compared to the prior quarter mainly due to a decline in mobile GPU unit shipments, partially offset by a seasonal increase in game console revenue. Mobile and desktop GPU revenues declined due to seasonality, and GPU ASP increased due to product mix. Graphics segment operating income was $27 million, up $15 million from the prior quarter primarily due to higher game console revenue and higher GPU ASP.","Now let's turn to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance, including long term, at the end of the quarter was $1.9 billion, up $57 million compared to the end of the third quarter of 2011. Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter was $919 million, up $11 million compared to the end of the third quarter of 2011.","Inventory was $476 million exiting the quarter, down $64 million from the prior quarter due to a decline in GPU inventory driven by a transition to the newly-launched 28-nanometer product late in the quarter.","Debt at the end of the quarter was $2 billion. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $50 million principal value of our 6% notes, bringing the annual total repurchase to $200 million. Non-GAAP free cash flow was $100 million.","Now turning to the outlook. AMD expects revenue to decrease 8% plus-minus 3% sequentially for the first quarter of 2012.  Operating expenses are expected to be approximately $590 million, and gross margin is expected to be approximately 45% as we approach concluding our negotiations with GLOBALFOUNDRIES on a wafer supply agreement.","Our continued focus on financial performance and operational efficiencies has paved the way to position AMD as a strong competitor in the computing space. We're excited about our achievements to date as well as our capabilities and our road maps, and we look forward to sharing our exciting plans with you at our Financial Analyst Day on February 2 at our Sunnyvale headquarter.","With that, I'll turn back to Ruth.","Ruth Cotter","Thank you, Thomas. And Huey, we'd now be open to you polling the audience, please, for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]   Our first questioner in queue is John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I'm just kind of curious, Rory and Tom. When you look at the guidance you're giving for the first quarter, can you help us put that into context? Is there an assumption that the hard disk drive issue in Thailand is negatively impacting Q1, and that's reflected? Are there further share gains? And I'd be curious on the positive trend in servers whether or not you'll make it 3 for 3 as far as sequential growth.","Rory P. Read","There is no doubt that the customer acceptance of our APU architecture is quite strong. We've now shipped over 30 million of these APUs to date. And we're seeing a strong uptake in terms of that architecture, what it means to the customer. They are looking for a better experience, and I think that's a key reason why we've seen the momentum in our business and the ability to deliver on that. Our focus on execution around the APUs and around Llano is definitely paying off. And I think as we move forward, we should be able to continue to build on that momentum. Now at the end of 4Q, we did see a little bit of pressure in terms of hard disk, but we actually saw it in the area of the graphics chips. And this, we think, is going to be reflected in a very resilient PC supply chain that we think will recover relatively quickly. Our focus is to continue to focus on the right architectures, the right solutions that make a difference for those customers. We've seen the ability to meet those by improving our execution. I think that's got to remain our #1 focus. And while we saw a little bit of chop there in terms of hard disk impacting the graphics, I think we'll see a little bit more here in the beginning of 1Q, but I think this market should continue to recover. As it relates to server, that's 2 quarters in a row. We're starting to see a steady improvement in this business, and we want to build on that. I think the acceptance of the Opteron 6200 with the new launches around our key partners like HP and Dell are paying dividends. And you're seeing that momentum translate into higher growth, 2 quarters in a row. We're going to work hard to make it 3, and we're going to continue to work on delivering the kind of solution that makes a difference to the customer. Thomas, do you want to add anything?","Thomas Seifert","I think that's a fair balance. The product momentum we've seen, we expect to continue, as Rory explained, and we will see some headwind out of the shortages in certain segments and channels. Overall, it will lead to a pretty much a seasonal expectation for us for the first quarter.","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then, guys, as a quick follow-up, Thomas, just relative to the gross margin guidance, you kind of referenced the ongoing negotiations with GLOBALFOUNDRIES. Is that influencing the gross margin coming down a bit? Or is that mainly just the revenue and mix? And then I guess how do those negotiations impact kind of your longer-term view on the gross margin model?","Thomas Seifert","Yes, a very good question. So first of all, let me help you build a bridge. We see some tailwind -- headwinds in there, let me start there in the first quarter, just because of product mix and revenue being seasonally down. You know that in the fourth quarter, our game console licensing revenue helped us to exceed expectations. So we'll see some headwinds from product mix in there in the first quarter. And we see some tailwinds because of improving yields on the 32-nanometer side. We think if you take the gives and takes, you're going to come out at 45%, pretty much. The negotiations with GLOBALFOUNDRIES are making very good progress. We're very pleased with the results we have been achieving, and we think we approach the conclusion of those negotiations. And of course, the guidance we've provided today for the current quarter also reflects or is an assessment of where we are in there with the negotiation.","Rory P. Read","Yes, and I'd add, John, that I feel particularly positive about those negotiations going in the right direction. I think the partnership that we're trying to build first around focusing, around execution, we've been maniacally focused with our partners at GF, IBM, PDF and AMD all working together to address the execution challenges we had in 3 -- in the third quarter, and we've seen progress. As we move forward off of those successes and that partnership, I think the negotiations have moved forward well. And we're trying to work to put in place the kind of agreements that would allow us to have a strong base for the next 2 years to be able to deliver on our expectations and to move forward with a successful model that allows us to meet those customer demand and deliver on our financial commitments. So we're making very good progress there, John.","Operator","Our next questioner in queue is Glen Yeung with Citi.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Can you say whether or not your 32-nanometer yields are sufficiently good whereby you're now actually meeting the demand you have for that product? Or are you still a little bit short relative to demand?","Rory P. Read","No. So Glen, that's a very good question and focus. We've been intensely focused on addressing this execution challenge, and there's no doubt that this kind of focus is producing benefit. Week in and week out, we've seen steady improvement from where we started the quarter and where we ended 3Q. We've actually increased our Llano 32-nanometer product delivery by 80% from the third quarter, and now Llano makes up almost 60% of the mobile microprocessing revenue. I think this is a good step in the right direction. This gives us the momentum. And we were able to deliver in a more effective way on the customer demands. Is there a strong interest in the product? Absolutely. Do we need to continue to build on the execution progress that we've made? For sure. We're not out of the woods yet, but we're making steady progress. And with that, we've been delivering each and every week better and better and better. That 80% improvement quarter-to-quarter suggests a nice mix in terms of 32-nanometer and positions us again for 1Q. You're going to see us keep that focus, and it's our commitment to continue to improve that to deliver on every customer commitment, because building on that customer commitment, delivering on them, is the bedrock of developing long-term customer trust, which will fuel future growth.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Maybe as a follow-up just, again, on the Server side. Intel is about to ramp up the Romley platform for them. Do you think in the face of that, you can continue to grow the Server business? Or do you think we might see a temporary pause just as, again, as that new product from Intel ramps? Or is there something specific about the nature of where you're gaining on Server that you think you can continue to move forward with that?","Rory P. Read","Look, Glen, we've built on 2 steady -- 2 consistent quarters of improving growth. I think that shows the beginnings of a strong foundation. We've got to continue to build on that. And with the launches of the HP products, the Dell products, HP has now launched the world's fastest dual-socket database server, and Dell, the -- achieved the world record for power efficiency in the blade server space.  Those are good data points to say there's the interest and the desire. And when I look at on a weekly basis and I look at the pipeline of customer interest and demand, we're building on that week in and week out. Of course, with our relatively modest share position, our objective is to continue to build on this turnaround. We're just at the very beginning of this, and this is a long-term focus for us to build on quarter in and quarter out. Sure, there'll be new products introduced across the year and into next year. And we'll do the same. But it's about building those relationships with the enterprise customers, understanding their needs, making sure that we're delivering those products consistently with the execution. It's our focus to continue to build on that and move forward with these first 2 quarters of expanding growth.","Operator","Our next questioner in queue is Vivek Arya with Bank of America.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I think you mentioned 32-nanometer yield improvement at GLOBALFOUNDRIES. But you took a substantial $200 million-plus impairment charge in Q4. I guess can help us understand why? And more importantly, how do you see the mix of CPU at GLOBALFOUNDRIES versus TSMC in the future? And what would be the cost implications?","Thomas Seifert","Yes, I take the valuation question first. As you know, we began to account for our investment in GLOBALFOUNDRIES under the method of -- cost method of accounting last -- first quarter last year. And at that time, the investment was determined to have a value of around $460 million. We, as a company, review our investment for impairment indicators regularly. At the end of last quarter, we did this with GLOBALFOUNDRIES. And based on certain indicators, their future growth outlook, they have changed the time line on the new fab in Abu Dhabi. Their business plans have changed, and we reevaluated our investment in the company. It has decreased now down to $277 million, and we impaired for that very reason the investment we have. So that is not so much a statement about 32-nanometer yields at this point in time but about the bigger picture and long-term growth outlook of GLOBALFOUNDRIES and how they have adjusted their plans.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And GLOBALFOUNDRIES versus TSMC?","Rory P. Read","We're going to continue to build on the strong relationships that we've been developing with GLOBALFOUNDRIES as we move forward. You're going to see us continue to expand on the execution focus that we have and to continue to build on the expansions in terms of the process node technology. What we're really focused on is making sure we have the execution capability and to be able to deliver that consistently. Those foundry choices are all consistent with the financial objectives that we've created and the modeling that Thomas shared earlier.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And one quick follow-up, Rory, if I may. So very good progress in servers. But I've seen in the prepared remarks that you mentioned that there were some price declines, single-digit server ASP declines. Is that just a function of mix? Or is there some other factor here?","Rory P. Read","Yes, I think that's really driven, Vivek, by the mix and in terms of some of the early implementations to make sure we got that in place. As you're introducing a new product, we would expect to build off of that and to see the mix change as we move through the yield cycles and as we move through the launch.","Operator","Our next questioner in queue is Uche Orji with UBS.","Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, this is Steven Eliscu for Uche. First question is on Ultrabooks or ultrathin notebooks. Can you give us a sense of where you think, exiting the year, you -- the percentage of notebook processors that would be for the ultrathin SKU?","Rory P. Read","The movement to thin and light is nothing new. Customers want mobility. And the idea of ultrathin is something that we're very focused on. And if you think about it with our APU strategy that I mentioned, with the next-generation product, Trinity APU, we already are well ahead of the pace last year when we set a record-setting year for design wins with the Trinity product in 2012. With that product, we can deliver ultrathin in the range of 17 millimeters. And what's really important and I think we have to all focus on is ultrathin and mobility, the ability for computing to reach customers across the planet. Whether it's in high-growth markets, mature markets, we want to deliver that kind of mobility solution with a great experience, great graphics, low power in a thin mobile solution. And we want to do it at a mainstream price. That opens the door for this computing to a much broader portfolio. And our objective at AMD is to deliver that kind of technology, that kind of experience into the sweet spot of the market. And you're going to see us build on those design wins, record-setting in '11 with the original family set of APUs and moving forward with Trinity already outpacing and creating the records.","Mark Papermaster","Rory, it's Mark. And I'll add that the improvements that we've made in Trinity in both our CPU and the GPU are really delivering outstanding results in performance per watt. So as well for the ultrathins being able to hit the 17-millimeter low-profile, we're also getting a doubling of the performance per watt. So it's an exciting application of our APU technology.","Rory P. Read","I think you'll see mobility continue to expand. That's where we've seen strong growth in the market. IDC, Gartner, Mercury are all forecasting 2012 mobility to increase. It looks like they're forecasting a better year than '11 and '12, looking stronger in the second half than the first half. It doesn't matter. What's most important to us is to understand the market and the customer need and deliver the technology at the price points that create this for everyone. We want to create this kind of ultrathin-type solution that can reach the masses. Everyone.","Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Certainly would encourage to help give us a goal as you get further along with Trinity. A follow-up question.","Rory P. Read","I -- before you go on to follow-up question, Steve, one of the things which you might think about is coming to the Analyst Day next week, because we'll go into a little bit more detail around the strategy, what we're doing around convergence, around low power and kind of give you the view of where the whole thing goes. We have to focus -- well, you should go on to the next question.","Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I look forward to it.","Rory P. Read","Because you're getting me going, Steve.","Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That's great. On the server improvements that you've seen, historically you've done well in high-performance computing, and I think you've indicated data center is an area that will drive some of the new growth. Can you give us a sense as to the success you're having selling Opteron, the Interlagos into the data centers?","Rory P. Read","I think server is another one of these key areas that we're seeing a change in the marketplace. We're approaching an inflection point. There's no doubt in my mind that we're seeing a breakdown in some of the proprietary control points that have dominated the market for years. And I think in the server space, based on what's happening in the cloud, what's happening around convergence, the types of workloads that are going to be driven through these mega data centers, these cloud data centers, the kinds of solutions that are going to be created going forward are going to be tailored to very unique almost server appliances that allow us in dense kinds of solutions to introduce, I don't know, disruptive, really disruptive server plate that allows us to win. You'll see us continue to focus in the high-performance computing market, because that's always a forerunner of where next technology is going. We've got a strong foothold there. Continue to build on the database work that -- I mean, the traditional data center work that we're doing with the kinds of work around virtualization and around certain workload segments where our type of architecture really plays. And you'll see us get really aggressive around this disruptive play as we move forward. And so another area I'm sure Mark wants to comment on.","Mark Papermaster","Well, Rory, the investments we're making in low-power and performance per watt that we talked about earlier in Trinity are directly applicable to the server market. Our customers are telling us that our strategy, right, to double down in our road map, as we're doing, and bring these improvements across the applications that they're focused on, and as well as the agility that we're going to bring to our SOC in terms of bringing those solutions to market are going to hit exactly the improvements that our customers are saying where they need focus on their markets, focus on their workloads and servers.","Rory P. Read","And Mark, you're -- and Mark's on a really important point about architecture. The work that we're doing around our strategy and around architecture to give us the agility, the time to market, the kinds of re-use around IP, to give us the ability to tailor these solutions at the SOC level, at the server and platform level, these are some of the strategy that we want to cover in our Analyst Day next week. This is important stuff. This is important trends and strategies that allows us to really tackle this. And this is what's going to be differentiated as we see these inflection points accelerate. These trends are emerging now, but they're only going to accelerate. And that's what we have to do in AMD. Understand the market, the customer. Not focus on the past or the incumbent or chasing someone, but understand where the market is going, the customer's need and as this inflection point occurs, what's the architecture to tackle it and go get it.","Operator","Our next questioner in queue is Romit Shah with Nomura.","Sanjay Chaurasia - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","This is Sanjay Chaurasia for Romit Shah. My first question is on Windows and ARM, which could potentially target price segments where Brazos are currently being shipped. How do you think it will play out for you? And if in any way you are planning to participate in Windows on ARM devices? And I have a follow-up then.","Rory P. Read","Yes, Sanjay, can you just ask the first part of your question? I missed it. It was on Win 8. Was that what it was?","Sanjay Chaurasia - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Yes, it's basically Windows and ARM. And my question is, we feel that Windows and ARM devices could potentially target the price segments where Brazos is currently being shipped. And I just want to understand your take on that.","Rory P. Read","Sure, Sanjay. So our perspective is Win 8 is an interesting and important launch of technology. We think that it's going to drive interest and demand in the overall marketplace. And as I mentioned earlier, with our APU strategy, we are going to be ready to participate in that in the traditional spaces, in the ultrathin spaces and then move forward. I think you'll see architectures begin to dabble in that x86 space. Remember, these are 32-bit architectures at the beginning of these implementations. Windows is performing really efficient with -- efficiently at the 64-bit level. And while these are first forays into that space, we'll see some of that around this trend of convergence. There's no doubt about it. But what we have to do is focus on creating the technical solutions with the APUs that are low power, that are at the right price point, that delivers the full graphics experience, the long battery life, the quick start-ups and the ability to have backward and forward compatibility. That's an advantage, and that allows us to continue to build on that. People talked about ultralow power in the past and other things like that. Those weren't as successful as we'd hope, because they were a little bit underpowered or under-capable. This trend will emerge. We're ready to participate in Win 8, and we're going to -- we're excitingly looking forward to its launch.","Sanjay Chaurasia - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And the second question is on desktop segment. I remember from last call it went down significantly because of shortage of 45-nanometer parts. I was wondering where we are on that. You mentioned that there were some issues were resolved. But going forward, is that still tied to 32-nanometer yields? Or we can see unconstrained supply of desktop parts going forward?","Rory P. Read","Yes, what we believe now is that as we exit the quarter, we had a little bit of an excursion around the 45-nanometer supply in the late part of the quarter. Desktop is an important segment for us. I think we're seeing more consistency in the execution.  As you have heard me mention earlier, we've increased our delivery around 32-nanometer Llano by 80% from the third quarter, up 80% from the third quarter. That means that we're getting more efficient in terms of the yields. We're not consuming the same number of wafers. That allows us to address the desktop space. Without that conversion -- excursion, I think we're in a strong position there. But I believe that in 1Q, that you'll see us continue to rebound around desktop supply.","Operator","Next questioner in queue is Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","The question is sort of the direction of the CPU market over the course of the year. Your competitor kind of saw similar guidance as you did in the first quarter and then kind of normal seasonality in the second quarter and maybe a big pickup around the back half of the year, maybe even kind of historically good pickup in the back half of the year around some of the Windows 8 and Ultrabook launches and things of that nature. Is that pretty consistent with how you would see the market? Or would you see it any differently?","Rory P. Read","Well, first, as we look at it at the macro level, the macroeconomic environment on a global stage is a little bit unpredictable. You can never really be 100% sure. When we take a look at what we're hearing from our analysts around IDC, Gartner and Mercury, there's a general consensus that '12 looks a bit stronger than '11, that the second half looks a little bit stronger than the first half. Our focus is around improving our execution. That's the first step that we can create value in the firm, deliver on our customer expectations. We believe we're on the right track with the APU architecture and strategy, and you're going to see us continue to evolve that. And I think what we're focused on is that customer, that execution, that architecture. And what's key for us is to continue to build on the growth and that share focus quarter in and quarter out. We'll be ready for what the market throws at us. We're going to go based on what the general consensus is from the analysts around growth for '12. I think '12 is a little bit better than '11 and is a little bit stronger in the second half based what -- based on what we see their forecast to be.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then if I could ask as my follow-up. And I understand and kind of applaud the focus on execution. I guess, though, you can't execute in a vacuum, and you have to think about the environment going on with your competitors. And your competitor is just spending an unprecedented amount of CapEx and planning to bring on an unprecedented amount of leading-edge capacity. How do you think about that as it relates to pricing, as it relates to competing on new nodes, again, with a -- with your renewed focus on execution in mind?","Rory P. Read","We're going to cover this in a lot more detail at next week's Analyst Day out in California, and I think that's important. But as you think of the industry trends around consumerization, cloud and convergence, there's no doubt, as we've seen these kinds of inflection points in the industry, there's always a significant downward pressure in terms of the price points. So if you're dragging huge asset base along with you and there comes pressure into the market around those price points, that could put pressure into their -- into a business model. Our focus is to create the kinds of APU processors that give the excellent performance, the excellent experience around our graphics IP, our video IP, our low-power solution and a solution that we believe is very agile, one that we can apply across that, and we can hit price points that are very comfortable for us. We think the emerging market and the entry -- and the high-growth markets around entry and mainstream will be the hottest segment, and I think that's playing to our hand. We're going to emphasize this strategy. We want to embrace this inflection point that's emerging. We want to accelerate it, because shift happens when there's these inflection points.","Thomas Seifert","Yes, let me make one further comment. Of course, we see the investment of our competitor, but the fabless ecosystem is not sitting still. And if you look at the investments that are done on their -- TSMC, at a GLOBALFOUNDRIES and a GLOBALFOUNDRIES and alliances level, then the numbers are very comparable. GLOBALFOUNDRIES and their partnership models invest about $9 billion this year. TSMC sits around $6 billion, if I recall the number correctly. So this is, in terms of scale and absolute numbers, are very comparable to what Intel is putting on the table.","Operator","Next questioner in queue is JoAnne Feeney with Longbow Research.","JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC","I'm trying to get into a little bit more detail on the Server side. One thing I'm curious about is if there's any change in mix between where you typically sell, which is at the higher end, the 4P or larger servers, and perhaps the more volume-oriented 2P segment with the Bulldozer traction you're having thus far, or if you anticipate such a mix change and if that might be also what's behind the ASP change that you talked about.","Rory P. Read","Well, I think what you're seeing in the beginning of the launch, obviously, we build on that strong foundation that we've had in the high-performance computing market, some of those long relationships that we've created there. Now with the introduction of the ProLiant solutions from AP -- HP, not AP, HP -- and now with the Dell blade servers, the PowerEdge blade servers that we're introducing, now we're introducing a wider swath of product set. They're across multiple types of node solutions. We're further into the launch now, so you're getting a much wider spread in terms of the yield across the mix. I don't think we saw anything unusual for the first initial quarter, 1.5 quarters of this launch in terms of mix. I think you'll see us build on that as we move forward here in 1Q and 2Q, but nothing unusual in terms of that mix.","JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, that's very helpful. And then on the notebook side or, more generally, 32- versus 45-nanometer side, so it sounds like a very nice increase in yields on 32-nanometer. And so what I'm curious about is since 32-nanometer increased, shipments increased so much in the fourth quarter but overall computing revenue increased by far less, is that a sign that there was a pretty steep drop in 45-nanometer production? And how does that, then, shape up for the transition from the fourth quarter to the first quarter?","Rory P. Read","Well, I think we're pretty pleased with the focus on execution, as I mentioned earlier in the call, in terms of that momentum across the APU space. And then combine that with the server space, good progress there. The only part of the portfolio that was a little bit choppy was, as I mentioned earlier in my prepared remarks, were around the graphics space. That was a little bit different, and I thought the add-in board market was a little bit affected this December based on that hard disk kind of chop in the channel. We've -- we are not dramatically affected by that because of -- more of our focus is on the execution side. So I feel pretty good about where we are in terms of the transition around 32. I think that we're on track to launch the next APU platform around Trinity, as I mentioned earlier. With the kind of design wins that we're getting there, that positions us well. We've got, still, interesting demand around 45 in terms of some of the product sets in the channel, mainly around desktop, and we'll continue to work that technology through, especially in the high-growth and emerging markets. So I'm not seeing anything, JoAnne, in that mix that's terribly unique. I think we're at a good point in terms of those crossover curves that we run in terms of transition and with the improved execution. And I want to emphasize, we've made real progress, but we're not finished with that. And we need to continue to work every day with those tiger teams we've put in place. We're tracking the test vehicles through the lines to make sure that we're getting that consistent improvement, because that will reduce our consumption of wafers and give us far more flexibility in our supply chain. So while we have improved by 80% from the third quarter, we're not all the way there yet, and we need to keep that maniacal focus on execution this quarter and the rest of 2012. That's the key to building initial value for our shareholders and partners.","JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC","So that improvement, then, are you suggesting there's more yield improvements possible on that 32-nanometer line?","Rory P. Read","Absolutely. And that's our objective, and we're working on it week in and week out. And we're -- we believe there's more of that for weeks and weeks to come.","Mark Papermaster","And those same techniques and practices that the teams -- the tiger teams applied on 32-nanometer, that momentum continues in the 28-nanometer. And so that poises us well going into the coming 2012.","Operator","Our next questioner in queue is David Wong with Wells Fargo.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Your Q1 guidance, your March quarter guidance, does it assume that desktop and Llano sales will be tracking demand? Or does it actually incorporate some assumption of increasing supply driving shipments above demand?","Thomas Seifert","I'm not sure that I completely understand your question.","Rory P. Read","Yes, can you run it back again, David?","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes. Well, you had -- you have yield constraints in the December quarter. You talked about how the 45-nanometer at desktop also was supply constrained. So therefore, your guidance for the March quarter, does that assume that the sequential growth or decline -- that the trend will be better than the normal demand trend? Or are you actually tracking demand? Are you actually going to -- is the pattern of your sales going to equal the normal demand trend?","Thomas Seifert","Well, I think it's fair to say from the improvements we have seen and the -- and our foundry partners that we are not going to be supply-constrained in the first quarter.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Great. And my other question was do you anticipate when Trinity actually does start shipping that Trinity will have better yields and better gross margins than Llano at the time the Trinity starts out?","Thomas Seifert","The time that Llano started out, I assume. Well, we are not going to give granular product-based gross margin, as you know. But I think the progress we have seen on Trinity has impressed us. And of course, all the learnings that have been done on 32-nanometer with the Llano product will be transferred to Trinity. So the start-off pace with Trinity is going to be significantly better from a yield perspective compared to where we were at Llano launch. So that makes us quite optimistic looking forward.","Operator","Next questioner in queue is Patrick Wang with Evercore Partners.","Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","The first one for Thomas. I want to go back to, I guess, John's early question about the wafer supply agreement. Can you talk about when the current agreement expires, how that's impacting your gross margins and when you think the new one needs to be in place?","Thomas Seifert","Well, there is not a -- good question. There's not a real firm time line in place, and there's also not a black-and-white date when it's going to end and when it's -- the new one is going to start and it will have a black-and-white impact on our business model. We have been working together with our partners in a very productive manner. We've achieved significant progress. We are pleased with the approach. And as we said in our -- in my prepared remarks, we are really close to coming to a conclusion. And of course, the guidance we've provided for the current quarter, as I said before, is an assessment of the progress we have been making in those negotiations.","Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, got you. So I guess stay tuned for that. And then I guess, Rory, I want to follow up on servers a bit, here. Clearly, you're seeing some momentum, a couple of quarters of growth. I guess a couple of parts. First off, where are you seeing an initial design traction? Second, do you expect server ASPs to increase now that you're getting parts out there to your customers? And then lastly, there's been a lot of chatter out there and a lot of activity in nontraditional server design, lots of guys doing designs on ARM and things like that. Can you offer your thoughts on that as well?","Rory P. Read","This is not a problem. From a server perspective, as I commented earlier, the initial momentum is driven around our success in the high-performance computing market. We see always a very early uptake in terms of our key partners in those segments. Then you go and focus with the launches around HP and Dell in terms of their server market, more of a traditional space around virtualization and around business workload. We're seeing good pipeline activity there around the launch, and the trend looks solid. ASPs, obviously we'll work always to try and improve our mix. That's in our best interest. The demand is out there. And with our relatively modest share position, there's a lot of opportunity for us to attack. So I think we're off to a good start, but this is just the beginning of a long-term focus on server to build on that. And then, of course, I think in the disruptive play, maybe Mark wants to add a comment on some of the thoughts that we have in that disruptive space.","Mark Papermaster","Sure. And building on my comment earlier, our focus on low-power, our focus on leveraging, our CPU and our GPU IP plays dead-on in terms of what we see as disruptive opportunity in the server market space. Targeting workloads, targeting problems our customers have where they need more efficiency and our IP can directly attack it. So we are very focused on this area. And in fact, next week at our Financial Analyst Day, we'll be providing additional color.","Rory P. Read","And remember, there is clearly a series of inflection points that are beginning to emerge that are going to drive this space for the next 3, 5, 7 years. Whether it's server or client, that cloud impact, that power, that convergence, consumerization, these trends are just beginning to start to accelerate. And they're over a long period of time. We want to embrace those changes, want to embrace that transition. And we believe that the work that we can do in this disruptive space that we'll cover next week will be very interesting. But clearly, we've got good business now in high performance, we're making some good progress in terms of traditional data center workload and then we want to go in and embrace and attack this disruptive opportunity, Patrick.","Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got you. I guess one of the key things I'm looking forward to is just an update on that FSA I\/O. So look forward to seeing you guys next week.","Rory P. Read","Yes, no worries. We'll see you there.","Operator","And we have time for one final question. Kevin Cassidy with Stifel, Nicolaus, please go ahead.","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","On the GPU weakness that you saw in notebooks, do you think any of that is related to APU? And do you think GPU -- discrete GPU adoption is declining?","Rory P. Read","It's interesting. As I commented earlier, Kevin, we finished the year the way we started the year. We finished the year with the fastest GPU product on the planet. And I think it's kind of amazing. The 7970 Radeon HD board is an industry leadership. It really is. And our focus around driving industry leadership at the discrete GPU level is not going to change. And our focus on using that IP and technology in our APUs is spot-on. We want to continue to build on that momentum and drive forward. There's lots of forecasts out there, the trend on discrete over time with APUs and with the way we're going to embed that, the trend has to trend down over a period of time. But this is a good market, a market we continue to protect and attack to win moving forward. I think the kind of chop that we saw at the end of the quarter was really a little bit around the channel space and the kinds of pressure that we saw in the channel around some of the hard disk issues. Well, we have a relatively balanced business across the space, and we've been very able to focus on execution to drive that revenue consistently a quarter. We did see a little bit of that chop. But no doubt, Kevin, we're -- we see this as a very attractive market. We see this as a market that we can use the IP across the space. And again, finish the year the way we started: the world's fastest, the fastest graphics engine on the planet.  On the planet.","Ruth Cotter","And operator, that concludes our call.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ruth Cotter, Senior Vice President, Human Resources, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ms. Conner.","Ruth Cotter - Chief Human Resources Officer and Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications, Investor Relations","Thank you, and welcome to AMD's first quarter conference call. By now you should have had the opportunity to review a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary and slides. If you've not reviewed these documents, they can be found on AMD's website at ir.amd.com.","Participants on today's conference call are Lisa Su, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Devinder Kumar, our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. This is a live call and will be replayed via webcast on amd.com.","I would like to highlight a few dates for you. Devinder Kumar will present at the JPMorgan Global Technology Media and Telecom Conference on May 24 in Boston, and our second quarter quiet time will begin at the close of business on Friday, June 17, 2016.","Before we begin, let me remind everyone that first quarter 2016 was a 13-week quarter for AMD, and we expect to record our extra week in the fourth quarter of 2016.","Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations; speak only as of the current date, and as such involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please note that we will be referring to non-GAAP figures during this call except for revenue, which is on a GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures referenced are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the press release and CFO commentary posted on our website at quarterlyearnings.amd.com.","Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's earnings press release and CFO commentary for more information. You'll also find detailed discussions about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC, and, in particular, AMD's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 26, 2015.","Now with that, I'd like to hand the call over to Lisa. Lisa?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Thank you, Ruth, and good afternoon to all those listening in today.","Our strategy to improve our business by gaining share in the Graphics and PC markets, growing our Semi-Custom business and expanding into the datacenter market is progressing as planned.","First quarter revenue decreased in line with expectations to $832 million, driven largely by an anticipated reduction in Semi-Custom shipments. Looking at our Computing and Graphics segment, against the backdrop of one of the largest sequential Q4 to Q1 declines in the PC industry and ongoing softness in the Chinese PC market, we continue to execute our multi-quarter plan to improve the financial performance of this part of our business. Revenue decreased 2% sequentially, as improved notebook processor, desktop GPU and professional graphics sales offset declines for our other PC products.","We reduced our operating loss from the prior quarter, outperformed the PC market and believe we regained processor and GPU share. Importantly, we accomplished this while maintaining our disciplined approach to managing inventory in the quarter, as our inventories with MNCs and downstream channel partners were flat to slightly down sequentially.","We had our second straight quarter of double-digit sequential percentage growth in mobile APU sales. We began shipping our seventh-generation Bristol Ridge APUs in March, and have secured new design wins that continue our expansion into more premium notebook offerings, including HP's new ENVY x360 convertible notebook. Compared to our previous generation 15-watt APU mobile offering, Bristol Ridge delivers a 20% improvement in our already industry-leading graphics performance, and up to 20% CPU performance uplift.","In Graphics, we delivered a strong sequential double-digit percentage increase in desktop discrete unit shipments largely driven by increased sales of our Radeon 300 Series GPUs in the channel. Our investments in Graphics and our focus on creating industry-leading drivers and software are starting to pay off. We have delivered seven new Graphics drivers releases in the first quarter alone, not only improving the performance and user experience of our GPUs, but also adding support for a new AAA game titles and features like our innovative XConnect external GPU technology. We expect to grow our investment in Graphics throughout the year as we further update our Graphics software and extend our leadership in DirectX 12 gaming and VR.","We believe VR will be a key long-term demand driver for AMD, across both our consumer and Professional Graphics offerings, especially as content creators require more powerful GPUs to create fully immersive VR experiences. To capitalize on this trend, I'm proud to share that we plan to launch the industry's most powerful platform for VR creation and consumption at the end of this month, when we introduce the $1,500 Radeon Pro Duo.","We remain on track to introduce our new 14-nanometer FinFET based Polaris GPUs midyear. Polaris delivers double the performance per watt of our current mainstream offerings, which we believe provides us with significant opportunities to gain share.","Now turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Revenue declined 24% sequentially due to lower Semi-Custom sales. Based on our current visibility, we expect Semi-Custom unit shipments and revenue to grow, on an annual basis, based on strong demand for game consoles and the ramp of our previously announced new business in the second half of the year.","In Embedded, we secured new designs across our target markets. Highlights from the quarter include our first significant CPU design win with one of the leading network infrastructure providers. I'm also pleased to share that we are making excellent progress on our strategy to reestablish our presence in the datacenter market, as we successfully passed several key milestones related to our next-generation Zen-based server processor. The Zen silicon running in our bring-up labs is meeting our expectations, and priority customer sampling is on track to begin this quarter in advance of datacenter system availability in 2017.","Our EESC results in the quarter also benefited from the latest step in our strategic IP monetization efforts. As we've disclosed earlier today, we have licensed high performance microprocessor technologies to a newly created JV we formed with THATIC. The JV will develop SoCs tailored to the Chinese server market.","The $293 million licensing agreement is a great example of how our IP monetization efforts can accelerate the adoption of AMD technologies in key markets while also strengthening our balance sheet and financial results.","Today's announcement is a key part of our overall strategy to re-enter the datacenter market, with the JV providing AMD with a differentiated approach to gain share in the fastest growing regional server market.","In closing, we're making steady progress on the clear strategy we have developed to return AMD to growth and profitability through delivering great products. We are executing well to our product and technology roadmaps, including the introduction of our seventh-generation APUs, our midyear launch of new Polaris GPUs and our future Zen-based processors.","As we enter into the second quarter, we see strong demand for our Semi-Custom and Graphics products, which we believe will lead to stronger than seasonal sequential revenue growth. For the full year, we are confident that our product portfolio and business execution can further strengthen our financial results and enable us to grow annual revenue and return to non-GAAP operating profitability in the second half of the year.","Longer term, we expect a strong customer interest in AMD's datacenter offerings will result in new design wins that can deliver profitable revenue growth in 2017 and beyond.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our first quarter financial performance.","Devinder Kumar - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP","Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. From a financial perspective, the first quarter came in as expected.","We continued funding our roadmap products and also made progress on our IP monetization strategy with the execution of a licensing agreement that is expected to generate $293 million of cash before tax, contingent upon achieving certain milestones.","Let me review the results for the first quarter. As a reminder, our first fiscal quarter was a 13-week quarter. Revenue was $832 million, down 13% sequentially, driven primarily by lower sales of Semi-Custom SoCs. The year-over-year decline was 19%, due primarily to lower sales of Semi-Custom SoCs and client notebook processors.","Gross margin was 32%, a 2-percentage-point improvement from the prior quarter due primarily to a more favorable product mix and a mix of revenue between the business segments. Operating expenses were $332 million, up $9 million from the prior quarter primarily due to increased R&D expenses related to new products, partially offset by lower SG&A expenses.","Operating expenses were $12 million higher than guided, primarily due to the timing of mass and hardware for our new products and some incremental investments in Graphics. Operating loss was $55 million, and net loss was $96 million with loss per share of $0.12 calculated using 793 million shares. We recognized a $7 million licensing gain associated with our IP monetization efforts in the quarter.","Net interest, other expense and taxes were $41 million in the quarter, down from $53 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to a $13 million tax settlement in Q4 2015, which was included in the GAAP results. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $22 million, compared to negative $5 million in the prior quarter.","Now turning to the business segments. Computing and Graphics revenue was $460 million, down 2% from the prior quarter, primarily due to lower desktop processor sales. Computing and Graphics segment operating loss was $70 million, compared to $99 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to decreased operating expenses.","Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $372 million, down 24% from the prior quarter, primarily due to lower sales of our Semi-Custom SoCs. The operating income of this segment was $16 million, down from $59 million in the prior quarter, driven primarily by lower revenue and higher R&D expenses, partially offset by the IP licensing gains.","Turning to the balance sheet, our cash and cash equivalents total $716 million at the end of the quarter, down $69 million from the end of the prior quarter, primarily due to lower sales and higher debt interest payments of $69 million in Q1. Additionally, our Q1 results include $52 million net of taxes received from our IP licensing agreement.","Inventory was $675 million, down $3 million from the end of the prior quarter. Total wafer purchases from GLOBALFOUNDRIES in the first quarter were $183 million, including $155 million related to the 2015 WSA amendment taken in Q1 2016.","Debt, as of the end of the quarter, was $2.24 billion, flat from the end of the prior quarter, including total borrowings of $230 million on our secured revolving line of credit, unchanged from the prior quarter. Free cash flow in the first quarter was negative $68 million, compared to a positive $27 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.","Before providing our outlook for the second quarter, let me provide an update on our ATMP joint venture with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics. Earlier this month, NFME's shareholders approved the transaction. And we are currently in the final stages of obtaining regulatory approvals, and expect to close the transaction this quarter.","Now turning to our outlook, which is based on the 13 fiscal week quarter. For the second quarter of 2016, we expect revenue to increase 15% sequentially, plus or minus 3%, driven by a strong demand for our Semi-Custom and Graphics products; non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 31%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $335 million; IP monetization licensing gain to be approximately $25 million; non-GAAP interest expense taxes and other to be approximately $45 million, including approximately $3 million of taxes related to the IP licensing gain; cash and cash equivalents to be approximately $950 million, including approximately $320 million related to our ATMP joint venture; inventory to be up slightly from first quarter levels.","For the full-year 2016 we continue to expect revenue to grow year over year, to be non-GAAP operating profitable in the second half of 2016, and to generate positive free cash flow from operations for 2016. Also we now expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between $330 million and $350 million per quarter; IP monetization licensing gain of approximately $52 million, with $7 million already recognized in Q1 2016; and capital expenditures of approximately $80 million. For the rest of the full-year 2016 outlook, please refer to the written CFO commentary document posted on amd.com.","In closing we continue to strengthen AMD's core business, while leveraging our IP and technology. As we look to the rest of the year, we are focused on introducing compelling new products, regaining market share, and improving our financial performance.","With that I'll turn it back to Ruth. Ruth?","Ruth Cotter - Chief Human Resources Officer and Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications, Investor Relations","Thank you, Devinder. Operator, we'd be very happy for you to poll the audience for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question today is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Thanks for taking my question. And I guess this is one of the most exciting developments that we've heard about in a while, the license agreement. And I was hoping that you could maybe provide some more color on that.","Could you help us understand \u2013 maybe just go back in time and just explain the cross license agreement that you have with Intel? What should investors understand about that? And assessing any kind of a risk associated with this IP agreement? Do you tell Intel that this is going on? And did you get clearance from them? Or is this something you just kind of run with? And do you have to wait for like regulatory approval to get this through or \u2013 and how should we think about timing and milestones? So that's a lot of questions. I'll stop there. Thank you.","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Okay, Mark. This is Lisa. Thank you for your question. And regarding the JV that we just announced, yes, we are very excited about it, partnering with THATIC and really focusing on the Chinese market for server processors. What we are licensing in this agreement is microprocessor technologies and system-on-chip technologies. All of the technologies licensed are AMD technologies. So, there are no encumbrances from that standpoint.","We have closed on the deal, and we are starting execution of the deal. So, we've talked about, from a financial standpoint, there's a $293 million licensing payment over a number of years. What we expect is the first payment we received in the first quarter of $50 million-ish. And we expect that over the first two years that about half of the licensing payments would be paid upon completion of some development milestones.","So, overall for us, I talked about IP monetization in a very broad sense. For us, that includes patents as well as technology licensing. This one is very positive for us, not just from the standpoint that it leverages our IP, but it also gives us a very key partner in the Chinese market, which we all believe is going to be very, very important for datacenter growth going forward. So, hopefully, I addressed your questions there.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Yeah. And if I might just one quick follow-up. Are you of the view that you just can go and hit the ground running? I guess, you do, because you're expecting a $15 million payment right away, is there like any risk in the regulatory front on this deal? Thank you.","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Mark, we don't expect any risk on the regulatory front. We believe that the technologies that we're licensing are compliant with all of the regulations, the U.S. regulatory issues. And I would also say that the joint venture is starting, and we do believe that we will execute quickly.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Thank you very much.","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from David Wong from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Could you give us some idea \u2013 you called out your sequential growth guidance was in part due to Graphics. Are you able to give us any feel for what sequential growth in Graphics your guidance assumes? And what products are driving the sequential growth? Does this come from Polaris or do Polaris revenues start after the June quarter?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Yes. So, David, our sequential guidance, as we mentioned, is due to both Semi-Custom and Graphics. I would say, it's more heavily weighted on Semi-Custom. But if you look at our Graphics progression over the last couple of quarters, even though Q1 is normally a weaker market than Q4, we grew units overall in the desktop Graphics business. So, we believe that was on some of the strength of some of our new software work and our work with the ecosystem. So, going into the second quarter, again, we believe that we have an opportunity in Graphics to drive some volume. Polaris is on track to launch in the middle of the year. And we will expect that will drive further strength in the second half.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, great. And just a clarification. You mentioned $53 million license gain, but if I understand correctly, your guidance is for $25 million in the second quarter. Is that part of that $53 million or is that something different?","Devinder Kumar - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP","Yeah, David. I can take that. So, the total proceeds in the Q1 timeframe were $57 million, but there are taxes related to that. So the net cash for us was $52 million. We recognize $7 million in Q1 of 2016. We're recognizing $25 million in Q2. And then the rest of it will be over the second half of 2016, which is the balance $20 million.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Devinder Kumar - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Hans Mosesmann from Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. Hey, Lisa, can you give us a sense on Zen \u2013 based on you're hitting all your performance milestones, what part of the server market are you addressing? What's the size of the opportunity? And I'm assuming that you can go after both enterprise and datacenter because it's an x86. Thanks.","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Yes. So, Hans, we are pleased with the progress on Zen. Obviously, there are lots of engineering milestones to pass, but a key one is that we're on track to sample to our priority customers in the second quarter. In terms of the markets that we can address, yes, we do believe that Zen has brought applicability across enterprise and datacenter. And we will continue to work with both OEMs and ODMs to ensure that they have the right boards and platforms for our products.","Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Thanks, Hans.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Joe L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about how the JV is going to be set up over time. Will you compete with them with standard products within China, or is there some kind of dividing of the market? And will they be manufacturing the products with their own foundry relationships or will you be delivering the manufactured product?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Okay. So, Joe, the way to think about it is, the JV roadmap will be a complimentary roadmap to our own server roadmap. So, we think there will be enough differentiation. But taken as a whole, it'll be a compelling roadmap. In terms of foundries, I think we're not ready to talk about foundries, but we'll update more about the products as we get further into the execution.","Joe L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And will the monetization of this over time, I mean, you mentioned that there's a royalty component as well. Will most of the monetization come from the licensing? Or do you think the royalty portion could be of similar size down the road?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","I would say that it's probably a bit early to call that. The licensing payment is well understood. The royalties will come over time depending on the strength of the products and the number of products that are being done.","Joe L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Thanks, Joe.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ian Ing from MKM Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC","Yes. First question on the server JV, your products are going to go up against some deep incumbency in the China server market. So, how advantage do you think this JV will be in terms of perhaps being a locally-sourced product or are there other advantages that this JV would bring to the table to address the incumbency?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","I think, Ian, we believe that there is a large opportunity in the datacenter market across the board. I mean, that's why we're investing so much in Zen, and its follow-ons. As it relates to the China JV that we're doing with THATIC, I think there is certainly a benefit to having someone local that has experience in the market and knowledge of the market. And THATIC is an investment consortium that is partially led by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. So, we think that both from a technical and a commercial standpoint, they will be a value-added partner in this joint venture.","Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC","Thanks. And for my follow-up for your June guidance, you're getting some strength in from this new Semi-Custom ramp. I mean, how sustained should we think that ramp to be? And is it a seasonal ramp? Does it come back every year? Any granularity would help. Thanks.","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Yeah. So, as it relates to our guidance for the second quarter and then the full year, if you think about the Semi-Custom business in the last few years, the third quarter is always the peak, and it will be the peak this year as well. We are starting some of the ramp in the second quarter, as we build up to the stronger third quarter. But overall, I think, we feel good about the Semi-Custom business. The business overall will grow year-on-year as a result of the product momentum we have.","Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC","Okay. Thanks. I'll re-queue.","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is Shankar on behalf of Vivek. I have a question on the gross margin. Given the strong growth in Q2, why isn't the gross margin growing? And longer term, what are the levers behind the gross margin? Can it grow from 32% to 35%, 40%, and what do you have to do to get there?","Devinder Kumar - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP","Yeah. I can take that, Shankar. So, I think if you look at the business, in particular as I said even in my prepared remarks, you have gross margin levers, but one of the things that obviously comes into play is the mix of business between the Semi-Custom business or the EESC business and then the CG business. So that obviously comes in play. As Lisa said, we have the growth with our guidance for revenue in Q2, and it's weighted towards the Semi-Custom business in addition to the growth that we're seeing in Graphics. And that's primarily what's driving the guidance at 31% as compared to where we came in, in Q1, at the 32% level.","And then as far as the levers going out from then, I think it partly is a mix of the business overall from a viewpoint of the Semi-Custom business and other businesses, but also the continuing investment we're making in the roadmaps, as you see from our OpEx guidance for the rest of the year, that we want to go ahead and invest in products, in Graphics and in other areas that will help us improve the gross margin. And then getting into later on when the Zen product is introduced, having even higher gross margin compared to where we are today.","Unknown Speaker","All right. Thanks. As a follow-up on the Semi-Custom side, didn't some Embedded revenue will likely come in, in the second half, like you guided before, $1 billion of total revenue spread over, I think, three years? How much of the second half growth in Semi-Custom comes from Embedded versus Semi-Custom?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Yeah. So maybe let me give you some explanation on that, Shankar. So the Semi-Custom, just to recap on what we've said about the Semi-Custom designs in the past. We have a total of three design wins that have a lifetime revenue of about, let's call it, $1.5 billion or greater. And that will come across over the next three years to four years.","In addition we have our current game console business as well. So when you look at the aggregate of that, we do expect to start ramping that new business in the second half of the year. But we also expect the seasonal uplift of our traditional game console business. So that's adding to what we expect will be a strong year for Semi-Custom overall.","Unknown Speaker","If I can just slip in. The $1.5 billion you said, is that evenly split over the next three years to four years? Or is it ramps towards the end of 2018 or so?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","I mean it takes some time to ramp, right? So this year will be lower, since it's half a year, and it's not all of the designs. And as we go into the next few years, it will ramp to a steady state. So...","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Bernstein Research","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First on the licensing agreement, can you be a little more specific on exactly what you're licensing? You said it was like high performance CPUs and SoCs. Is this x86? Is it ARM? Is it both? And what are the other pieces besides CPUs potentially that you're licensing?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Okay. So, Stacy, what we're licensing is microprocessor technology and system-on-chip technology. So they're technologies, not products. The technologies are applicable to both x86 and ARM. But as you know most of our investments are in x86. And then in terms of other aspects, there are other aspects that are needed to put together a system-on-chip, so they include things like fabrics and other IP.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Bernstein Research","So let me ask the question a different way. Will the JV be able to manufacture and sell x86 based server chips into China?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Yes. The JV will be able to manufacture and sell x86 server chips.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Bernstein Research","Thank you. Thank you. I have one more question for you on IP. Is this JV exclusive? Or would you be free to sign other server-based JVs with other parties, both either inside China or outside of China?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","It is not an exclusive deal.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Bernstein Research","Okay. And one more if I could. Just in your current quarter you launched Bristol Ridge in March. So maybe that led to some of the incremental, like, better than market unit growth. But why were ASPs overall down, given the product refresh that started? And what do you expect for pricing into Q2?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Yeah. So if you talk about the Bristol Ridge launch, we did start the launch in March, including on the mobile side. And that did contribute to some of the mobile units up.","If you look at the overall ASPs, actually mobile ASPs were up, desktop ASPs were down. And that's why we said overall down, but it was quite modest. So if you look overall I think the ASP trends are about what we would expect. Going into the second quarter and in general, I mean it depends on the mix and the mix of the product. We are certainly trying to sell further up the stack. But we'll have to see how the exact mix comes out. But there's not a dramatic change in ASPs, if that's what you're asking.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Bernstein Research","Got it. Thank you.","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Thanks, Stacy.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Bill C. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Hi. This is Bill Peterson calling in for Harlan. Thanks for taking the question. A clarification on the earlier question. You said most of the new growth is coming from Semi-Custom and some from Graphics. Is there any channel fill or related Polaris revenue in the second quarter or planned in the second quarter? Or is it really a second half story?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Again, not being specific, because we haven't actually announced our launch date, but I would say the majority of Polaris is a second half story.","Bill C. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then more of a broader question related to PCs, obviously becoming less important. But what is AMD's view on the PC market in terms of unit shipments this year? And what is the expectation in terms of AMD's growth in that segment, if we think about the full year?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Yeah. So again, on the PC market I think our view of the PC market is very consistent with what's out there, probably down, let's call it, high single digits. Certainly the first quarter started off a bit weaker than any of us would have liked. I would say though in that environment, we still believe that we can gain share in both the client compute and the Graphics side, really as we are transitioning to a new product portfolio on the Graphics side. So I think that's a strong driver for us.","And then on the client compute side, between our product refresh and also our partnership with OEMs, I think in general OEMs are getting more comfortable using us higher up in the stack, and our A8s, our A10s, our commercial-based processors. So we're continuing to work with OEMs to ensure that we get into the right priority platforms. And so that would be our focus even in a down market.","Bill C. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Suji De Silva from Topeka Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Suji De Silva - Topeka Capital Markets","Hi. How you're doing? So, on the arrangement with THATIC, can you talk about what end markets the server product would be specifically targeting? Is it going after government business there, research institutions or maybe the China Internet companies?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","I think it's fair to say that the market range for the joint venture will be across China, so, across all of the markets that you mentioned.","Suji De Silva - Topeka Capital Markets","Can you talk about the pipeline for the licensing business? You instituted, I guess, announced it a couple of quarters ago and you already have a success here. I'm wondering how robust the pipeline might be for further licensing opportunity.","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Yeah. Look, we're thinking about our IP monetization strategy as really a broad strategy that's going to unfold over the next number of years. So, I wouldn't say that these things are all going to be immediate. The IP monetization includes patent licensing, it includes sale of a certain parts of our patent portfolio that are no longer core to our business, as well as the strategic technology licensing. We have a good solid pipeline. I would say, there are lots of opportunities out there. We are looking for ones that are very additive to our product portfolio into our roadmap objectives. And I think we will look for the right partners to enable that.","Suji De Silva - Topeka Capital Markets","One last quick question. Would it be possible to tell us how long you've been in discussions for this licensing agreement? And understand (35:23) how long the lead times are for them to close?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","It's fair to say that any one of these deals takes a while. So, they're fairly involved to go through, but I think we have a good set of conversations. And we certainly believe that there's a lot of value in this IP portfolio that we will continue to leverage.","Suji De Silva - Topeka Capital Markets","I'm sorry by what I mean a while means. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. This is Sidney Ho calling on behalf of Ross. Thanks for taking my question. So, first question is, you talked about EESC revenue will be up annually. And I think you talk about the different components. So just to be clear, do you expect game console revenues specifically to be up? And kind of related to that, do you expect the C&G revenue to be up this year as well?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Okay. So, again, I'd like to keep it at the segment level. And at the segment level, we expect both segments to be up to contribute to our overall guidance of revenue being up. As it relates to our EESC business, the majority of the EESC business is Semi-Custom. So, Semi-Custom would have to be up year-over-year. And then I think that's about as specific as I would like to get.","Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. And my follow-up question is on the discrete GPU market. Your competitor has grown very nicely, by what 35%, in the last two years. Clearly some of that is coming from share gains. I mean, you guys have also gained game share in Q1, seems like. What do you think the Graphics market itself is growing on a normalized basis? And it wasn't that long ago you guys were like 50% share in discrete Graphics, that is, but with the traction you're seeing right now and with Polaris right around the corner, how quickly do you think you can regain share? And which segment do you think has the biggest opportunities?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Yeah. So, look, I think the Graphics business is very strategic to us. And I think it's not just a unit story, it is really also the mix going to higher-end Graphics driven by VR and driven by AAA gaming and all the things going on there.","As it relates to our share, I will say that we certainly have aspirations to regain shares to our historic levels. It will take us some period of time. So, it'll happen over multiple number of quarters. We're optimistic about the second half of the year, and we think Polaris is positioned well. We're particularly positioning in some of the mainstream segments that are higher volumes that would drive share growth faster. And we'll have to see how that plays out in the second half of the year.","Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Christopher Danely from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Unknown Speaker","Good afternoon. This is Marco speaking on behalf of Chris Danely. In light of your IP licensing agreement with THATIC, can you just kind of talk about your expectations for the China server market in 2016 and 2017, and is there any longer term milestone?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Yeah. So, with regard to our China JV with THATIC, we're starting the development phase in 2016. So, I would say that we view this as a longer term opportunity for us. But overall, I think all of the trends in the datacenter market are certainly positive. And we believe we can participate in those trends with both the AMD products as well as the JV products.","Unknown Speaker","Thank you. And then my follow-up regarding your days of inventory. It looks like this quarter is about 110 days. Why is it so high, and if there's any worries?","Devinder Kumar - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP","Hi. I think, if you look at it from a day standpoint, essentially we've managed the inventory pretty well. It's up slightly in Q1, but we also guided the revenue up pretty significantly from where we ended in Q1. And we've also said that second half of the year we're expecting strength over first half, and obviously that leads to higher inventory. And so, Q1 to Q2 up slightly, revenues up. And then we expect second half to be stronger than the first half.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Kevin Cassidy from Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you for taking my question. On the licensing and JV, are there opportunities \u2013 would you consider the mobile market or the desktop market?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","When you say, you mean mobile PCs or mobile other...?","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, mobile PCs.","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","I see. Look, I think, as it relates to the overall licensing strategy, I think we are open to licensing that makes sense. And so, strategically placed with the right market drivers. I don't think we have anything that is necessarily off limits. I will say that it does need to be strategic and additive to our product business. Our first priority is the product business, and the IP monetization effort is an overlay on top of that.","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And what is the timeframe for the JV? I guess, does this license go on through the life of the patents or...","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","It's for a number of years through the product development and sales cycle.","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Nothing specific right now?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","No, nothing specific right now.","Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks. Just on this licensing agreement, obviously when you license it to China, do you think they have the manufacturing process experience to go into production with this? And what's the timeline to get commercial products in the market with this licensing agreement?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Yeah, Vijay. Thanks for your question. Actually, we're not talking about sort of the details of the product timelines just yet. We'd like to really get the JV off and running before we disclose those details, and those will be disclosed as part of the joint venture. As it relates to manufacturing, I think there might be interest in manufacturing in China, although that is certainly not a condition of the deal.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Got it. And as you look at this Semi-Custom ramp, the 15% to 18% very encouraging. How do you split it up between gaming and the new VR strategy, VR market? Obviously, VR seems to be a huge market as you look out. Thanks.","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Yeah. I think the way to think about it is, for the near term, I think the Semi-Custom business and gaming is probably the larger driver. We believe VR is a strategic area where you will see more pickup over the next number of quarters and over the next years, but it's not the near-term driver.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah. Good afternoon guys. Lisa, I guess, my first question, when you look at your full-year guide for revenue to grow, I'm kind of curious to what extent is that based upon sort of market forecast versus market share gains. I know you don't want to get into division by division, but maybe at a high level, as you look at your year-over-year growth, how do you differentiate between what the market's doing and kind of the market share gains that you need to get to that year-over-year growth?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Yeah. That's a fair question, John. So, let me break it up into the two segments. When you look at the EESC segment and especially Semi-Custom, I mean, that's less about a general market and more about what we see in terms of the customer forecasts, and what they're seeing the market to be. So, I think those are, let's call it, fairly well understood by us, and we're very interlocked with our customers.","When you talk about the Computing and Graphics market, I think that's where you get a little bit more of how much uncertainty is there with the PC market trends. There's no question that the PC market is weaker than any of us would like. I think from our standpoint, though, if you remember the last few quarters and how many times we've talked about inventory normalization and ensuring that we got ourselves into a healthy position relative to our OEM and channel customers, I think we feel that we've done a good job there. And we're now in a place where the consumption is more in line with the selling.","So we believe that even in this market, there's enough opportunity for us to gain share. And obviously we have to prove that out over the next couple of quarters. But just given where our business is, where we see the products, and where we see the design wins, that's how we see the market right now.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah. And then, Lisa, I apologize if you addressed this, but just going back to the JV in China. I'm just kind of curious. The IP licensing gains you expected this year, are there any milestones that you need to hit to get that? And as we think about 2017, if you hit the milestones in 2017, would we expect licensing to grow year over year from the JV?","And then lastly on the JV, just given that you guys have the opportunity to go into China today and sell your own product, I'm just kind of curious how we should think about $100 of server product in the JV? And what that means to you from an economic standpoint? Versus you just going into China today and selling $100 worth of server product as AMD.","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Yeah. No. Good question. So, look, on the JV licensing payments, so we will expect about half of the licensing revenue to come over the next two years, so over 2016 and 2017. Our current forecast for 2016 was that $50 million-ish that Devinder mentioned. And it is contingent on several milestones that we believe are on track.","To your broader question about why do a JV? And versus just selling right into servers? Look, we're very cognizant of where our share is in servers. So I believe we have the technology to get there. And we will continue to make progress.","But given the importance of China, and the fact that having a partner who is very much familiar with both the Chinese market from a customer as well as just a technology standpoint, I think can only be additive. And there's more than enough server market to go after, given where we are. So I think it's an additive deal to our baseline strategy.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks, guys.","Ruth Cotter - Chief Human Resources Officer and Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications, Investor Relations","Operator, we'll take two more callers, please.","Operator","Certainly. Our next question is coming from Deepon Nag from Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.","Deepon Nag - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, guys. So, Lisa, for the Semi-Custom wins that you're going to get in the back half of the year, are those going to be purely incremental to existing products? Or is there any risk of cannibalization to existing products?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Yeah. I don't believe that we've gone through any detail about what those wins are. So I would prefer to let that come out as our customers are ready to launch.","Deepon Nag - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thanks for that. And then on the game console side, so clearly VR is going to be a pretty big deal in Q4 with Sony PS4 VR. And there's been some chatter about obviously maybe a faster refresh for some of the game consoles. Because the value of Graphics is becoming higher in these game consoles, is there any potential for you to get higher content and more specifically higher margins in future console refreshes? And is there also any ability to renegotiate terms if \u2013 because of the value of your IP is getting more valuable inside these consoles?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","So let me take that in several pieces. Relative to our current game consoles, those deals were well negotiated at the beginning. And I don't think we will be renegotiating. I think the ASPs and all that stuff are also well understood.","Relative to what VR brings \u2013 and again not being specific to any particular customer, because there's just a lot of speculation out there in the industry. I will say that VR is very exciting not just for game consoles, but for PC gaming, for the headset guys, for the ecosystem. So yes. We believe that Graphics becomes much more valuable in this framework. And we will be looking for how to leverage and monetize that across both our Semi-Custom business as well as our discrete Graphics and APU businesses.","Deepon Nag - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","And just one quick clarification if I could squeeze it in. So for any future console refreshes though, you do have the ability to reset ASP terms? Or is it already pre-negotiated in your initial contracts?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Well, I think if anybody were to do a different console or a new console, then that would be a new negotiation. But for the current generation consoles, those terms are locked.","Deepon Nag - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Jaguar Bajwa from Arete Research. Please proceed with your question.","Jaguar Bajwa - Arete Research Services LLP","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just on the Polaris launch in midyear, you talked about attacking the mainstream segment of the GPU market. I just wonder when you look at potential share gains in the second half, do you expect that to come more from the discrete desktop side in the AIB channel or the notebook space, where you have a relatively higher share, market share?","And given your ASPs in that space, roughly in the discrete desktop spaces, I think you've got about a third of the ASP of your competitor. Just wondering on the trend of that? And how you see that over the second half of the year?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Yeah. So we believe that we have a share gain opportunity in both mobile and desktop\/AIB as we look at Polaris and how it will launch in the second half of the year.","Relative to the ASP trends, I think that depends a bit on the mix of the business. So I think I'll defer that to how things look. But from a macro standpoint we believe we can get a larger revenue share in discrete Graphics, but we'll certainly have to look at how the individual quarters shape up.","Jaguar Bajwa - Arete Research Services LLP","Okay. And then also, given your IP licensing deal in China, I'm just wondering on the acceleration side for GPU, I mean, do you see opportunity there potentially with that deal? And also, just on a more general sense, we hear a lot about acceleration with GPU. Can you just talk about how you're approaching that kind of acceleration in general? I mean, will Polaris be suited to that? Or we have to wait for Vega to come out later in the year? And how do you differentiate versus your competitors?","Lisa T. Su - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director","Yeah. So, in terms of your first question on GPU acceleration, so, the JV that we announced with THATIC is focused on microprocessor technologies only. So, it doesn't cover Graphics.","And then to your comment about Graphics acceleration or just in general becoming more important and a growth driver, we would agree with that. I think going forward, you'll see a bit more focus from us in that area. We have launched some new professional graphics products recently. We've also introduced this new software initiative called GPUOpen that really focuses on building an open ecosystem around the Graphics area, both in compute and gaming. And so, we do believe it's a good opportunity and an area that we will invest more.","Jaguar Bajwa - Arete Research Services LLP","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you.","Ruth Cotter - Chief Human Resources Officer and Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications, Investor Relations","Operator that concludes today's call if you'd like to wrap it up, please.

You'll also find detailed discussions about our risk factors and our filings with the SEC and in particular, AMD's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 25, 2016.","Now, with that, I'd like to hand the call over to Lisa. Lisa?","Lisa Su","Thank you, Ruth and good afternoon to all those listening in today. Our strong third quarter results highlight the progress we have made across AMD this past year as we improve our financial performance by delivering great products. Third quarter revenue of $1.3 billion increased 27% sequentially and 23% from the year ago period. Driven by upside demand for our graphics products and record semi custom sales.","In addition to the significant revenue growth, we also achieved several financial and operational milestones in the quarter. We strengthened our balance sheet and improved our P&L through a series of capital markets transactions that reprofiled and reduced our debt.","We also signed a strategic amendment to our Wafer Supply Agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES that provide sourcing flexibility and financial predictability. Most importantly we delivered non-GAAP net income in the quarter, based on strong execution of our product road map and growing momentum across our business.","Looking at our Computing and Graphics segment, we had solid growth in the quarter. Revenue increased 9% sequentially and 11% from the year ago period driven by improved sales of mobile APUs and discrete GPUs. Mobile processor revenue and unit shipments increased for the fourth straight quarter as seventh generation APU shipments continued ramping, highlighted by the launch of our new PRO series APUs earlier this month with HP.","Customer and partner excitement for our Zen based desktop product Summit Ridge is growing as we successfully passed several key engineering and design win milestones in the quarter. We provided our first competitive performance preview of Summit Ridge in the quarter and believe we will have a very competitive offering for the $4 billion high performance desktop processor market.","We are working closely with our infrastructure partners and customers in preparation for the launch in early 2017. In graphics, we had a very strong quarter with discrete GPU revenue and unit shipments growing by double-digit percentages sequentially and year-over-year.","The launch of our expanded family of Polaris desktop GPUs and our first full quarter of RX 480 sales drove our highest quarterly channel GPU revenue and ASP since early 2014. Radeon RX GPUs now account for more than 50% of our channel GPU revenue. Polaris GPU\u2019s continue to gain traction based on their leadership performance in VR and on the rapidly expanding number of software titles that feature the latest generation of API\u2019s like DirectX 12 and Vulkan.","Our progress in the quarter was punctuated by Oculus, announcing a limited edition Oculus-ready PC, powered by an AMD FX processor and Radeon RX 470 GPU. That brings the cost of entry for VR ready system down to $500 for the first time. This is a meaningful milestone for consumers and I am excited that AMD is enabling the ecosystem and driving broader adoption of the VR by making premium experiences available at such an attractive price point. We also delivered our fourth straight quarter of sequential revenue growth for our professional graphics products. In addition to solid workstation sales growth, we expanded our presence in the server GPU market, as HP announced availability of multiple Radeon options across their traditional and blade server offering. ","And just last week, we announced the collaboration with Alibaba cloud, China's largest cloud provider, to deploy Radeon PRO server GPUs across their data centers to expand the scale and services of their global cloud offering. We now have material server GPU engagements with multiple cloud datacenter providers, demonstrating that our strategy to grow our presence in this profitable market by delivering superior performance with Radeon PRO hardware in conjunction with industry standard programming tools and API\u2019s is beginning to pay-off. ","Now turning to our enterprise embedded and semi custom segment. Revenue increased 41% sequentially and 31% from the year- ago period, driven by record semi custom sales, which included the ramp of three new FinFET-based products the Xbox One S updated PlayStation 4, and our new design win in the Sony PlayStation 4 Pro. We are on track to grow semi custom unit shipments and revenue for the third straight year, demonstrating our leadership in high performance gaming technologies for the very successful game console market. ","We expect fourth-quarter revenue to be down seasonally, as we transition from our annual semi custom sales peak in the third quarter. Our embedded product sales grew sequentially, as our newer design wins reach production. In server our Zen based high performance processor remains on track for introduction in the first half of 2017. ","We successfully passed several silicon and platform technical milestones in the quarter, and have secured multiple new designs across OEM, enterprise and cloud providers. In closing as I complete my second year as CEO of AMD, I am pleased with the solid progress we have made across the Company on multiple operational, product, and financial fronts. We are executing our long-term strategy, and a set of near term priorities that I believe provide AMD with significant opportunities over the next 18 to 24 months, to drive top line revenue growth, operating margin expansion, and free cash flow generation. ","We have strengthened the core of the Company, by clearly defining the markets where we have technology and expertise to win; bringing a laser focus to our product execution around our graphics and microprocessor road map; creating deeper more lasting relationships with strategic customers, monetizing our assets and valuable IP with two joint ventures in China and re-engineering our balance sheet to increase our cash balance and reduce debt. ","I want to thank the thousands of AMDers whose determination this past year has allowed us to put in place the financial and operational foundation to drive growth and profitability. In 2017, with Zen and Vega, we are focused on delivering our strongest product portfolio in over a decade, capable of unlocking multiple growth pillars for our business across the data center, gaming, and high performance graphics and PC markets. I am proud of what we have accomplished, and I believe that the best is yet to come.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Devinder, to provide some additional color on our third-quarter financial performance.","Devinder Kumar","Thank you, Lisa, and a very good afternoon to everyone. In the third quarter, we achieved another milestone in our progress as we return to non-GAAP net income profitability. The third quarter financial performance was driven by strong demand for our semi custom SoCs, higher graphics revenue, and positive free cash flow. We executed a series of capital markets transactions that have significantly improved our balance sheet, and turned that profile, and will reduce interest expense beginning in Q4. We also finalized a long-term strategic Wafer Supply Agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES.","Third-quarter revenue was $1.3 billion, up 27% sequentially, driven by higher sales of our record semi custom SoCs and higher graphics processor sales. The year-over-year revenue increased 23%, driven by higher sales of our semi custom SoCs, client mobile processors, and graphics processors. Non-GAAP gross margin was 31%, flat from the prior quarter, driven by a richer mix of PC and graphics products, offsetting lower margin semi custom product.","Non-GAAP operating expenses were $353 million, up $11 million from the prior quarter, due to increased R&D investment. We recognized $24 million of net licensing gains, associated with our server JV with THATIC. Non-GAAP operating income was $70 million this quarter, up $67 million from the prior quarter. Third quarter other net expense was $63 million, mostly consisting of a $61 million loss related to debt retirement. The equity loss in the ATMP JV was $5 million based on our 15% JV ownership stake.","Non-GAAP net income was $27 million, with earnings per share of $0.03. Non-GAAP EPS was calculated using 865 million diluted shares of common stock, which includes 12 million shares associated with the equity offering that closed late in the third quarter. Included in our GAAP operating loss and GAAP net loss is a $340 million charge associated with our Sixth Amendment to the WSA with GLOBALFOUNDRIES. Adjusted EBITDA was $103 million, compared to $36 million in the prior quarter.","Now, turning to the business segments. Computing and Graphics revenue was $472 million, up 9% from the prior quarter, and up 11% year-over-year, primarily due to increased sales of GPUs and client mobile APUs. Computing and Graphics segment operating loss was $66 million, compared to $81 million the prior quarter, primarily due to higher revenue. Enterprise embedded and semi custom revenue was $835 million, up 41% from the prior quarter, and 31% higher year-over-year, driven by higher semi custom SoC sales. Operating income of this segment was $136 million, up from $84 million in the prior quarter, primarily driven by higher revenue.","Turning to the balance sheet, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.3 billion at the end of the quarter, up $301 million from the end of the prior quarter, including $274 million remaining from the proceeds of our capital market transaction. Excluding this amount, the cash was $984 million, as compared to $957 million last quarter. Free cash flow was a positive $20 million in the third quarter. Inventory was $772 million, up $29 million or 4% from the end of the prior quarter, in support of holiday season GPU and semi custom product sales expectations in the first part of the fourth quarter.","Total wafer purchases from GLOBALFOUNDRIES in third quarter were $168 million, and we continue to expect overall wafer purchases of approximately $650 million in 2016, including $155 million purchased in early 2016, as part of the Fifth Amendment to the WSA. Debt as of the end of the quarter was $1.6 billion, down from the prior quarter, due to our significant debt reduction effort.","During the third quarter, we raised approximately $1.4 billion in cash, as a result of issuing $690 million of common stock, which includes the exercise of an underwriter\u2019s option to purchase 15% or $90 million of additional common stock, and the issuance of $700 million in two and one eight percent convertible notes due in 2026. We used the majority of these funds to redeem outstanding term debt through cash tender offers, and we paid off the outstanding ABL balance of $226 million.","In addition, early in the fourth quarter, another $105 million of convertible notes were issued as part of the exercise of an underwriter\u2019s option, bringing the total principal amount of the 2026 convertible notes to $805 million. We also redeemed the remaining principal debt balance of $208 million of the 2020 senior note, which was our most expensive debt. This debt has now been fully paid off. The debt reductions and issuance of the new convertible notes due 2026 that occur in the third quarter and early in the fourth quarter will result in approximately $55 million of annualized cash interest savings, beginning in the fourth quarter.","Please refer to today\u2019s CFO written commentary for further details of the capital markets transactions and debt on the balance sheet. Free cash flow in the third quarter was a positive $20 million, compared to a negative $106 million in the second quarter of 2016, primarily due to increased revenue, improvements in working capital, and a reduction in capital expenditures. ","Now turning to our fourth quarter 2016 outlook, a 14 fiscal week quarter, as it has an extra week. We expect revenue to decrease 18% sequentially, plus or minus 3%, primarily driven by a seasonal decline in our semi custom business, and an improvement in our CG business. Revenue at the midpoint of guidance would be up 12% year-over-year. Non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 32%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $350 million. IP monetization licensing gain to be approximately $25 million. To maintain non-GAAP operating profitability, non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $32 million. Cash and cash equivalents to be up, in line with our guidance of ending 2016 with positive free cash flow, excluding cash from capital market transactions, and the net proceeds from the ATMP JV.","Inventory to be down to approximately $660 million. Basic share count to be approximately 930 million, including 115 million shares related to the third quarter equity issuance. And we now expect full year revenue growth to be up approximately 6% from 2015, based on the midpoint of fourth quarter revenue guidance.","In closing, we are very pleased with the progress we made in the third quarter. With focused execution, we continue to build a solid financial foundation for the Company. In just the last three months alone, we achieved non-GAAP net income profitability, amended the WSA with GLOBALFOUNDRIES across multiple years, and deleveraged and derisked the balance sheet with our capital market transaction, such that over the next five years, there is less than $200 million of term debt due. We look forward to continued execution, and further improving our financial performance.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Ruth. Ruth? ","Ruth Cotter","Thank you, Devinder. Operator, we would be pleased to pull the audience for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Certainly. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Matt Ramsay from Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.","Matt Ramsay","Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Obviously a lot has gone on in the last quarter. I figured I would ask a couple things about Zen, since that\u2019s been one of the things that\u2019s most topical, in my conversations with investors. Lisa, you talked about in your prepared remarks, there are multiple OEM engagements and design wins for desktop, and also the same on server. Maybe you could do a little bit to expand upon those? I guess the timing of launch of each, and in particular in the server market, the focus, whether that be enterprise, or whether that be cloud-based. Thank you.","Lisa Su","Absolutely, Matt. Thanks for your question, and as you said, it\u2019s been a very busy quarter for us. As it relates to Zen, we are on track to launch in the first half of the year, for both our desktops and our servers. The desktop launch will go first, and it is on track for the first quarter, and then the server launch will go in the second quarter. We\u2019ve had a wide amount of sampling that\u2019s gone on in the third quarter. We have multiple customers on both the PC side, as well as the server side, who have working hardware now in their labs. They\u2019re bringing up their platforms and software, and we\u2019re very pleased with how smoothly it\u2019s coming up, actually.","So you asked specifically about the server side. Our focus on servers is really across the OEM business, including enterprise, as well as the cloud data centers. And I think the key for us is we\u2019re getting a lot of interest from our partners, and we continue to work with them to bring up their systems. But I think we are optimistic about where we are in the Zen bring-up, and the Zen launch cycle.","Matt Ramsay","Thank you for that. That\u2019s helpful. And then I guess as a follow-up there, in the server market, I think obviously your GPU primary competitor has had some very stellar traction with server acceleration around GPUs, and you highlighted in the prepared remarks some wins and engagements that you\u2019ve had on Polaris, and I assume on Vega for server acceleration. Maybe you could expand upon that commentary a bit, what you\u2019re investing there, how the GPUOpen, or the OpenCL Environment is developing relative to the CUDA environment in server acceleration, and just what proportion of your GPU business could be driven by that server opportunity in the long-term? Any commentary that would be great. Thanks.","Lisa Su","Yes. So let\u2019s talk overall about our graphics business. So when you look at our graphics business, certainly we\u2019re very pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve made on the consumer side, with Polaris. But we\u2019ve also mentioned that we\u2019ve made good progress on the professional graphics side, including both workstations, as well as server GPUs. I think the market is certainly very receptive to growth in the server GPU area. I was just at the Alibaba Cloud computing conference last week, where we announced our collaboration with them. They\u2019re actually using parts that are pre-Polaris and pre-Vega.","So we were demoing a GPU-based cloud server based on some of our FirePro technology, using hardware-based virtualization. And I think the main feedback that we\u2019ve gotten from them, as well as multiple other cloud engagements, is the hardware looks very good. We\u2019re working with them on the overall infrastructure and software to bring that up, and we believe that the products are very competitive in this market. And the market is nice because it\u2019s certainly margin accretive, to the consumer side of the business.","So we do expect as we bring out Vega in the first half of 2017 that will certainly strengthen the product portfolio. But there\u2019s a lot of interest in the cloud space around what we\u2019re doing with Radeon PRO and on the server GPU side.","Matt Ramsay","Thank you very much. I\u2019ll get back in queue. Appreciate it.","Lisa Su","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Perhaps your phone is on mute. Mr. Seymore, please unmute your phone. Mr. Seymore your line is online, please pick up your handset if your phone is on mute.","Lisa Su","We can go to the next caller, operator. Thank you.","Operator","Certainly, our next question is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Lipacis","Thanks for taking my questions. I had two questions. First one, on the Alibaba deal, so this is not a new set of products you\u2019re developing, its products you already have. And can you talk about, to the extent this is like a cloud services offering versus deep learning applications, that they might be doing with your products? And I guess when I think about the architecture, I normally think about having an X86 processor sitting next to the GPU. I was wondering is it logical to assume that Zen is the natural X86 pairing with your GPUs in the Alibaba deployments?","Lisa Su","Sure, Mark. So again, I think on the Alibaba deployment, it is the beginning of what we expect to be a long-term collaboration. So the work today is being done on a pre-Polaris base, but we do expect that will upgrade as we go forward. I think the key is, there are many, many applications, but what we\u2019re starting from is a GPU base cloud server application, so in virtualized environments, you can imagine cloud gaming or remote workstation-type environments which need a lot of graphics horsepower, as well as virtual desktop environments.","And I think as we go forward, certainly, we view the opportunity to expand that into a broader set of workloads, as well as obviously on the CPU side as well. We think the cloud is a very important market for us to focus on, on both the GPU and the CPU side, and we\u2019re ramping up our efforts there.","Mark Lipacis","Great. A follow-up if I may. Last night Tesla announced that it was using NVIDIA for their self-driving car, but on the conference call Elon Musk, I think the expression he used, was that it was a tight decision between NVIDIA and AMD, which suggests that you\u2019re further along in solutions for deep learning and neural networking than most, including myself, thought. And so I was wondering, can you talk about your efforts in deep learning and artificial intelligence, how big is that business now? Do you have anything in that business now? And how do you grow that, going forward? Thank you.","Lisa Su","Sure, Mark. So look, there is a lot of interest in the deep learning space overall, and certainly our GPUs are very applicable to that space. So when we look at competitiveness and all that stuff, we think we can be very competitive there. We will be talking more about our strategy in the coming quarters, so maybe let me refer to that, Mark. But I think suffice it to say, I think we\u2019ve looked at GPUs as overall secular growth, whether you\u2019re talking about consumer, professional workstations, server GPUs, or any of this machine learning area. So we\u2019re going to continue to invest and lean in, in those areas.","Mark Lipacis","Thank you.","Lisa Su","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","John Pitzer","Yes, good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask in the call. Lisa, Devinder, nice job on the quarter. I guess, Devinder first. Just going to the December quarter guidance, you\u2019re characterizing it as seasonal. I know the trappings of talking about normal seasonal, because there\u2019s so much variance around it, but it does seem like in prior quarters, where you had a 14th week, that extra week actually did help revenue a little bit. I\u2019m just kind of curious within the context of the December quarter guidance, how you\u2019re thinking about that extra week, both on the revenue line and on expenses.","Devinder Kumar","I think if you look at a 14-week quarter, I think, John, you\u2019re right, it depends upon many factors. Our 14-week quarter is in the Q4 time frame, which is this quarter we are in. On the revenue side, I would say looking at it overall, there\u2019s not much of an impact, as the extra week falls during the holiday season, when a large portion of our operations and our customers are in shutdown mode. There is an impact on the expense side, but that\u2019s already contemplated within the guidance of OpEx that I gave, the $350 million due to the extra week.","John Pitzer","That\u2019s helpful. And then Lisa, a little bit longer-term. Over the last several quarters, you\u2019ve been somewhat forced to try to manage profitability levels to that breakeven line, given the lack of revenue growth. But now that you\u2019re on this path of more sustainable revenue growth, I\u2019m just curious as you think about R&D specifically, how should we think about your desire to want to invest in higher rates, as revenue begins to grow from these levels? Because clearly, as Mark talked about on the last question, you\u2019ve got a lot of potential new areas and opportunities to go after. Can you give us a sense as to what \u2013 to what degree you think you\u2019ve been under-investing in R&D and how we should think about R&D investments over the next several quarters, as revenue growth kind of resumes?","Lisa Su","Yes, absolutely, John. I think it\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019ve been very prudent in how we\u2019ve invested overall. If you look at our operating expenses, 2016 to 2015, although we\u2019ve been relatively flat overall, we\u2019ve actually increased R&D, relative to other elements of the P&L. But as we see revenue growth and as we\u2019ve seen progress over the last couple of quarters, I think you\u2019ve also seen us increase our R&D spend. I think there are several areas that we see as very large opportunities, and we talked about some of the graphics areas in the previous question with Mark.","I also think in the data center, there\u2019s a large opportunity for us on the CPU side, as Zen fully comes to market. So I think we have an opportunity to invest a bit more in R&D as our revenue grows, but we\u2019re still going to be very prudent with how we do that. I think the key metric there in terms of being net income profitable this quarter, ensuring that we get free cash flow positive from operations for the full year, those are all important metrics for us, and we\u2019re going to continue to manage very diligently.","John Pitzer","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you guys. Congratulations.","Lisa Su","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from David Wong from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","David Wong","Thanks very much. Do you expect GPU sales will grow sequentially in the December quarter, and what about computing revenues?","Lisa Su","Yes, so David, I think we would expect overall that the CG business or the Computing and Graphics business will grow in Q4. The EESC business will be down. And then within the Computing and Graphics business, I would expect growth on both the graphics, as well as the computing side.","David Wong","Great. And do you have any new semi custom wins you can tell us about, or at least give us some idea as to what the momentum is in the pipeline?","Lisa Su","Yes, I think on the semi custom side, David, I will say that we previously announced three, and that\u2019s the number that we\u2019ll talk about today. Two of them are now known, and they\u2019re both in the game console area, one is outside of game console. I will say that we have some very good active discussions on future products and applications, and we\u2019ll update more as we get further along.","David Wong","Great, thanks.","Lisa Su","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Hemmelgarn","Thanks very much. And this is Chris Hemmelgarn on for Blayne. With Summit Ridge launching in Q1 of 2017, how would you expect the channel to ramp that? Do you see it ramping pretty fully in the first couple of quarters of the year, or are you looking for more normal PC seasonality?","Lisa Su","No, I would expect that there will be a relatively good initial demand for Summit Ridge that may be not quite at the seasonal patterns. From where we see, Summit Ridge is playing in a space in the high-end desktop, that we currently aren\u2019t offering a product. So we believe we\u2019ll be competitive certainly with Core I5 as well as Core I7, and we will be launching in those areas.","Chris Hemmelgarn","Thanks very much. I guess then looking at the GPU side of things, you guys saw some pretty nice share gains in the first half of this year with the legacy portfolio. Any metrics you can give to help frame how the business did in the first full quarter with Polaris? And any further color you can provide on how you see the share situation progressing into the year-end.","Lisa Su","We\u2019re very happy with how Polaris ramped in Q3. The customer demand across all geographies was very strong. Q3 was primarily a channel-based quarter. With our Add-in-Board, and as some of you noted, in the early part of Q3, we actually had some supply constraints, given the customer demand. We did catch up towards the end of the quarter. So very pleased with how that\u2019s ramped. I think it\u2019s a very competitive market. We\u2019ve leaned into VR, and we\u2019ve leaned into our work with CX12 and I think you can see in some of the benchmarks that we\u2019re doing very well there. As we go into Q4, in addition to the channel partners continuing to ramp, you should expect some OEMs launching in Q4 more broadly. And so Polaris is off to a very strong start.","Chris Hemmelgarn","Thanks very much, Lisa, and congrats on the strong quarter.","Lisa Su","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.","Stacy Rasgon","Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. I first wanted to ask about the second sourcing ability embedded in the new Wafer Supply Agreement. So you\u2019ve said that you\u2019re going to be doing some second sourcing, starting in 2017. I wonder, did that push to actually seek out that supply diversification come from you, or was it from specific requests from your customers? And given that, how do you guys make the decision on which products to manufacture at GLOBALFOUNDRIES versus manufacture somewhere else?","Lisa Su","Sure, Stacy. Let me start with that. I think, relative to our second sourcing or our supply sourcing flexibility, I think we make it on a product-by-product basis, based on where we are in the business. So we will have multiple products in 14-nanometer and 16-nanometer that will be sourced across foundries, and similarly when we talked about the Wafer Supply Agreement, we mentioned 7-nanometer as being a key target node for that. Relative to how we make the decisions, I think it\u2019s a combination of factors. It includes the complexity of the product. It includes the timing, customers, all kinds of things. So I think that\u2019s part of our product planning process.","Stacy Rasgon","Got it. But did the customers themselves have a hand in driving you to make that push to second source?","Lisa Su","I think that\u2019s one element, but frankly, I think what\u2019s more important to me is, I need to commit a strong, five-year product road map to the customers, and so we want to make sure that we have all the flexibility to ensure nothing happens. I\u2019ll give you just a little bit of context, Stacy, because I think you know our business well. In this past six months, we\u2019ve ramped five new FinFET products. I mean it\u2019s the fastest transition we have ever made in a process node, and it\u2019s gone really, really well. And I think what\u2019s helped us with that is the fact that we\u2019ve had two sources ramping at the same time.","Stacy Rasgon","Got it. For my follow-up, I just want to get some clarification on the timing of the Summit Ridge and Zen launches. You said Summit Ridge launches obviously in Q1 2017. You had said before that you were going to be shipping at least some product in Q4 of this year. Is that still true? And around the server launch in Q2, does that mean the volume is actually in Q3?","Lisa Su","So I think our expectation is, we may ship some production samples in Q4, but the volume launch for desktop will be in Q1, and that\u2019s consistent with everything that we\u2019ve planned into the business. And as it relates to server, I think it\u2019s a little early to tell. I think we\u2019ll go through our process, and our customers\u2019 processes, and we\u2019ll have more color on that, as we get into next year.","Stacy Rasgon","Got it. Thank you.","Lisa Su","Thanks, Stacy.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Kunal Patel","Hi, this is Kunal Patel for Ambrish. Thanks for taking my question. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned semi custom\u2019s decline and computing graphics to be up. Implies you\u2019ll have a pretty rich mix for Q4. Why is GM guided up only 1% given the really strong mix for 4Q?","Devinder Kumar","If you look at it from an overall standpoint, let\u2019s talk about Q2 to Q3, first of all. Q2 to Q3, we had a significant ramp in the semi custom space, which led to significant revenue in the EESC side, and we were able to manage the margin flat quarter-on-quarter which we are pleased with. Going to Q4, essentially with the Computing and Graphics business, that\u2019s what Lisa said ramping, and then EESC business, in particular semi custom coming down. The gross margin is up a percentage point, primarily due to the mix in revenue between the two segments.","Kunal Patel","Okay. And for a follow-up, a question on the cash balance. Looked like you\u2019re guiding cash to be up in 4Q, and looks like you have some excess cash after the transactions you\u2019ve done in the quarter, and looks like you might be up over your $1 billion target balance. How do you plan on using the excess cash, or where would you reinvest that cash?","Devinder Kumar","I think right now, as you observe, it\u2019s through at the end of Q3 we did have some remaining net proceeds from the capital market transactions. After completing what we did in the early part of Q4, we have about $162 million of remaining net proceeds. What we plan to do with it, I think from a long-term strategy, that hasn\u2019t changed. Our plan is to continue to delever the balance sheet, reduce debt towards our longer-term targets of getting to the net debt cash neutral that I talked about previously, and getting the leverage ratio down to about 2 times from a longer term standpoint.","Ruth Cotter","Operator, we\u2019ll take two more questions, please.","Operator","Certainly. Our next question is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Joe Moore","Great, thank you. Lisa, you talked about a $4 billion performance desktop opportunity. What\u2019s your thinking in terms of what you can eventually attain of that, just how are you thinking about your potential for market share? And can you give us some sense for, when you have a chip like this, you have enthusiasm about, how quickly it can ramp into that segment? Thank you.","Lisa Su","Yes. So I think if you look at our PC market share, as it\u2019s published by Mercury or so, we\u2019re talking about somewhere around 10%, plus or minus. I think we view that historically we\u2019ve been higher than that in the PC market, and certainly the desktop market, especially the desktop channel market. We\u2019re fairly well-known by that customer set. So we\u2019re enthusiastic about Summit. We think the performance is right on the mark with what we wanted to achieve. And we\u2019re hopeful that as we launch into the first quarter, that there will be a good, solid ramp in that business.","Joe Moore","Okay. Great. And then, how are you thinking about as you think about bringing that chip to market, when will you make it available for third party benchmarks and sort of get a broader marketing program beyond the launch that you\u2019ve done? [indiscernible] before that.","Lisa Su","Yes. I would expect certainly there are a lot of confidential benchmarks at the moment, but in terms of third party benchmarks, you would expect that in the first quarter.","Joe Moore","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Chris Rolland from Susquehanna Financial Group. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Rolland","Hi, guys. Congrats on a great quarter, and nice to see it all coming together. We don\u2019t have September sell-through data yet. It\u2019s kind of hard to predict holiday season, what it\u2019s going to look like for consoles. Perhaps the past two quarters\u2019 growth in EESC might be outpacing expectations for consoles. So my question is, first of all, is that right? Is there something that\u2019s helping your guy\u2019s units here, like initial channel stocking for the PS4 Slim or the PS4 Pro? And how should we think about the size of the benefit that you\u2019re going to get from initial channel stocking there?","Lisa Su","So, Chris, I think the game console shouldn\u2019t be really looked at on a quarterly level, when you\u2019re looking at sell-in and sell-out. It\u2019s so different from the other markets. I would say on an annual basis, everything trues up. The thought process is, in Q2 and Q3, there is a bit of build ahead as the customers are really building for the holiday season. And the customers do so much of their business in the last six weeks of the year. That\u2019s when all of the inventory is drained. My view is that if you look on an annual basis, the game console business is doing quite well. So we expect units to be up. We expect revenue for the business to be up for us, and the quarterly transitions are less important. It\u2019s more, we want to ensure that we\u2019re meeting our customers\u2019 build cycles, so that they get to build everything that they want, and get it into their channels. But from my standpoint, I think it\u2019s a very well-managed system.","Chris Rolland","Great. Congrats on a great quarter.","Lisa Su","Thanks, Chris.","Ruth Cotter","Operator, that concludes today\u2019s call. If you could wrap it up, please, that would be great.","Operator","Certainly.

Rory?","Rory ReadThank you, Ruth. We made progress in the fourth quarter delivering on our commitments, managing expense and cash, and beginning to transform AMD for long term growth and profitability. However, full year results fell short of our expectation, as the challenging macro-environment resulted in a weaker than expected PC market.As I mentioned on our last earnings call, we are executing a turnaround that will take several quarters. We expect continued choppiness in the PC market in the first half of 2013, and we will closely manage the business as we reset, restructure, and ultimately transform AMD.We have the right strategy and a new set of products coming to market in 2013. We continue to make the investments required to drive a larger percentage of our revenue in the high-growth adjacent markets: dense server, semicustom, embedded, and ultra-low power client markets.We are implementing three phases of our turnaround. First, complete the restructuring of our business. This is a critical step in reducing our operating cost model to enable a return to profitability. Second, accelerate our business in 2013 by executing the delivery and launch of a new set of powerful product offerings. And third, transform AMD to take advantage of high-growth opportunities in adjacent markets where our IP provides a competitive advantage.As with any turnaround, it is critical we meet our commitments throughout each step. To that end, we effectively managed our costs, reduced our inventory, and maintained our cash above our minimum acceptable levels in the fourth quarter. Revenue of $1.55 billion met our guidance, while decreasing 9% sequentially and by 32% from a year ago.For the second year in a row, we had a successful Black Friday as sales of AMD-based notebooks in North American retail grew from a year ago. As a result, nearly one in every three notebooks sold in U.S. retail in the fourth quarter were powered by AMD. \u00a0We also saw a sequential increase in desktop microprocessor ASP based on strong channel adoption of our new Athlon FX CPU and A-Series APUs in the quarter. The value proposition of our latest processors drove demand and helped reduce channel inventory. Customers continued to embrace the differentiated value proposition of our APUs.We added Visio as a new customer based on the industry-leading graphics performance and long battery life of AMD\u2019s APUs. Visio\u2019s first AMD-based products will include two touch-based ultrathin and a Windows 8 tablet.Now turning to our server business, we recorded significant revenue growth for our SeaMicro dense servers, driven by large-scale cloud data center wins. SeaMicro solutions are being deployed and evaluated by a broad variety of marquee customers, demonstrating the value of our investment in dense server and setting the stage for continued future growth.Our graphics business performed well in the quarter as well, highlighted by record workstation and gaming revenue and the launch of the Nintendo Wii U game system powered by AMD graphics technology.To help accelerate desktop GPU sales in the channel and reinforce our long term strategy to be a leader in gaming, we launched the \u201cNever Settle\u201d campaign in the quarter. This promotion was well-received by partners and consumers, as we bundled some of the season\u2019s hottest games with our highest-performing graphics cards.In the channel, unit shipments and revenue for our high-end Radeon graphics grew, driving a richer mix and increased ASP from the previous quarter.","We will launch a follow-on promotion this quarter pairing our highest performing graphics cards with some of the most anticipated game titles of 2013.","Now I want to return to the trends impacting AMD and the industry overall and the steps we are taking to restructure, accelerate and, ultimately, transform our business.  We are well on our way toward implementing a new operating model that will allow us to achieve lower operating expense and enable a return to profitability.","In addition, the new products that will accelerate our business in 2013 have passed several key milestones in the quarter as we began shipping Richland and secured solid design wins for the Brazos follow-on Kabini and our new ultra low power Temash APU.","Both Kabini and Temash are currently going through final internal validation in parallel with customer evaluations in anticipation of launches that are planned for the first half of this year.","AMD\u2019s first mobile GPU is based on our graphics core next architecture also began shipping in the fourth quarter.  Asus, Lenovo and Samsung have already announced plans to offer these low power GPUs and we are seeing strong design win momentum for these GPUs because they deliver discrete level graphics performance while stretching battery life in both traditional and ultrathin notebook.","Our longer-term transformation to drive growth in adjacent high growth markets continues to gain momentum.  In the server space, we will combine our extensive 64 bit design experience, X86 processor IP and ARM processor cores with our SeaMicro Freedom fabric to continue to drive leadership as the industry transitions to dense servers.","We believe we already have significantly more dense server customer installations than any other competitor making our SeaMicro technology the most tried dense server solution available in the industry.","Now, in ultra low power clients, we bolstered our SOC design capabilities with new engineering talent, simplified our development processes to improve our execution speed and quality.","Our Kabini and Temash SOCs for notebooks, tablets and convertibles are exceeding our expectations.  More importantly, the strong value proposition and differentiated features of these products are exceeding customer expectations as well.","Kabini will be the first industry quad core X86 SOC and Temash is expected to be the highest performing tablet SOC available in the market, more than doubling the graphics performance of our current generation tablet offering.","Finally, we have strong design wins for our embedded and semi-custom APUs.  Initials products based on these APUs are expected to launch later this year, driving our embedded semi-custom business to more than 20% of our revenue mix by the fourth quarter.","So in summary, we have made good progress in the fourth quarter with our turnaround.  We delivered on our financial and customer commitments, effectively managed cash, reduced inventory and lowered operating expense in the face of a difficult market.","We will complete the majority of our restructuring actions this quarter with a goal of reducing our overall cost structure by 25% from early 2012 levels by the third quarter of 2013.","We are introducing strong new APU and graphics offerings in the first half of 2013 that will accelerate our AMD business with the ultimate goal of returning AMD to profitability and positive free cash flow in the second half of this year.","We are also making good progress on the multiyear transformation of AMD that will allow us to deliver 40% to 50% of our future revenues from high-growth markets where our IP is a differentiator. Our embedded semicustom APU business remains on track to contribute approximately 20% of our overall revenue by the end of this year, and our SeaMicro dense cloud server business continues to gain momentum.We remain focused on the steps we must take over the next several quarters to turn AMD around and deliver consistent profitability and growth. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to our newly appointed CFO, Devinder Kumar. Devinder?Devinder KumarThank you, Rory. 2012 was a challenging year in which we made strategic investments and began to take the actions necessary as part of our corporate and financial reset to position the company for future success in a changing computing landscape.","In the fourth quarter of 2012, we announced restructuring actions and operational efficiencies designed to reduce our expense structure and help return AMD to future profitability and free cash flow generation. The restructuring plan includes a reduction of AMD\u2019s global workforce in the fourth quarter of 2012, and the first quarter of 2013, by approximately 14%, and will result in operational savings of approximately $190 million in 2013.By the third quarter of 2013, we expect to reduce operating expenses to $450 million per quarter, down 25% from the first quarter of 2012. As we ended 2012, we also successfully amended our wafer supply agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES to better align our wafer purchase commitments with current PC market dynamics, strengthen our balance sheet, and help us achieve our operating goals.Broader macroeconomic issues impacted consumer PC spend in the second half of 2012, as the challenges we faced in the second quarter continued through the end of the year. We faced a difficult selling environment, which negatively impacted our overall 2012 financial performance.Let me provide some details on the full year 2012 financial results. Revenue for the year was $5.4 billion, down 17% year over year. Non-GAAP gross margin was 41%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $2.2 billion, lower than what we guided, due to the restructuring actions and alignment of expenditures with business expectations.We achieved non-GAAP operating income of $45 million. We managed capital expenditures down to $133 million in 2012, below guidance of approximately $200 million.Tax benefit was $34 million, better than guidance, due to a one-time benefit of $36 million related to the SeaMicro acquisition.Cash balance as of the end of the fourth quarter was $1.2 billion, above the optimal zone of approximately $1.1 billion and well above the target minimum of $700 million needed operationally.Let\u2019s turn to the fourth quarter results. Revenue for the first quarter of 2012 was $1.16 billion, down 9% sequentially, driven by a revenue decline in the Computing Solution segment of 11% and a decline of 5% in the Graphics Products segment. Revenue declined due to lower volumes across both segments.To derive non-GAAP gross margin and other non-GAAP financial measures, among other items, we excluded the impact of the lower of cost or market charge related to the GLOBALFOUNDRIES stake or pay obligation of $273 million discussed in more detail in my CFO written commentary, which has been posted online.Non-GAAP gross margin was 39%, up 8 percentage points quarter-over-quarter. Gross margin in the third quarter of 2012 was 31%, and this was adversely impacted by an inventory write-down of approximately $100 million or 8 percentage points. Fourth quarter 2012 gross margin also benefited from sales of higher priced second generation desktop APUs.Non-GAAP operating expenses were $506 million, lower than guidance, primarily due to tight spending controls in the quarter.  R&D expenses were $313 million, 27% of net revenue.  SG&A expenses were $193 million, 17% of net revenue.","Non-GAAP operating loss was $55 million and non-GAAP net loss was $102 million.  Interest expense was $45 million, flat compared to the prior quarter.  Tax provision for the quarter was $4 million compared to zero in the prior quarter.","The non-GAAP loss per share was $0.14 calculated using 747 million basic shares.  Adjusted EBITDA was $30 million, better by $65 million from the prior quarter\u2019s negative $35 million, excluding the LCM charge of $273 million.","Now, switching to the business segments, computing solutions segment revenue was $829 million, down 11% sequentially.  Client product revenue declined 13% sequentially primarily driven by lower microprocessor unit shipment.","Server business revenue increased sequentially, driven by an increase in unit shipments of compute systems focused on dense servers.  And chipset revenue declined in line with microprocessor unit shipments.","Computing solutions operating loss was $323 million, an increase of $209 million sequentially primarily due to the $273 million SEM charge.","Graphics segment revenue was $326 million, down 5% sequentially primarily due to an 8% sequential decline in GPU revenue partially offset by record game console revenue and record work station graphics sales.","Graphic segment operating income was $22 million, up $4 million from the prior quarter primarily due to the higher game console revenue.","Turning to the balance sheet, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance including long-term marketable securities at the end of the quarter was $1.2 billion, down $297 million compared to the end of the third quarter of 2012.","The decrease is primarily due to operating cash flow of $286 million, which included a few specific cash payments as follows: payments to global foundries of $130 million comprising of $50 million for the limited (inaudible) exclusivity and $80 million termination fee related to the take or pay agreement and cash payments of $46 million related to restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2012.","We exited the quarter above our target optimal cash level and well above the target minimum cash level of approximately $700 million.  That, as of the end of the quarter, was unchanged at $2.04 billion.","Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter was $630 million, down $53 million compared to the end of the third quarter of 2012 primarily due to lower revenue.","Inventory was $562 million exiting the quarter, down $182 million or 25% from the prior quarter due to a decline in MPU inventory primarily as a result of the amendment of the wafer supply agreement with global foundries.","Now turning to the outlook, for the first quarter of 2013, AMD expects revenue to decrease 9% sequentially plus or minus 3%.  Gross margin is expected to be flat sequentially.","Operating expenses are expected to be approximately $495 million and we expect inventory to increase sequentially ahead of new product introductions and technology transitions.","For 2013, we expect operating expenses to be at $450 million by the third quarter of this year, capital expenditures of approximately $150 million for the year, taxes of approximately $4 million per quarter.","We plan to be free cash flow positive by the second half of 2013 and we expect to maintain cash balances in the optimal zone of $1.1 billion for the year and well above the target minimum of $700 million.","Overall, we have taken significant steps to align our business with today\u2019s PC environment and position the company to capitalize on new opportunities in adjacent, high-growth markets in 2013 and beyond.","We expect our restructuring actions and our (profit) reset to position us to return to profitability and free cash flow generation in the second half of 2013.  I will now turn it back to Ruth for the Q&A.  Ruth?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Ruth Cotter","Thank you, Devinder.  Operator, we\u2019re now happy to pole the audience for question.","Operator","(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from the line of David Wong from Wells Fargo.","David Wong \u2013 Wells Fargo","Embedded revenues, Rory, I think you said you\u2019re still on track to hit 20% of revenues by 4Q for the embedded revenues.  Can you give us some idea as to how things will ramp in the first, second and third quarter?  Will you get any significant embedded sales in those three quarters?","Rory Read","Yes, David, we already have an interesting embedded business already in place.  What we\u2019re going to see as we continue to invest in that area to leverage our differentiated IP and our leadership APUs is a move into some of the higher growth segments.","We mentioned on previous calls that those are currently confidential and they\u2019ll be announced as the year moves on.  We should see us build that revenue starting in the next several quarters and it ramps throughout the year to that 20% level.","David Wong \u2013 Wells Fargo","And my other question is over the last several quarters since you\u2019ve been at the company and you\u2019ve been forming your long-term strategic goals, has your thinking changed on how AMD should be transformed?  Are there new segments you now think AMD should address or, alternatively, areas that you\u2019ve decided AMD should exit?","Rory Read","Yes, it\u2019s interesting, David.  Over the past 16 months of being here at AMD, it\u2019s clear that this company has a deep base of intellectual property.  It has a huge asset pool in terms of the talented engineers and dedicated AMD-ers across the planet.","And this is an unprecedented period of change in the industry.  Our strategy remain basically fundamentally consistent throughout this.  The only thing that\u2019s really changed is the time period that we need to execute that change and accelerate into that.","First, it\u2019s a three-phase turnaround.  One, reset and restructure the company.  And I think here in fourth quarter you see us making that kind of progress where we\u2019re delivering on the commitment, we\u2019re executing and managing our expense, we\u2019re managing our cash properly and we\u2019ve improved our inventory position significantly.","With that, we\u2019re on a drive to get to $450 million by 3Q.  Then we need to execute and accelerate in 2013.  That\u2019s where we hit the top of the curve of this restructure and reset phase and begin to move into the launch of these powerful new products that we have in place.","At CES, Lisa and I spent a lot of time with customers and they were excited about Richland, which has now launched, and they were excited about Kabini and Temash.  Kabini is a follow on to our most successful Brazos platform.","And then, Temash, into the low power segment, these are very interesting products and we\u2019re going to continue our industry leadership into the graphics segment.  And then dense server had its best quarter ever and showing the foundation for future growth.","But ultimately where we have to take this company is we need the transforming and need to take advantage of where the market is going.  The high-growth segment, those areas where we can apply our innovation to lead, that\u2019s where we have to take the third part of our step.","And we\u2019re making those investments now.  In dense server, we\u2019re already seeing the early progress with SeaMicro that I mentioned.  And then moving into embedded, semi-custom.  This year will be 20% but our ultimate objective within the next three years is to move to 40% to 50% of our revenue in those segments.","And then obviously the opportunity for us to build on our long heritage in the client segment around low form \u2013 new form factors in the low power segment.  These are areas where AMD can create leadership, diversify its portfolio, build on its long history of success and its differentiated IP for leadership.","Dave, I think that\u2019s the one, two, three-step approach that we need to take.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.","Patrick Walsh \u2013 Credit Suisse","I just had a quick question relative to some of the charges.  So in the fourth quarter it looks like you guys took a larger-than-expected charge.  How should we think about these one-time charges going out through 2013?","Devinder Kumar","I think if you look at Q4 you\u2019re right about the one-time charge and let me just take a moment to explain that.  We had previously said a $165 million one-time charge and $110 million of our termination fee related to the WSA would be spread over Q4 and Q1.","As we completed the analysis from an inventory standpoint, it was more appropriate to record almost the whole charge in Q4 and we went ahead and did that and that is $273 million.","At this point in time, even with the restructuring charge that has been taken in Q4, we do not anticipate anything significant happening in the 2013 timeframe.  There are some actions that might be taken that would lead to it, but at this point, I don\u2019t think anything is anticipated.","Patrick Walsh \u2013 Credit Suisse","Then just another question on the embedded segment; just curious if you could give any color how that mix could look over time in terms of what percentage of that is gaming versus other embedded revenue.","Lisa Su","Just a comment on the embedded revenue, so we put embedded and semi-custom designs in one bucket and we would certainly see the embedded business tends to have a long design in cycle and then a long lifecycle as well.","So we have very good visibility in terms of execution for the target that Rory mentioned, 20% of our revenue by the fourth quarter of this year.  And then as we go forward, we would expect to add additional high volume design wins to that bucket.","Rory Read","It\u2019s interesting, as we mentioned in the earlier comments, those parts are already in their validation phases here.  We\u2019re working through those tracks and that protects those key design wins that drive that 20% in terms of the revenue objective by 4Q.  So we\u2019re on track and making solid progress in terms of the delivery of those key new solutions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann \u2013 Raymond James.","Hans Mosesmann \u2013 Raymond James","Rory, a couple of question, you\u2019re going to end up being about six, maybe nine months ahead of the competition in a quad core type of (inaudible).  What are the skill sets that you\u2019re bringing forth to do that?","And the second question is any commentary about the capacity additions that your rival is going to be making for next year and subsequent to that.","Rory Read","So, Hans, from the standpoint, we are working to create strength in our core businesses at the same time working to capture those new opportunities outside of the traditional space.  And over the next two years you\u2019re going to see us rebalance that business where we have a more even split across the non-PC portions and the PC portions.","What\u2019s kind of interesting, as you talk about the leadership in the quad core space of the SOC, that\u2019s a powerful product with Kabini that\u2019s launching this year.  Again, it\u2019s in its final phases of test.  I\u2019m sure Lisa will comment in just a second.","What we\u2019re trying to do in this segment is, again, create the leadership that we\u2019ve done in the past with Brazos and then to apply that same kind of knowledge into Temash, which brings us down into  the fan lift tablet segment.","Now, from a talent standpoint, what we\u2019ve really focused on is a mix of industry knowledge across the semi-conductor space and you\u2019ve seen us bring in interesting players across the past 12, 15 months, players that are from the who\u2019s who of the industry, they know the semi-custom space, they know microprocessor design, they know semi-custom and of course embedded.","These talents also you can see with the (Kellers) and Mark Papermasters and obviously Lisa Su, the experience to deliver that in industry leading microprocessor design and that\u2019s why I think you\u2019re seeing some of that progress around Kabini.  Lisa, you want to add a thought or two?","Lisa Su","Yes, Hans, just to answer the question about the tablet category, we\u2019re very excited about our Temash tablet because it really is satisfying a new space in terms of performance tablets that\u2019s separate from what today\u2019s consumption and the higher power tablets that are out there.","I think it is an opportunity for us to lead.  I think from a mobile standpoint, this is where we think there\u2019s sweet spot for full Windows 8 capable tablets and extending down to quad core to very low power points. So as we build out this part of the roadmap, it\u2019s about system on chip designs, getting much more flexible in how we reuse IP, and getting products out to market at the right time. So having these products out the first half of 2013, very, very important to catch the strong back to school cycle.Hans Mosesmann \u2013 Raymond JamesThanks, and the follow up is comments on capacity?Rory ReadIn terms of capacity, what were you curious about?Hans Mosesmann \u2013 Raymond JamesYour competition across the way there is going to add a lot of capacity it seems.Rory ReadOur focus, again, I think, is clear and very focused. We\u2019ve got to stay on this reset\/restructure, get that done and behind us. I think we\u2019re moving through that well in terms of getting the cost model, then getting into the execution of the acceleration. That\u2019s the key. It\u2019s about getting those products in market.Lisa just talked about it in terms of Kabini and talked about it in terms of Temash. It\u2019s around the embedded segment. That\u2019s the key for us, and the customer acceptance, whether it\u2019s in the industrial segment, the gaming segment, our traditional OEMs or ODMs, they\u2019re very interested in the products that we\u2019re creating in \u201913. That\u2019s the key for us.We do that, we correct the turnaround, we get to the lower operating model, and we return to profitability and growth. At the same time, continue to focus on where the market is going around dense server and around the areas of that tablet, mobility segment, as well as continue to expand into the embedded semicustom opportunity. I think we have to focus on what we\u2019re good at and getting the products executed. That\u2019s key for us. \u00a0OperatorOur next question comes from CJ Muse from Barclays. Your line is open.CJ Muse - BarclaysI guess first question on gross margin, guided flat despite revenues down 9%. Can you walk through the drivers there between mix? Any sort of moving parts with the WSA, with GF, or with any other drivers that we should be thinking about? And then how we should think about the trajectory post-Q1?Devinder KumarI think all of the factors you mentioned come into play from a product standpoint. WSA is behind us. We renegotiated that and amended that, as we announced in December, so it is in effect for 2013. We see stability from a gross margin standpoint, even though the PC environment continues to be dynamic. And from that standpoint, we are projecting in Q1 of 2013 that we\u2019ll be able to maintain approximately flat gross margin at 39%.CJ Muse - BarclaysAnd I guess, given what you\u2019ve seen and what you\u2019re guiding to here on the gross margin side, is there an update in terms of what you expect breakeven was in terms of top line on an operating level basis? I believe a few months ago you had said $1.3 billion.Devinder KumarRather than focus on that, I would just like to reiterate and maybe add some color on the guidance we\u2019re providing for 2013. The PC market, as Rory said earlier, you know we see it as challenging for the next couple of quarters at least. And therefore, we\u2019re not providing any guidance from a revenue standpoint for the year.From an OpEx standpoint, we have a trajectory to get to $450 million by Q3 of 2013. CapEx, as I said earlier in my remarks, $150 million for the year. And then finally, free cash flow positive and profitable by the second half of 2013. So that\u2019s the guidance we\u2019re providing for the 2013, from a viewpoint of the financials as we sit here right now in the early part of 2013.CJ Muse - BarclaysAnd then last question from me, in terms of the cash outflows in Q1, can you confirm what those positions are? I believe you owe $175 million for SeaMicro and another $175 million to GF. Is that correct? And are there other moving parts there?Devinder KumarYou are correct. Luckily just for one of the $175 million that you mentioned. The SeaMicro acquisition happened early part of 2012. We\u2019ve paid for that. That was all done as part of last year. But you are correct about the $174 million to GF to be paid in Q1 of 2013.","And the other payment that we have, which I mentioned in my remarks, is the $31 million for the severance charges for the actions we are taking from a restructuring standpoint. But those are the two specific payments that will occur in Q1 2013.","And then from our standpoint, as I\u2019ve said several times, from a cash standpoint, you know, we have a target minimum of $700 million but we plan to maintain a cushion between the $700 million and actually maintain closer to the $1.1 billion which is what we call the optimal cash balance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley.","Joseph Moore \u2013 Morgan Stanley","First, just a quick follow-up on the last question.  Have you \u2013 where do you stand on the sale leaseback of the headquarters?","Devinder Kumar","It\u2019s in progress and we are targeting to complete that within this quarter and we should net somewhere between $150 million and $200 million for the sale leaseback transaction.  The only clarification I\u2019ll make there is this is the Austin Campus.  Our headquarters are still in Sunnyvale, California.","Joseph Moore \u2013 Morgan Stanley","And then with the R&D, you\u2019ve taken a lot out of R&D spending already.  You\u2019re going to take that down further by Q3.  But it seems like there\u2019s more on your plate, now.  You\u2019ve put the ARM server roadmap, SeaMicro, the embedded opportunities.","Is there something coming out of R&D to let you make those cuts and feel like you\u2019re not cutting back or is there a risk that you cut too far in any one area?","Rory Read","No, the focus around expense management in terms of driving that off expense line is really across all parts of the business.   We\u2019ve tried to focus those areas where we thought there was efficiency and productivity to be gained.","For example, there is opportunities for us to dramatically reduce the number of different process technologies we\u2019re running in our various foundries.  That drives all the IP to be written to multiple libraries.","We very much focused in terms of efficiency to drive the number of metal layers, the way we reuse our IP, the IP development process that Mark Papermaster and Lisa Su have implemented through our technology board.","We are seeing efficiencies and productivities through that.  At the same time, we\u2019re driving to improve our focus in terms of the types of design wins we go after.  We don\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s really not the best business practice to go after just a gigantic number of design wins.  We want those high runners, those design wins that drive volume.","Every design win drives cost, drives back end execution, testing resources.  When we drive to hundreds of design wins, some of those are 25,000, 50,000 units.  Those are not efficient.","We\u2019ve been focusing with Lisa\u2019s business unit teams and John Byrne\u2019s sales team to really identify those design wins that get the volume and get to the most efficient usage.  That\u2019s how we\u2019re driving that kind of focus in terms of efficiency and productivity and those are just a few.","We\u2019ve implemented the financial transformation system on the back end.  John Docherty on the supply chain has an intense focus across each of his processes to drive that efficiency, to improve our execution.","And what\u2019s interesting, we had some schedule challenges in the middle of summer last year.  The second half of the year, the progress that the business unit teams and the technology teams have made on our 2013 roadmap part has been very consistent and on schedule.  So I think we\u2019re making the right moves to push for that efficiency, look for the reuse of IP, create the ambidextrous architecture that\u2019s reusable and to drive efficiencies across the portfolio.","And, in fact, we announced a new Senior Vice President, Chekib Akrout, who is driving that transformation and efficiency focus across our entire business as a full-time job.","Devinder Kumar","If I might add, I\u2019ll just add one comment to that.  If you look at our OpEx in Q1 2012, it was closer to $600 million and in Q4 we\u2019ve ended closer to $500 million level, so we\u2019ve already taken out approximately $100 million of expenses and the restructuring actions that we took from headcount and some facilities actions that we are putting in place happened very late in Q4 and obviously we have some going on in Q1 2013, so those benefits obviously as you know, lag the actions and we\u2019ll see the full benefit of that expense reduction in Q2 of 2013 and that should help us while protecting the R&D investment that Rory talked about to get to the full $50 million by Q3 of 2013.","Rory Read","And again, at the end of the day, our company hinges on the products that we create.  \u201913 roadmap looks strong.  It\u2019s across the board in terms of the execution, the schedules and the launches are tracking right to the schedules that we laid out.","We\u2019re working on \u201914, \u201915 and \u201916 in terms of how to transform our business, in terms of those high-growth segments, and how do we continue to leverage our leadership in the client space and the graphics space to continue to deliver that product focus. We have protected through this process of budgeting those areas where we know the highest growth will come over the next several years.","OperatorOur next question comes from JoAnne Feeney from Longbow Research. Your line is open.JoAnne Feeney - Longbow ResearchI wanted to go back to the discussion about gross margin. So in the last quarter, desktop was stronger. I was wondering, first of all, if you could clarify whether that was purely a mix shift within desktop, say on lower volume shipments, or if you actually saw an increase in units sequentially in the fourth quarter in addition to, it sounds like, an ASP rise. So that\u2019s sort of number one.And then number two, what are you thinking about for mix for 2013? Do you see more lower-end PCs and tablets? And then how are your margins across those different kinds of products and what do you think could drive either gross margin to stay where it is or perhaps to expand into 2013?Lisa SuLet me take some of the comments on the mix on the gross margin in the fourth quarter. So in the fourth quarter, I think we took a very balanced approach to managing the margins. I think we saw some positives and some negatives in the desktop business. We did see an increase in desktop ASP, primarily because we introduced our higher-end Athlon FX series as well as the new A-Series Trinity APUs into the channel, and that drove ASPs up a little bit on the desktop side. There were some competitive pressures on the notebook side. So all in all, very balanced approach to the margins.I think as we go forward for 2013 mix, we\u2019re not talking about full year gross margins. Devinder mentioned our guidance into Q1. When you look at the mix there, we would expect that as we get into the second half of the year, we will have the higher end of the A-Series, the A8s and A10s, but there\u2019s of course a balance with what happens in the market. So all in all, I think that\u2019s where we are.JoAnne Feeney - Longbow ResearchAnd then a quick follow up. The changes that you have been talking about, you and Rory and Mark, on simplifying the manufacturing process, reducing the number of wafer processing steps for example, adopting a more standard process, presumably is expected to do two things: one, lower unit costs, and two, speed your time to market. I guess from our perspective of trying to understand where gross margin might go, can you give us any sense of the quantitative impact that you foresee from those simplifications on the cost structure?Rory ReadWell, from a cost structure, that\u2019s part of the way how we drive to the 450. That\u2019s one piece of it as I kind of highlighted. The idea across the development process, the way we interlock now, the focus that we have. In the past, custom, hugely long, complex designs were the way the PC market moved. In the future, it\u2019s going to be quicker, low power, more efficient design.What also you get from this approach, obviously you\u2019ll get time to market, you get lower costs. You also get better yield, which is also important in terms of really managing the business. So it has benefits across the board. And speed of execution, as we move forward in a model where you\u2019re going to see a consortium based model, and the proprietary control points, as some of X86 break down, these kinds of models are going to be key. So we\u2019re going to stay the course on that. That\u2019s helping us on the 450.From the gross margin, I think we\u2019ve given the guidance in first quarter. We need to focus on executing first quarter, and then from there we\u2019ll go forward.JoAnne Feeney - Longbow ResearchAnd then just one quick follow up. It sounds like the simplification and manufacturing is doing both. It\u2019s reducing OpEx and potentially improving your gross margin. But perhaps you could just give us an update on how the spread is on gross margin across your different products, from your mainstream Trinity Richland to your lower-end Temash and Kabini. Is that something that\u2019s widened, or narrowed? Or can you really not talk about that yet?Rory ReadWe wouldn\u2019t get into that level of detail. I think we\u2019ve given a good outlook in terms of the guidance for Q1.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Yeung \u2013 Citi","","Adeline Lee \u2013 Citi","Can you discuss your gaming consoles, which is a potential market for you?  And we just want to know when can we expect revenue to ramp and is that part of the inventory build that you have discussed in your CFO remarks?","Rory Read","Devinder, why don\u2019t you touch on inventory, how we manage it and how it progresses from here and then we\u2019ll touch on our embedded strategy which we covered before for Adeline.","Devinder Kumar","Adeline, inventory, as you\u2019ll observe, down 25% quarter-on-quarter but that\u2019s largely in the MPU inventory space and partly and largely due to the WSA amendment.  From my standpoint, if you\u2019re talking about inventory going forward, it\u2019s more in the $650 million, $700 million range is what I would call it for 2013.","And in particular, as you can imagine, as new business opportunities arise, new product introductions take place and, in particular, when you have process technology transition, that is going to lead to some increase in inventory and that\u2019s where it will be.  But I\u2019ll let Lisa or Rory answer the other part of the question.","Lisa Su","So on the gaming revenue, I think we talked about the Nintendo Wii U that was announced in the fourth quarter and that was part of the revenue that was reported in the graphics segment.","In terms of going forward, what we said is the embedded in the semi-custom business will ramp over this period in 2013 and we are on track for that 20% revenue target by the fourth quarter.","Adeline Lee \u2013 Citi","That would be more second half than first half.  Can I make that assumption?","Rory Read","Our embedded business will continue to grow toward the 20% in the second half.","Adeline Lee \u2013 Citi","And the follow-up is that now that you are seeing some success in the dense servers market, do you have an opinion about ARM versus 86?  And also, by the way, did you see \u2013 did that strength at SeaMicro that you saw came with Intel or AMD processors?","Lisa Su","So the dense server market is where we believe the growth is in the server business.  So we were pleased with the progress of our SeaMicro systems in the fourth quarter.  I will say that in the fourth quarter we started shipments of AMD-based SeaMicro systems as well as Intel-base and they\u2019ve gotten a good reaction.","I think as we go forward, we are committed to both ARM and X86 in the appropriate markets and, clearly, we\u2019ve stated that we will be doing ARM-based server chips and that will be in the 2014 timeframe and we continue to offer a strong lineup of X86 as we go through both our client and our dense server business.","Rory Read","Yes, and this is all consistent with our focus to drive reusable IP and true SOC methodology in an ambidextrous architecture.  This is an area where AMD can clearly differentiate and create leadership in the marketplace.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Covello \u2013 Goldman Sachs.","Mark Delaney \u2013 Goldman Sachs","I was hoping at first you guys could talk a little bit about your guidance on the revenue for the first quarter and why you think it is that you\u2019re guiding below your biggest competitor.","Rory Read","From my perspective, as I look at the PC market, Mark, that market is going to continue to be choppy in 2013, particularly in the first half.  Remember, if you go back to 1Q last year, there was a lot of concern about the flood that affected Thailand and the hard disk file and it was quite surprising as we suggested the supply chain would be quite resilient.","The numbers were quite strong out of 1Q.  We think there\u2019ll be continued chop and pressure in that first half of 2013.  And this market\u2019s a bit dynamic right now.  We do think (inaudible) is a very important event in the industry and I think that impact or effect will build over the course of the year.","We expect the second half to be stronger than the first half from my perspective.  And if I looked at the overall year, weaker in the first half, stronger in the second half, probably a net flat to slightly down. That\u2019s our view of it in terms of where we\u2019re expecting the market, and how we\u2019re planning to balance that in terms of the gross margin and in terms of the revenue line. And that\u2019s how we came to the conclusion.Mark Delaney \u2013 Goldman SachsThat\u2019s helpful. As a follow up question, the mobile space in particular, and tablets, there\u2019s been a lot of new entrants, companies that don\u2019t historically participate in the PC market that have been introducing products. And now that you guys are closer and farther along with some of your products for that space, I was hoping you could help us understand to what extent you guys are working closely and partnering with some of these new companies that you traditionally haven\u2019t worked as closely with.Rory ReadWell, I think what\u2019s important is that we see that same high-growth opportunity in those new form factors. And you can see it with the introduction of our relationship with Visio just here at CES, and that introduction of those two ultrathins and obviously in the tablet space. You\u2019re going to see us continuing to work across OEMs in the embedded space, new partners, and across the ODM segment to get that expansion and begin to build that market. But again, our focus is to build that over a two to three year period to drive that to 40-50% of our revenue across those high-growth segments. Lisa, any additional comments you\u2019d like to add?Lisa SuNo, I would agree. I think the key with the mobile space is that there are a lot of new innovations happening, both in the traditional OEMs as well as in some of the new entrants, as you mentioned. So yes, we are working across the board with a number of customers with these new products.OperatorOur next question comes from Steven Eliscu from UBS. Your line is open.Steven Eliscu - UBSActually, regarding the last question, I want to take a glass half full approach. This quarter, with your guidance, it appears you\u2019re going to lose a lot less market share to your competitor. Is this about Richland ramping? Or is this just about clearing excess inventories that you had on Llano in the channel last year? Rory ReadI think we\u2019ve had a clear focus for the past several quarters to improve our channel execution from a push model to a velocity model, where I have sell-through tracking in the relationship and data all the way through the channel. I think we\u2019re making steady progress in 3Q, 4Q, and as we move forward there. I think that inventory in our finished goods position, Devinder touched on it with our WSA work and the focus.We, at the end of Q2 and even in to 3Q were seeing pressure in terms of potentially building more inventory. And while we did have to take a charge in 3Q to address some of that, I think we\u2019ve done a strong job in terms of focusing on that inventory. That positions us for the new product introductions that we talked about at CES: Richland, Kabini, and Temash.And I think that\u2019s what positions us to move forward and begin to build this turn and acceleration in 2013 with the objective to get to profitability in the second half and positive free cash flow at that timeframe again. That\u2019s the key to our business. Steven Eliscu - UBSAnd as a follow up, you lost a lot of graphics share in Q2 and Q3, and want to get your view if the new [GCN] parts reverse that share materially or you get back to a level you were in earlier in 2012, or is this just about stabilizing share since your competitor isn\u2019t standing still either?Lisa SuLet me take that on the graphics business. The graphics business is very strategic to our overall strategy. I will say that we have lost some share over the last couple of quarters. I do believe we\u2019re at the low point in our graphics share based on what we can see in terms of new design activity.","We have a very strong channel approach with our never-sell bundle that we talked about last quarter and we will be building upon that this quarter.  And we also launched our new HD8000 series at CES that\u2019s now shipping in a number of mobile OEMs.","So I think the share is indicative of decisions that were made 12 months ago.  What we\u2019re looking at is really a strong portfolio as we go forward in graphics.","Rory Read","Yes, I may just a brief comment from the standpoint of my experience as I joined AMD.  The graphics team here that we have is leadership.  The kind of IP, the kind of engineering skill, the ability for them to innovate and drive, you \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you had a chance to walk through, Steven, the CES work that we showed there.","Yes, and I thought you showed some really interesting application of how you could create a surround compute environment leveraging the graphics capability.  And imagine that kind of solution moving forward.","Say they\u2019re building a brand new building and that that building\u2019s not even built.  You could create, with our technology, a sales room that created the windows and the graphics representation.","You say, well, what\u2019s this building on the 22nd floor look like at night and all the sudden the graphic engines fire up the windows.  You can see that world and you could apply that kind of surround compute that we see emerging, this new trend of conversions that the cloud is fundamentally driving and it\u2019s our graphics IP that\u2019s going to be a fundamental enabler of that future.","That\u2019s the world we\u2019re chasing.  We\u2019re not going after the past.  That standalone data and application on a singular device protected by a couple of proprietary control points, that era is ending.","The era that is in front of us is an interconnected world where there\u2019s almost a tsunami of new devices that begin to emerge and they\u2019re all graphically linked because the data and information, the applications are running on cloud-dense servers and these mega data centers and they\u2019re distributing information across a whole set of client devices.","They\u2019re efficient.  They\u2019re low power.  They\u2019re across embedded devices.  This is the opportunity, Steve, in front of us to really get after it and where we can see graphics taking the business moving forward.","Ruth Cotter","Operator, we\u2019ll take two more callers, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura.","Unidentified Analyst","The question I wanted to ask was if you could share some updates on 28 nanometer progress at global foundries as it relates to some of the issues you faced last year at 32 nanometer.","Rory Read","From our perspective, our supply chain has focused with our foundry partners across 2012 in improving execution.  And as I\u2019ve commented several times before, the work that we\u2019ve done with global foundries and across the foundry supply chain environment has significantly improved with that kind of disciplined approach.","We introduced last year the first 28 nanometer graphics products and leadership and now as we move forward, we\u2019re positioning ourselves with that refocus, better executing supply chain to move forward in 28.","Lisa Su","Yes, Sanjay, just to your questions about 28 nanometer and global foundries, we\u2019re pleased with our overall 28 nanometer bring up in all of our foundries.  So from a 28 nanometer standpoint, we feel very good about where the technology is and what it\u2019s delivering for us from a product standpoint.","Rory Read","And one of the things, Sanjay, that we\u2019re focused on is to make sure that those parts are delivered in time to the market, the (two seed) launches and that we get the parts in volume as we ramp through it so that it\u2019s not just an announce in a back end.","These are focused in terms of the execution of the supply chain to build the ramp at the beginning of the launch.  So that\u2019s something we focus very hard not to repeat the (Lano) kind of events of 2011.","Unidentified Analyst","As a follow up, I wanted to go back to the gross margin question and I was wondering if you could give us a sense on your (inaudible) semi-custom business.  What\u2019s the gross margin of that product line related to your PC business?  Is it lower?  Is it higher?  If you could give us any color there.","Devinder Kumar","Yes, we don\u2019t get to that level of granularity, Sanjay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya \u2013 Bank of America.","Aashish Rao \u2013 Bank of America","Question for Lisa: could you provide an update on when you expect pile driver architects for (Optron) servers to come out?  And related to that is could this refresh your server business or do you think long-term growth is more functional SeaMicro dense servers as well as ARM-based servers?","Lisa Su","Yes, so when we talk about our server business, we are definitely focused on increasing our investments in the dense server portion of the business.  So we recently announced our (Abudabi) lineup in Q4.  We also announced earlier this month an open compute reference platform that was based on a system that we call Roadrunner.","Those are both based on the pile driver architecture.  As we go forward, as we said, we are going to ensure that we double down in the dense server business and that includes RC Microfabric as well as our chip technologies with APUs and CPUs.","Aashish Rao \u2013 Bank of America","Devinder, let me try asking you the semi-custom embedded business question a different way.  You have noted that you expected to represent about 20% of sales exiting the year.  Directionally, how should we think about growth and op margins both on a percent as well as on a dollars basis as you go from progress through the year?","Devinder Kumar","Yes, I think as I said earlier, the PC environment, it continues to be dynamic.  Our business model, based on what you observed with the 20% obviously is evolving.  We are providing guidance for gross margin for Q1 2013 and we\u2019re not providing guidance beyond that time period.","Ruth Cotter","Operator, that concludes today\u2019s earnings conference call.

Lisa?","Lisa Su","Thank you, Liz, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. While 2015 was a challenging year from a financial perspective, the dedicated commitments of our employees combined with our long term technology investments and sharpened focus have created a strong foundation for future growth. In the fourth quarter, revenue decreased 10% sequentially to 958 million as seasonally lower semi-custom SoC shipments were partially offset by the second straight quarter of double digit percentage revenue growth in our Computing and Graphics business.","Looking at our Computing and Graphics segment, revenue increased 11% sequentially as we continued to improve the performance of our PC business. We had strong double digit sequential percentage growth in mobile APU sales, driven largely by increased Carrizo shipments and good sell through of AMD based PCs on Black Friday.","In the channel, we delivered our third straight quarter of sequential revenue growth and further reduced downstream product inventories based on improved demand for FX CPUs and A-Series APUs. We also made progress diversifying our client computing revenue as we further expand into the commercial PC market.","Second half 2015 commercial APU unit shipments increased more than 15% from the first half of the year. We believe we can continue to grow our commercial shipment based on the high volume wins we are securing both across larger enterprises and the public sector.","Now shifting to graphics, GPU revenue increased sequentially for the second straight quarter driven by improved AIB channel sales of our Radeon 300 series across the enthusiast, performance and mainstream segments and growth in professional graphic sales. The PC gaming market strength helped fuel a richer GPU mix and improved demand for our high end Radeon R9 series in the quarter. We expect this momentum to continue throughout 2016 as Oculus and HTC begin shipping consumer ready VR headset. The buzz and interest in VR is an exciting trend that is focusing the software industry\u2019s attention and some of its brightest minds back on the PC platform.","While the initial wave of VR will be focused on gaming, an increasing number of developers see VR as the most significant advancements in how we interact with technology, continued [ph] reduction of the mouse and graphical user interface. Most importantly these break through software experiences will only be enabled with high performance energy efficient GPU's. Overall we made good progress further stabilizing our PC business in the fourth quarter and we believe we are well positioned to navigate the seasonally weaker first half of the year and ongoing challenges in the China PC market due to macro conditions.","Turning to our enterprise embedded in Semi-Custom segment, revenue declined 23% sequentially, in line with our expectations as Semi-Custom sales decreased from their third quarter seasonal peak. We had record annual Semi-Custom unit shipments in 2015 and have shipped more than 50 million Semi-Custom APU's as a critical and trusted partner to Sony and Microsoft. Demand for gaming consoles looks strong through 2016 and we remain on track to generate additional revenue from new Semi-Custom business in the second half of 2016. We also began production shipments of our first 64-bit datacenter class ARM SoC and expect additional system introductions from our partners throughout 2016, as the ARM 64 infrastructure ecosystem further develops.","Now turning to the year ahead, we remain focused on completing our strategic work around three key growth pillars. First in PC's, even in a declining overall market we believe we can regain, client compute and discreet graphics share for the year driven by gaming, VR, commercial and our most competitive product roadmap in more than a decade. We have clear opportunities to regain GPU share in 2016 based on the performance per watt of our new GPU's and software leadership. Earlier this quarter at CES, we announced our new Polaris GPU Architecture which we expect to begin shipping in the middle of 2016. Polaris combines significant design enhancements as well as 14-nanometer FinFET process technology to deliver double the performance per watt of our current GPU offerings.","Customer response has been excellent, particularly in the Notebook space, where for the first time ever there will be a GPU architecture capable of bringing high end gaming and VR experiences for thin and light Notebooks. In client computing our opportunities to regain share in 2016 will be driven by our design win momentum, continued progress expanding into the commercial market and reentering the high performance desktop market late in the year with our Zen based Summit Ridge CPU. Our second growth pillar is in the $15 billion plus datacenter and infrastructure markets, driven by our FirePro GPU's and next-generation service CPU's. Our Zen based CPU development is on track to achieve greater than 40% ITC uplift from our previous generation and we're on schedule to sample later this year.","We have secured several key design wins with global OEMs for our Zen based service CPU and believe we can rapidly reestablish our presence in the datacenter when we bring our new products to market in 2017.","With FirePro we plan to leverage our upcoming Polaris architecture and suite of new software tools designed to dramatically simply GPU computing to accelerate the adoption of FirePro in the HTC and datacenter markets. Our third growth pillar is focused on further expanding the TAM for products and technologies through ramping our previously communicated Semi-Custom wins, converting additional Semi-Custom pipeline opportunities and gaining share in targeted embedded market. We also have near term opportunities to strategically monetize our valuable IP in 2016 through licensing and partnerships that are complementary for our product development effort.","I look forward to sharing the initial results of our IP monetization strategy in the coming quarters. While we expect revenue to be lower in the first half of 2016 compared to the second half based on the seasonality of the PC and gaming console businesses, swift and successfully executing our product and technology roadmap and plan to return AMD to non-GAAP operating profitability in the second half of 2016 and generate positive free cash flow from operations for the year.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter financial performance. Devinder?","Devinder Kumar","Thank you Lisa and good afternoon everyone. In 2015 notwithstanding a difficult PC market and financial losses we continued our multiyear effort to transition our business model by diversifying revenue and establishing a foundation for improved financial performance. We made progress in stabilizing the computing and graphics segment and achieved strong double digit percentage revenue growth in the second half of 2015. We also reduced overall channel inventory significantly from the prior year. In our EESC segment we had record shipments of our Semi-Custom SoCs powering the Playstation 4 and Xbox One game console. In total against the backdrop of a 28% revenue decline from 2014, we reduced our cost profile with a 14% decrease in OpEx, managed our inventory down and maintained our cash well within our target range of 600 million to 1 billion.","Now let me provide the specifics of the fourth quarter. Revenue was 958 million, down 10% sequentially driven primarily by seasonally lower sales of Semi-Custom SoCs partially offset by higher computing and graphics segment sales. The year over year decline was 23% due primarily to lower client processor and chipset sales and lower game console royalties. Gross margin was 30%, a 7 percentage point improvement from the prior quarter with 6 percentage points resulting from the impact of a $65 million inventory right down in Q3 and the remainder primarily from improved product mix in the computing and graphics segment. Operating expenses were 323 million, down 13 million from the prior quarter primarily due to lower headcount and ongoing expense control. Operating loss was 39 million and net loss was 79 million with loss per share of $0.10 calculated using 791 million shares. ","Net interest, other expense and taxes were 40 million in the quarter compared to 39 million in the prior quarter. The GAAP results include a 13 million tax settlement in a foreign jurisdiction. Adjusted EBITDA was negative 5 million improving from negative 55 million in the prior quarter. ","Now turning to the business segment. Computing and Graphics revenue was 470 million up 11% sequentially primarily due to higher notebook processor sales. This is the second consecutive quarter of double digit percentage revenue growth for this segment as we increased sales of both our client compute and graphics processors in Q4. Computing and graphics segment operating loss was 99 million improving from a 181 million in the prior quarter primarily due to higher sales and the absence of a third quarter 2015 inventory writedown. Enterprise embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was 488 million down 23% from the prior quarter primarily due to seasonally lower sales of our Semi-Custom SoCs. The operating income of this segment was 59 million down from 84 million in the prior quarter, driven primarily by lower Semi-Custom product sales.","Turning to the balance sheet, our cash and cash equivalence totaled 785 million at the end of the quarter up 30 million from the end of the prior quarter. Inventory was 678 million, down 83 million or 11% from the end of the prior quarter, primarily due to reduced levels of Semi-Custom SoC inventory. We have concluded our wafer through pre-profiling discussions related to the 2015 WSA amendment with Global Foundries and will be moving approximately 60 million of wafer purchases from that amendment to later in 2016. To date total repurposed shares [ph] under the 2015 WSA amendment are approximately $1 billion including approximately a 150 million of wafer purchases which were not taken until early in our fiscal first quarter 2016. We are currently negotiating the 2016 WSA amendment. ","Debt as of the end of the quarter was 2.26 billion, flat from the end of the prior quarter, including total borrowing of 230 million on our secured revolving line of credit unchanged from the prior quarter. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was a positive 21 million, an improvement of a 105 million from the third quarter of 2015. ","Turning to our outlook for the first quarter of 2016, which is based on the 13 week quarter AMD expects revenue to decrease 14% sequentially plus or minus 3% driven by game console seasonality and a cautious macro environment in China. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 32%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately 320 million. Interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately 42 million, cash and cash equivalent balances to be down approximately 100 million from the end of the fourth quarter, including 70 million of cash interest payments. This cash balance does not include any cash proceeds related to the ATMP JV with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics. We expect to close that transaction in the first half of 2016 pending regulatory and other approvals and expect cash proceeds of approximately 320 million net of taxes and other expenses upon closure. Inventory is expected to be approximately flat from fourth quarter level.","Our fiscal year 2016 is based on 53 weeks, and we plan to take the extra week in our fiscal fourth quarter. For the full year 2016, we expect revenue to grow year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating expenses between 320 million and 340 million per quarter as we continue to invest in leadership products and in line with our expected revenue profile. Interest expense, taxes, and other to be approximately 45 million per quarter, cash and cash equivalent balances to be in the optimal zone of 600 million to 1 billion, capital expenditures of approximately 70 million, inventory to be down year-over-year and to return to non-GAAP operating profitability in the second half of 2016 and generate positive free cash flows from operations for the year.","In closing, as we begin the New Year, we remain focused on financial and operational execution and look forward to building on our second half 2015 products and roadmap momentum throughout 2016 across the three areas that leads our outline, high performance PCs, the datacentre and TAM expansion through Semi-Custom and embedded opportunities.","With that I\u2019ll turn it back to Liz. Liz?","Liz Morali","Thank you, Devinder. Operator, can you please pull the audience for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, I sure can [Operator Instructions]. So we\u2019ll take our first question from David Wong from Wells Fargo.","David Wong","Looking at your guidance for growth -- year-over-year growth in revenue in 2016, you are starting the -- you are ending 20 [ph] with the last quarter your game console revenues down year-over-year. Do you expect game console revenues to grow in 2016 as a whole? And what other things will drive overall growth for 2016?","Lisa Su","David thanks for the question. So let me give you a bit of colour on the guidance and how we view 2016. So, if you look at overall 2016, we do expect to grow revenue and if you look at our business, we see certainly the second half of revenue will be stronger than the first half because of both of our businesses. Game consoles we see units going up 2016 to 2015, we\u2019ve also said in the enterprise embedded in Semi-Custom segment that we will be ramping some new design revenue in the second half of \u201916, so we see that as a positive growth driver. And then if you look overall at our Computing and Graphics business, we do believe even in a down PC market that we have the opportunity to gain share as a growth vector in our Computing and Graphics. So those are the overall drivers for the 2016 comments.","David Wong","Okay great and just a quick follow up, I understand that you don\u2019t breakout all the details. But can you give us some feeling as to whether your discrete GPU business is slowing year-over-year growth at the moment, either in the December quarter or expected for the March quarter?","Lisa Su","So, as you say, we don\u2019t go into that level of detail. I think what we have said is that we did see growth in our discrete graphics business sequentially in both Q3 and Q4. As we look into 2016 with our discrete graphics business, we have a strong product portfolio. In particularly, the ramp and introduction of our new FinFET products, codename Polaris, will happen in the middle of 2016. So that will be a \u201916 growth driver. So, certainly we\u2019ve seen some sequential improvement in the second half of 2015 and we look forward to those products releases in 2016.","Operator","And our next question is from Ian Ing from MKM Partners. Ian, please go ahead.","Ian Ing","Could you talk more about the channel business in light of your cautious comments on macro [ph] in China? Are you seeing weakness potentially in ODM business or the Whitebox market?","Lisa Structure","I think, overall, if you look at the channel business in the second half of the year for us, second half \u201915 relative to first half \u201915, we have made quite a bit of progress in the channel in terms of just overall inventory levels. We saw a good quarter in the fourth quarter in both North America and Europe. We did see a degradation in China towards the end of the fourth quarter and I think that our cautious comments throughout the industry about the early 2016 start for China.","So, I think overall what I would say is I'm pleased with the progress we've made in the channel. I think involves the desktop channel as well as the AIB channel, we've made some progress in the second half of the year. I think China is a factor as we go into the first quarter but I think overall, we still view the channel as a positive business for AMD and one in which we believe we can grow share.","Ian Ing","And then, Devinder your OpEx guidance range, 320 million to 340 million in the coming quarters, can you give us a sense of the timing of some of the upcoming masked [ph] costs given, you've got Zen based cores and Polaris coming up?","Devinder Kumar","I would say I think [indiscernible] there are new products coming out and they are some much needed costs -- costs I think that's more weighted towards later in the year from a Q1 time plan we have given, the guidance of the OpEx at the 320 level compared to where we ended up in Q4 of 2015. So, yes we do have support for the investments in the products we need and in particular the technology and product transitions and that we have coming out in 2016 and that's why you see a range in OpEx of between 320 million and 340 million and then the last factor that obviously affects the OpEx is obviously the revenue profile which as Lisa said earlier is stronger in the second half of the year than the first half of the year.","Ian Ing","And my last question, you're talking that all about some GPU share gains in 2016. I mean does still lot that comes from the Polaris launch starting mid-year or is that sort of sustaining business in the R9 series or accommodation?","Lisa Su","We have made some progress in with the R9 series particularly as in the fourth quarter. I think as we go forward it\u2019s a combination of things, if you look at our investments in graphics, they really include both hardware and software. So the Polaris family is excellent from a hardware standpoint in terms of the performance per watt that we get, but we've a number of software initiatives that we started over the past couple of months and will continue and we see all of those contributing to graphics momentum.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Sanjay Chaurasia from Nomura. Please go ahead.","Sanjay Chaurasia","One question on gross margin, I noticed that you're not providing gross margin guidance for '16 and I was wondering if you have clarity that you're revenue would be up year-over-year, what are some of the puts and takes here that's making you hold gross margin guidance?","Devinder Kumar","I think the key is if you look at -- if you look back over the last few quarters, we have made progress on the gross margin front, ending Q4 2015 at the 30% level and the guidance specifically for Q1 of 2016 is 32%. You're right, I haven't given guidance for the year. Pro forma [ph] puts and takes are really the mix of product as we get more into 2016 and then obviously the mix of business between our Computing and Graphics segment and the EESC segment.","In Computing and Graphics we have introduced some new products from the second half '15 and even going into '16 and you have some of the commercial success we've had and that obviously has gross margin, but at the same time we want to see how the year unfolds in particular on the PC side of the house given some of the comments we made about caution in China in particular. So, for the year I'm not giving guidance today, just kind of first quarter guidance at 32% of gross margin and we'll get into the year as we get into the next one or two quarters.","Sanjay Chaurasia","And there's a follow-up Lisa, a question on ARM servers. You indicated you're shipping to Seattle, but at the same time in your guidance you didn't mention anything about ARM contributing in '16 and my question is, is ARM service a meaningful strategy you for you in '17 and '18?","Lisa Su","So, Sanjay the ARM server did start shipments and we have shipped our first production unit, I think we have some design wins with it and I would call it a modest revenue contributor in 2016. We still see ARM strategically as an interesting market for the infrastructure market, but it is certainly developing bit slower than expected. So, I think overall I think it's an important proof point in terms of enterprise class server architectures with ARM, but it\u2019s a modest revenue contribution in 2016.","Operator","Thank you. So, we'll take our next question from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.","Vivek Arya","Lisa just a follow-up on the last one on ARM servers, the comment about progress being somewhat slower, do you think that's an AMD specific trend or does that apply to all the ARM server vendors?","Lisa Su","I think it's more of a market statement, Vivek than an AMD specific statement. I think the overall commentary, maybe if I just expand a little bit is, the datacenter market is really-really interesting and I think we all agree with that. I think x86 has a lot of momentum and that's one of the reasons that we've put quite a bit more emphasis on our x86 datacenter and infrastructure play. That being said I think ARM does have a lot of specific areas where it can contribute and it has done so. But I would say in servers in particular perhaps slower than originally expected, but still something to watch for the medium term.","Vivek Arya","Got it, and as my follow up, you know perhaps longer term question which is, what is the strategy to actually get to a meaningful earnings and cash flow growth. I understand the macro environment is a little tough right now, but the way I see it, a lot of the progress you guys are making on your embedded products is being offset by the declines in your legacy businesses and as the mix is shifting to your embedded products gross margin are sort of holding around that 30% level, but you're not really able to reduce cost. So sales are finding it tough to grow right, with that offset gross margins are not moving up that much and you are now going to hold OpEx steady also. So I'm just trying to understand what are we missing here that can help AMD be a more sustainably profitable company, thank you.","Lisa Su","Sure, let me try and then Devinder can add if he has some comments. So I think what you have to do is take a step back and look at overall the progress in year 2015 from a foundation standpoint and then what we hope to accomplish in '16 and forward. I think the most important message around sustainable profitability for AMD is around our product and technology roadmap and ensuring that we grow share in our target markets. So that you know certainly the goal.","I think if you look at some of the progress that we've made in the second half of '15 we have seen some stabilization in our Computing and Graphics business and actually a return to some sequential growth. As we go forward into 2016 we certainly have to continue that momentum in both our client computes as well as our graphics business in terms of gaining profitable unit market share and then as we go forward we have our data center strategy as well as Semi-Custom and new markets that will bring some additional opportunity.","So you know from a product standpoint, it is about getting our technology out there and I think we will enter 2016 with the strongest product portfolio we've had in a long time and we need to continue to work with our customers, on a design opportunity and moving the platforms into production as we go through the year 2016.","Devinder Kumar","If I can add Lisa, I think the other thing I would add is, if you look at the couple of areas that Lisa mentioned datacenter in particular, but also the embedded space as we talked about in our financial Analyst Day in May those are businesses that command higher gross margins. So Vivek to your point about the gross margins, I think longer term with that business kicking in, in 2017, we believe that we can get closer to the longer term model. 2016 we guided to operating I mean free cash flow positive from an operation standpoint and as we continue to manage the cost as you said, specifically the OpEx side of the house, improving the gross margin in and of itself obviously benefits the bottom line and that's kind of heading towards the longer term model, we outlined at the analyst day that we had in May of 2015.","Vivek Arya","Thank you. One last quick clarification. What PC unit declines Lisa are you assuming for 2016? Thank you.","Lisa Su","Yes, so if you look at the current market projections it's somewhere in the low single digits, I think if you were to talk to the customer set, it might go from low single digits to mid-single digits. So that's the environment that we are you know forecasting unit share growth.","Operator","Okay our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research, Stacy your line is open.","Stacy Rasgon","Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. First I was wondering if you could elaborate a little more on how you plan to gain share on PCs for the year, especially since it looks like Zen isn\u2019t really launch until the tail end of the year and looks like you're starting Q1 already in a hole if I compare your guidance versus Intel.","Lisa Su","Okay Stacy why don't I start and again Devinder can add. So overall if you look at PCs I think we'll have to wait until the numbers come out, but we believe we have gained a bit of share in Q4. I think if you look at the driving factors behind that, Stacy there were a couple of factors in 2015 I think we did a concerted effort to clean up on some of our channel inventory both on the OEM side as well as in the DIY channel. So that factor will be gone in '15 relative to 2016. I think if you look at the product roadmap I think the product roadmap is stronger and I think if you look at our commercial business that is also stronger, so it's leading to a stronger product mix. So those are the key factors.","Relative to the Q1 guidance I'll make a comment about Q1 guidance overall. Our Q1 guidance includes obviously both the Computing and Graphics and the enterprise embedded in Semi-Custom business. The Semi-Custom business is historically significantly lower in the first quarter of the year. If you look at the past couple of year it's been the case because we\u2019re coming off of a strong holiday season. So I would say that that has to be factored into the guidance and then if you look at the Computing and Graphics business I think what we're seeing is very consistent with what's out there in the market and we believe in that market, that set of market conditions we can gain share.","Devinder Kumar","The only thing I would add is Stacy I think it\u2019s too early to tell from a viewpoint of your thinking in terms of the guidance for Q1 that just based on the guidance we lose share in Q1 in the PC space.","Stacy Rasgon","If I just look at you down 14% and Intel down what they are, there is a differential there?","Devinder Kumar","I think the key is to look at the guidance that we gave and trying to pass out where the decline is and it's more weighted towards the EESC segment and then the Computing and Graphics segment.","Stacy Rasgon","Okay, thanks. So my follow up --.","Devinder Kumar","The other thing, just one last clarification, I think the thing to bear in mind and I think I\u2019ve said in my prepared remarks in our quarter in -- our quarter this year, actually both from a viewpoint on the quarter and the year-over-year, 53 week year and we have a 13 week quarter in Q1 as opposed to what the competitors you are doing I think it's more on the 14 weeks, I suppose than 13 weeks.","Stacy Rasgon","Even if you correct that, but okay. In terms of follow up, just very briefly does your guidance for a positive free cash flow for the year include the proceeds from the backend sale? And does your guidance for 32% gross margin for next quarter contemplate you selling any of the inventory that you wrotedown in Q3?","Devinder Kumar","So the first one is no, it does not. The free cash flow from operations have been positive for the year that does not include the proceeds from the joint venture for the backend facilities. And then the guidance for the margin at 32% Q1, does not contemplate any sale of -- previous sales of inventory.","Stacy Rasgon","And then free cash, that\u2019s not operating cash flow guidance that\u2019s free cash flow guidance? ","Devinder Kumar","Yes, that\u2019s free cash flow, I think the way we define it is operating cash flow less CapEx.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Ramsay from Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead Matt.","Matt Ramsay","I think there is some -- my observation looking into product roadmap is there is some pretty big hurdles passed, getting Polaris on FinFET getting Zen on FinFET over the next few quarters. Relative to some lower operating spending that you guys are doing as a company maybe we see you lay out some priorities for how you\u2019re going to roll out these products. Particularly, I am looking at how you balance Semi-Custom versus discrete GPU and how you balance Enterprise CPUs versus APUs when you roll out Zen? It seems like quite a bit to take on given the lower spending levels of the business as a whole. And I just wonder how you\u2019re prioritizing that adverse of the guidance for the year? Thanks.","Lisa Su","So Matt I think maybe a couple of comments. I will say that I am pleased with the execution on engineering that we have accomplished over the last 12 months. I think we have passed some significant hurdles. The transition to FinFET for us was very-very critical across our businesses. And I feel good about the state of the progress there. As a result as it reflects on 2016 spending I think Devinder commented earlier, but I would say that that\u2019s why we\u2019re giving ourselves a range in the OpEx from 320 million to 340 million. And we are being prudent in where we spend.","However, clearly, there is a significant focus on discrete graphics and what we can do in that space. I think we\u2019re very excited about the momentum around virtual reality and the momentum in gaming and we think that that\u2019s a very good market for us. I think relative to our CPU competiveness and regaining competiveness there that is a very key priority as well. So Zen across both our clients computing as well as our server markets are a priority. The good thing about our Semi-Custom business is it does rely on customer investments to customize the roadmap and so I think the combination of those things gives us a reasonable envelop to execute the go to market around the product portfolio.","Matt Ramsay","And as my follow up, I think I took away as an impression at least from the CES, a refocusing of investment on developers, particularly in the GPU space. Lisa maybe you could speak to that a little bit, and how you guys are trying to balance the priorities of the Semi-Custom business and consoles and gaming with re-kindling the brand and maybe re-kindling mindshare with developers in the PC gaming community? Thanks.","Lisa Su","Yes, I think the Radeon Technologies Group has added a lot of focus to our graphics activities. And I think as you said, it\u2019s both a hardware and software statement. So, the work we\u2019ve done around our drivers and trying to ensure that we have a good customer experience as well as a good development experience is certainly there. I think the main takeaway is we know how to do this, it's really a matter of getting the focus and getting it done.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Srini Pajjuri from CLSA Securities. Please go ahead.","Srini Pajjuri","Lisa just going back to your annual guidance for growth, if I start from down 14, I think you have to model double digit for the next three quarters, which is well above seasonal for you. So I am trying to understand, where the growth is coming from. Obviously you said, you expect to gain share, but can you take about the Semi-Custom win that's supposed to ramp in the second half, how big that opportunity is and when exactly you expect those ramps to come in?","Lisa Su","So, let me try to frame in this way. So if you look overall at our business, yes, we are projecting full year revenue growth 2016 compared to 2015 and so we would have to have some significant growth as we go into the second half of the year. If you -- independent of any new design the Semi-Custom business naturally is significantly higher in the second half than in the first half, especially third quarter it's kind of a peak for the business as we go into the holiday season and we continue to see that phenomena as our customers are giving us their forecast. We expect the base Semi-Custom business or the base game consoles to continue unit growth in 2016 versus 2015, there will be some modest ASP decline with that, and then we expect or layer over it some new Semi-Custom revenues starting in the second half of the year.","So, from what we see obviously a lot of things have to happen, but the Semi-Custom business is one that\u2019s we've been able to predict pretty well given the customer long-term forecast and then we have to continue the conversation around the Computing and Graphics business as we see how the markets work itself out in the first half of the year going into the stronger second half for the PC business.","Srini Pajjuri","And then as a follow-up I think what you said, it was last quarter you told us that you're looking to monetize some of the IP properties that you have. Can you give us an update as to -- based on your discussions how you see that opportunity, short-term and long-term?","Lisa Su","So on the IP monetization strategy, we will continue to update that quarterly as we go through the process. I think we have had a good, really good discussion around where to go there, I think there are several different avenues that we believe our IP will be valuable, I think on the straight patent side, we've said before we have 10,000 patents that are over a substantive number of technical areas including graphics and microprocessors and other semiconductor patents. Those can certainly be licensed or in some cases there maybe sales, however another area that we think has a lot of potential is the areas of technology licensing where we can help partners accomplish their objectives with patents and knowhow. So, we will update the results on that as we go through 2016 but we do believe it\u2019s a significant area for us going forward.","Operator","We will take our next question from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ross Seymore","Lisa one for you on, I guess that you're calling now the base enterprise embedded in Semi-Custom business. You talked about the gaming SoC business being up on the unit basis. But in 2015 that whole segment was down about 8% year-over-year. So, I guess my question is I know new things are coming in, in the back half of this year, but what gives you confidence that today's core business can actually remain anywhere close to flat considering that it fell in 2015?","Lisa Su","Ross, so let me give you some more color on the compares which might help. So, on the base EESC business if you were to look at product revenues of Semi-Custom game console SoCs, they were actually up a bit. So, overall units were up double digit percentage, ASP declined but less than that the product revenue was up. What you saw as segment decline was actually legacy revenue from server and embedded and if you remember we have some legacy revenue based on some of the longer up drawn products that we continue to sell and that has seen a drop off as well as our GCSS or C micro business was there in 2014 that we exited in 2015. So, that was the year-on-year decline on that was there.","And then I think as you go forward to 2016, I'm not being that specific about the base business but I will say I think units will be up and we'll have to see exactly how much up as the market go, but we certainly don't see it substantially down, if that's what you're implying.","Ross Seymore","And I guess piggybacking off that to an earlier question, this time for Devinder on the gross margin side. You correct me if I'm wrong here but what I heard as the answer to the earlier questions as to why you're not guiding for the full year gross margin was partially because the unknown mix dynamic in revenues, to the extent that's true, does that imply that the gross margin delta between the Computing and Graphics group and the EESC group even with the new ramps in Semi-Custom is likely to remain as wide as it has in the last year or so?","Devinder Kumar","I think we have to see how the year unfolds to be honest, I think if you want, like I said the guidance is at 32%, we need to see mix of product, we have some new products being introduced in both the businesses with the new design wins in the second half on the Semi-Custom side and then obviously on the CG side, you've heard us talk about graphics and computing, new products kicking in and so from my standpoint I'm almost see how it unfolds in terms of the mix of products, mix of the business before getting into the gross margin, but fair to say as you know the Semi-Custom business, just the way the model works from an early standpoint as lower gross margins than the computing and graphics side of the business, so that's a fair statement.","Operator","Thanks, our next question is from Chris Rolland from FBR & Company, Chris please go ahead.","Chris Rolland","On the Semi-Custom business I'm sure you guys have looked at prior console platform price cuts for customers and their effect on sell through. So I'd love to know how you're kind of thinking about that and potential reacceleration if that were to happen. Do you have any prior metrics you can share with us and then also, I think I know the answer, but if there was a platform price cut should we still expect a slow and linear reduction in your ASPs or might there be something a little bit more aggressive like a onetime step down?","Lisa Su","Okay so Chris, if you look at the Semi-Custom cycle and again these cycles are hard to predict, through this year through the end of '15 the game console units are far ahead of the previous cycle. So on the order of 20 million units ahead of the previous cycle. When you look at the significant price points I would say, they're sub $300 price point that start accelerating demand and you saw some of that this holiday season. So that had some impact. When you, your question overall in terms of acceleration I think again the game console guys know how to do this cost reduction and they've done it very well. Our price or ASP reduction are not step function reductions. They end up being pre-negotiated and in line with cost reductions that we have agreed to with our partners.","Chris Rolland","Okay, very helpful, also perhaps you can talk about ASPs in 2016 how you sort of see them trending with Summit Ridge and server products and how big a driver is that for top line and for profitability?","Lisa Su","I think it is very important that we see an improvement in our product mix and that's something that we've certainly been striving for in both our mobile products and as we introduce higher performance desktop and server products we should see that reflected in the ASPs. So the mix of business focusing on commercial versus sort of the low end consumer will help all those things but when Devinder talks about some of the pluses and minuses on gross margin it really is our ability to increase and improve that mix in our overall business going forward.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from Hans Mosesmann from Raymond James.","Hans Mosesmann","Hey Lisa, a clarification on Zen you said you had some design wins already on the server side of that roadmap. Can you give us a sense on what kind of server wins and what kind of an opportunity you see in terms of market share for the next several years as you come back to the market?","Lisa Su","Yes, so Hans, overall the Zen design win, we have been engaged very early on with you know large OEM and cloud providers on the Zen design point and the platforms that would be useful for Zen. So we have closed our first design win, we are working you know very closely with these OEM partners to make sure that they bring up their platforms concurrently with our own design validation and testing. I think the main message is we are on track with the schedule that we previously discussed in terms of sampling this year. We will introduce first in desktop and so we are having conversations with some of the PC OEMs about getting their platforms ready for desktop and then we will go into enterprise server first full year in 2017.","Hans Mosesmann","Okay and then as a follow up, what kind of performance point should we look at your initial Zen in the server space, is it Zeon E3 class type products or E5s or maybe you can help with some granularity there if you can?","Lisa Su","Yes, we believe that we'll be able to address let's call it you know 80% of the server CPU market with our Zen class of products. So that's a very high end but you know really the meat of the market.","Hans Mosesmann","Okay, thank you.","Lisa Su","Thanks Hans.","Liz Morali","Operator we'll take two more questions please.","Operator","Okay, we'll take our next question from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Joe your line is open.","Joe Moore","Great, thank you. I wonder if you could talk about the discrete GPU business you were first to market within high bandwidth memory and saw the benefit of that, did you see the benefit that you'd hoped for and with your competitor ramping HBM at some point presumably this year, does that blunt the momentum that you've seen in the GPU side?","Lisa Su","Yes, I would say HBM was a very good technology I think we got the performance benefits that we expected. It is still at the high end of the cost point range and so that's why we've introduced it just as the high end. I think HBM and all this 2.5E packaging technology is going to be really important over the next three years. So three to five years but definitely over the next three years, so, I think being first to market we've gotten a lot of experience on the technology, we will continue to use high bandwidth memory in our portfolio and as the cost goes down it will give us an opportunity to use it in a broader set of segments.","Joe Moore","And then as my follow up, have you talked about potentially Semi-Custom products in virtual reality? And to the extent that you have or can, does that going to have the same type of GPU requirement that we\u2019ve seen on the PC platform or is it possibly scaled down from that level of performance requirement?","Lisa Su","So I think there are opportunities to do customer implementations of GPU for virtual reality. I think the amount of graphics horsepower that\u2019s required and perhaps some of the form factors that you want to go into being smaller more portable would enable you to do that. I think it\u2019s early to talk specifics but I think that the general ideal that VR has a lot of requirements and doing something custom might be helpful, I think is absolutely on the mark.","Operator","Thank you. So we\u2019ll take a final question from Steven Chin from UBS. Steven, your line is open.","Steven Chin","Lisa if I could on the graphics win [ph] that side with the upcoming Polaris architecture later this year that\u2019s going to come out about four to five quarters after Fiji was released which is a pretty good improving in terms of timing or cadence compared to the previous generation. So I guess my question is, is this one year plus cadence for your GPU roadmap, is this something that can be synced going forward? And how does that compare relative to the OpEx run rate that\u2019s been your guidance for this year, is that the right quarterly run rate for backhand \u201916 that type of graphics roadmap first of all?","Lisa Su","Yes, so I think the overall answer is we do believe the cadence of graphics requires annual refreshes and we are going to invest to enable that. And I think the Polaris margin is significant because it\u2019s also a change in process technology which sometimes can run into other issues. But I think we feel very good about where we are there and you should expect that cadence to continue.","Steven Chin","And as my follow up, just given some of the product enhancements on the professional commercial graphic side and some of the designs wins you\u2019re talking about with Dell for example, I was wondering if you could help in providing colour from the customers insurance qualitative or even quantitative potentially in terms of the opportunity for AMD this year, especially given the macro backdrop, is that going to be some large step function up this year from some of those design wins? Or it pulls the macro potential and you have to say, somewhat of a large headwind for that, any opportunity?","Lisa Su","So I really view the macro as more of a headwind for the overall PC market. When you talk about professional graphics, I think it\u2019s such a specialized market that it is more about the product you offer and is it competitive and differentiated enough. I think it\u2019s fair to say that most of our customers would say the products are actually very good. So the overall product capability and performance is good. Our issue has really been are we investing enough in the software resources to help customers use some of our products. So I think on the professional graphics space, we do believe it\u2019s a growth opportunity, I think we\u2019re going to continue to invest in some of the software around that professional graphics and continue to make steady progress into 2016.","Steven Chin","Great, thank you.","Liz Morali","Thank you. That concludes our call for today. We would like to thank everyone for participating. Operator, you may close the call out.","Operator","Okay, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference. You may now disconnect and have a great day."]}}
