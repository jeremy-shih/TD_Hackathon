At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference.","Lisah Burhan - The Clorox Co.","Thank you, Todd, and welcome, everyone. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, our Chairman and CEO; and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet, and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com.","On today's call, we'll refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including, but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA, and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enable investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations.","Reconciliations with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available on our website, as well as in our SEC filings. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release.","Please also recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. I would direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to the impact of tax legislation.","Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcome to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.","With that, I'll turn to our top line commentary and I'll start by covering our Q1 top line performance discussing highlights in each of our segments. Kevin will then address our financial results, as well as updated outlook for the fiscal year. Finally, we'll turn to Benno to offer his perspective and then close with Q&A.","For the total company, Q1 sales grew 4% on top of 4% growth in the year-ago quarter. First quarter sales results also reflect the impact of 2 points of unfavorable foreign currency and about 3 points of benefit from the Nutranext acquisition, net of Aplicare divestiture.","I'll now go through our results by segment. In our Cleaning segment, Q1 sales grew 2%, behind the continued momentum in our largest business unit, Home Care, partially offset by about a point of negative impact from the divestiture of Aplicare.","Home Care delivered solid sales growth in the quarter, behind strong shipments in a number of Clorox-branded products and from ongoing innovation within our Clorox Scentiva platform, which just launched another new fragrance, Fresh Brazilian Blossom.","We announced price increases on a portion of the Home Care portfolio last quarter, which took effect in August. While still very early, we're pleased to report that pass-through and competitive reactions are generally in line with our expectations.","In our Laundry business, sales declined slightly mainly due to lapping the lift from the impact of the hurricanes in the year-ago quarter. Importantly, as was in the case of Home Care, our price increases in this business are also progressing in line with expectations.","Lastly, within our Cleaning segment, our Professional Products sales were flat due to the Aplicare divestiture. Excluding the impact of Aplicare, this business delivered high-single digit sales growth, behind volume gains across all three of its segments: Cleaning, Healthcare and Food.","Key products focused on stopping the spread of infection, including Clorox hydrogen peroxide wipes and sprays and Clorox Fuzion sprays, each recorded strong double-digit growth. In addition, Clorox Disinfecting Wipes had double-digit growth even with a price increase.","Turning to the Household segment, Q1 sales were flat as gains in Cat Litter were mainly offset by declines in Charcoal and to a lesser extent Glad and RenewLife. Our Cat Litter business delivered double-digit sales growth reflecting the benefit of price increases we took on July 1 and continued strong shipments of Fresh Step Clean Paws innovation.","Our Cat Litter business continues to show strong momentum having recorded eight consecutive quarters of market share growth. Charcoal sales decreased double-digits due to lower consumptions. We're putting aggressive plans in place for the 2019 grilling season and stepping up our brand building programs to re-energize existing consumers, as well as bring new consumers into the category.","This season, you'll see significant packaging upgrades that include new sizes and stronger claims. We're also launching 100% hardwood briquettes to address some consumer preferences for different grilling methods. Importantly, we're focused on partnering with our retailers to aggressively merchandise Kingsford, including extending the grilling season which has worked so well in driving the category growth for many years.","In conjunction with these plans, we're taking a cost-justified price increase in December. This will raise the overall value for the category, allowing us to reinvest in brand building, including innovation, that will maintain the superior value of Kingsford brand.","In Glad bags and wraps, Q1 sales decreased due to lower shipments of food containers and wrap. At the same time, the Glad trash business, which accounts for more than 75% of Glad's annual shipments, remain healthy with our premium OdorShield bags growing high-single digits. We're also supporting this business with a new ad campaign, Game Day, which ran on TV, digital and print for the first time in mid-September, touting the durability of our Glad ForceFlex Plus Advanced Protection trash bags.","Finally, turning to RenewLife. Sales declined this quarter due to lower consumption in the Natural Channel as we lost market share following out of stocks due to the supply chain challenges we experienced last summer. Our priority now is to reengage consumers and reclaim shelf space.","We'll do this by focusing on two things. First, we'll aggressively emphasize the superior value proposition of our brand through both new packaging and new claims, as well as through innovation that is meaningful to the fastest-growing value segment in the category. Second, we'll continue to lean into e-commerce, the fastest-growing channel for the category, where we're growing market share.","In our Lifestyle segment, Q1 sales increased 26%, mainly reflecting the benefit of Nutranext acquisition. While still early, we're pleased with the progress on the integration and then the initial start of the business. The increase in sales within this segment also reflects growth in Food, Brita and Burt's Bees business units.","In our Food business, sales grew strongly behind higher consumption, as well as distribution gains by the Hidden Valley dry dressing and continued momentum on Hidden Valley bottle dressings. The Hidden Valley equity continued to gain share for the 15th consecutive quarter. We also took a price increase on dry Hidden Valley products in August, which is progressing in line with expectations.","Brita grew sales this quarter, mainly behind strong merchandising during the back-to-college post period. Positively, we're seeing improvement in both shares and consumption. We're pleased to see progress behind innovation, as well as ongoing investment in the brand.","Burt's Bees sales were up for the quarter. Our lip care and face care businesses performed especially well, with both recording double-digit sales growth and lip care recording its 17th consecutive quarter of share growth. This is a reflection of a healthy core business, fueled by continued stream of innovation. We're also launching our first-ever TV advertising campaign in support of our face care line.","Beyond the core, our color cosmetics business, which launched a year ago, continues to be on track with expectations. We're also taking pricing on about 40% of our portfolio, most of which will take effect in February.","Finally, turning to International. Q1 sales decreased 5% as the benefit of price increases and volume growth were more than offset by about 12 points of unfavorable foreign currency impact, mainly due to the significant devaluation of the Argentine peso. In the face of these headwinds, we're now taking additional price increases in Argentina to mitigate the country's worsening foreign exchange environment.","We continue to execute our Go Lean strategy across International, which is helping us rebuild margins through pricing and cost savings initiatives, while selectively investing in margin-accretive parts of our International portfolio that has tailwinds. In Q1, that focus yielded double-digit volume growth in Burt's Bees International and RenewLife Canada.","Now I'll turn it over to Kevin, who will discuss our first quarter financial performance and updated outlook for FY 2019.","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Thank you, Lisah, and good morning, everyone. We're off to a solid start in the fiscal year, delivering strong sales and earnings growth, while continuing to generate healthy cash flow. As you saw in our press release, we have adjusted our fiscal year earnings outlook, largely based on our expectations to repurchase fewer shares in the open market this fiscal year and because of somewhat stronger-than-expected currency and cost pressures.","Importantly, our strategic initiatives are helping to offset much of the currency and cost headwinds. We remain on track to deliver gross margin accretion in the second half of the fiscal year, and we are maintaining our sales outlook. I'll provide further perspective on our full-year outlook in a moment.","Turning to our financial results for the first quarter. In the first quarter, sales grew 4%, which included 2 points of negative foreign currency impact and about 3 points of net benefit from the Nutranext acquisition and Aplicare divestiture. First quarter volume grew in line with sales.","Gross margin for the quarter came in at about 43%, a decrease of 150 basis points compared to about 45% in the year-ago quarter. First quarter gross margin included 280 basis points of unfavorable manufacturing and logistics costs and 130 basis points of unfavorable commodity costs. This is partially offset by 130 basis points of cost savings, as well as 90 basis points of benefit from pricing.","Selling, administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were flat versus the year-ago quarter. Advertising and sales promotion investment levels as a percentage of sales were equal to the year-ago quarter, with spending for our U.S. retail business at about 10% of sales.","Our first quarter effective tax rate came in at 22% versus 31% in the year-ago quarter, largely reflecting the benefit of U.S. tax reform.","Net of all these factors, we delivered diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.62, an increase of 11%.","Turning to cash flow. For the quarter, net cash provided by continuing operations came in at $259 million, about flat versus year-ago quarter. Free cash flow as a percentage of sales came in strongly at 14.3%.","Also as previously communicated, we initiated our open market share repurchase program of up to $2 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, we utilized about 4% of the total authorization amount of the repurchase program.","And since the inception of our program, we have now returned roughly 9% of our total authorization to shareholders. As a result of our first quarter activity, we will likely repurchase less than our initial plan of about $1 billion in fiscal year 2019.","Now I'll turn to our fiscal year 2019 outlook. We continue to expect fiscal year sales [growth] to be in the range of 2% to 4%. While we are maintaining our sales outlook, it does reflect a more pronounced devaluation of the Argentine peso. To help offset this, we are taking more pricing in our Argentina business.","Importantly, while still early, our U.S. pricing actions are broadly in line with expectations and, in a few cases, going better than planned. We have also recently announced additional cost-justified pricing actions on our Burt's Bees and Charcoal businesses.","Turning to gross margin. We now expect fiscal year gross margin to be about flat, reflecting the benefits of pricing and cost savings, offset by the impacts related to increased currency and cost pressures. As of now, we continue to believe we are on track to deliver gross margin accretion in the back half of fiscal year 2019.","We continue to expect fiscal year advertising and sales promotion spending to be about 10% of sales. Additionally, we continue to anticipate selling and administrative expenses to come in at about 14% of sales, buying productivity programs to help address ongoing cost pressures.","Selling and administrative expenses also continue to assume acquisition-related investments and more normalized levels for performance-based incentive compensation. We now anticipate fiscal year EBIT margin to be down, reflecting flat gross margin, as well as increased investments in advertising and the Nutranext integration.","Our outlook also continues to include the benefits of U.S. tax reform, with the ongoing assumption that our fiscal year tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%. We continue to expect free cash flow for fiscal year 2019 to come in at about 11% to 13% of sales.","Net of all these factors, fiscal year diluted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $6.20 to $6.40, versus our previous range of $6.32 to $6.52. Our updated EPS range is primarily driven by a revised expectation for open market share repurchases and, to a lesser extent, more pronounced currency and cost headwinds.","Our updated range also continues to include our previously communicated estimate of $0.08 to $0.12 of EPS dilution from the Nutranext acquisition. In addition, the $0.05 to $0.07 of negative impact from tariffs, which are affecting a couple of our business units.","In response to the challenging currency and cost environment, I believe we are taking the right actions to begin rebuilding gross margin in the back half of the fiscal year.","First, we continue to execute our pricing plans, including a recent announcement on Burt's Bees and coal. Importantly, given the significant currency devaluation in Argentina, we are also planning more price increases in our Argentina business.","Second, we are continuing to lean into our agile enterprise initiatives to drive cost savings and enhance productivity.","And, finally, we are continuing to execute our Go Lean strategy in International. We are pleased with our progress, which contributed to profit growth in the first quarter.","In closing, we are staying the course with our 2020 Strategy. We will continue to lean into key elements of our strategy to address near-term currency and cost pressures, while investing to sustain the health of our core business and deliver long-term shareholder value.","And with that, I will turn it over to Benno.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Thanks, Kevin. Hello, everyone, and thanks for being on the call today. I'm pleased to start our fiscal year with strong sales and earnings growth, notwithstanding a constant currency environment that's somewhat tougher than anticipated.","That said, I feel good about our execution and progress against the things we can control, including our innovation and pricing plans and cost savings programs. And I feel good about our ability to grow gross margins in the back half of the fiscal year.","Importantly, as much as we're focused on addressing these headwinds near-term, I want to emphasize that we won't compromise our investment in our 2020 Strategy and our pursuit of long-term profitable growth.","Here are our three themes for the quarter. First, Clorox continues to deliver growth in a tough environment by investing in brands that consumers love. Winning with consumers is why we are growing, and it is certainly the key to sustaining that growth over the long-term.","Our relentless focus on delivering superior consumer value through market-leading innovation like Fresh Step Clean Paws litter, Clorox Scentiva products and Glad premium trash bags is differentiating our products and our brands.","As expected, Nutranext contributed strongly to our first quarter results, and our integration efforts are on track. Nutranext's leading brands, Rainbow Light, Natural Vitality, Neocell and Stop Aging Now, are off to a strong start in the fiscal year.","Leaning into digital also continues to pay off. We're seeing ongoing strong ROI from digital engagements, which is expected to represent more than 50% of our media spend this fiscal year. We're also seeing sustained momentum in e-commerce across a number of brands, and continue to expect e-commerce to be about 8% of company sales this fiscal year.","Importantly, in this tough constant currency environment, we're committed to investing strongly in our brands, including innovation, to drive household penetration and superior consumer value. We are investing to sustain successful fiscal-year 2018 innovations and preparing for several major new product introductions in the back half of this fiscal year.","Second, our strategic plans are helping to mitigate stronger near-term costs and foreign currency pressures. We are leaving no stone unturned in our efforts to rebuild margin. We'll continue to have robust, margin-accretive innovation plans on many of our brands in the U.S. and in International.","And as Kevin mentioned, we'll continue to lean into our agile initiatives to drive cost savings. Year-in and year-out, Clorox has delivered more than $100 million in cost savings, and this year will be no exception.","We're also encouraged by our progress in International. While we're seeing more significant currency devaluation in Argentina, our team has been doing a good job executing against our Go Lean strategy to improve the long-term profitability of our International business.","Importantly, I am very pleased that early results of our pricing actions are strong. A true measure of a brand's strength is the premium it can command. With number one and number two brands making up for more than 80% of our sales and our track record of strong pricing execution, we were confident to lean into pricing early.","We continue to have constructive dialogue with our retailers and initial consumption has been positive. We're also executing pricing plans for Burt's Bees and Kingsford businesses. And in light of the more significant currency devaluation in Argentina, we're planning to take more pricing in our International business as well.","Finally, we remain committed to investing in long-term shareholder value. As I look at our global portfolio, I feel great about the continued strength we're seeing across so many of our businesses. We're seeing strong performance in Home Care and litter. Burt's Bees core business is growing nicely and we're seeing ongoing improvements in Brita. In addition, our Professional Products and International businesses are fundamentally healthy.","Clearly, we're not happy with persisting soft consumption on Charcoal, even after weather-related headwinds have subsided. If there is one brand, however, we know that's loved by consumers, it's Kingsford. We need to and will put better plans in place to grow household penetration as a way to improve consumption. We did this recently for Cat Litter, which is now one of our star performers. And with the right plans, I believe we can turn the Charcoal business around.","Importantly, as I mentioned earlier, in our focus to address constant currency pressures, we will not compromise investments behind our 2020 Strategy. We'll continue to invest in technology, to engage consumers online, and to evolve our supply chain and how we innovate.","We'll lean into portfolio momentum and invest disproportionately behind the more profitable brands in our portfolio that benefit from strong headwinds. And, finally, we'll continue to invest in our robust cost savings programs in the U.S. and in International.","So before we take your questions, I want to reiterate that I have every confidence in our 2020 Strategy to help us navigate proper currency and cost pressures, while guiding us to achieve long-term shareholder value creation. I have confidence in the strength of our leading brands that are delivering superior consumer value. And, finally, I have confidence in the leadership of Clorox people as we strive to continue to drive strong results the right way.","And with that, operator, you may now open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Dorer We'll take our first question from Joe Altobello of Raymond James.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. Hey, guys. Good morning. So first question \u2013 and it's probably a little bit fairly obvious \u2013 but why was there lesser purchase activity in the quarter? It seems like it's pretty straightforward. And maybe as a follow-on to that, I guess your guide this year was $1 billion in repo. You did $80 million or so in the first quarter. What's the new guide for total repurchase this year?","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Hi, Joe. Yeah, I can address that question. What I'd tell you is maybe just to reconnect where we started with this program. So as I think many of you folks know, we initiated this program back in May. And, at the time, we started pretty significant rerating of the sector. And based on the confidence, both Benno and I and the board have in our 2020 strategy, we felt it was the right time to initiate the program.","In Q4, we executed about 5% of our authorization. And then, this quarter, Joe, as you mentioned, we returned about $78 million of cash to our shareholders, about 4% of the authorization. What I would tell you is I commit to be very disciplined in the execution of this program. We have very specific criteria that we execute against that I won't share publicly, and that really drives our activities.","And so, if you look at our performance to-date, we've now executed about 9% of the total authorization at about an average price of $129. So, again, I feel very good about our progress, although I'd say it's certainly less than I anticipated back in August. And because of that, our progress in Q1 I think is appropriate to update the investor community that I don't anticipate we'll complete the $1 billion. I think it just means that it'll take a little longer to execute.","By design, this was not an ASR, so we'll maintain control over the timing and make smart decisions for investors. And then, I think because of that, as you saw, we reduced our EPS outlook by $0.12. I would tell you about 70% to 75% of the reduction in our EPS outlook was driven by our revised assumption on the share repurchase program.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. That's very helpful, Kevin. Thank you. And then, maybe secondly on Charcoal, how confident are you the decline you're seeing is purely weather and merchandising? And how do we square the commentary, Benno, with respect to those two issues and then the need to increase household penetration to drive growth? Thanks.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. Joe. Good afternoon. So clearly consumption continues below expectation, and that's post weather. So our commentary this quarter was that the weather-related softness that we saw earlier this calendar year certainly persisted. So now you know I would say that it's no longer just weather and that what we're seeing is recently lower household penetration.","My perspective would be on this business that it continues to be a solid category. People love grilling, millennials love grilling. It's a great brand that people love, that maintains a 75% all out (00:27:15) market share. And, frankly, it's been a solid growth contributor to the company over the last 10 years. And we've had, for a long time, a really strong track record driving consumption through innovation by focusing on extending the grilling season, which used to be sort of between Memorial Day and Labor Day activity. And now, with the help of activities, for instance, centered around the National Football League, we've been able to extend the season to become a year-round activity in many states around the country.","So what we're focused on now though is significantly strengthening our plans for the 2019 grilling season with this new focus on bringing new consumers back into the category to drive household penetration back up. And we're doing that with, as Lisah mentioned in her remarks, a significant improvement of our packaging, including new claims and graphics, new advertising, meaningful innovation. And we're working with retailers on, certainly, stronger merchandising plans for calendar year 2019. As you know, 2018 was somewhat hampered by bad weather.","So with that, I would say, with the right focus, I'm confident that we can turn this business around. I look at Kingsford at this year's Cat Litter, if you allow me to make that comparison. And we had a similar discussion a while ago on Cat Litter and what we said is that we understand the issues and we're moving swiftly. We will be focused on earning consumers back and not buying consumers back and stay disciplined, and that's exactly what we're doing. And as you know, litter today is one of our star performers. And we need to get Kingsford back on track, but the team is focused and I expect us to do better.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Benno.","Lisah Burhan - The Clorox Co.","Take the next question. Operator, are you still there?","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steve Powers [Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.].","Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","You guys there?","Lisah Burhan - The Clorox Co.","Yes.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Hi, Steve.","Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Hey, Lisa; hey, Benno, Kevin. Can you just remind size for us, especially with the incremental pricing that you've announced or talked about today? Just what percentage of your domestic portfolio you've now taken price on and what percentage in aggregate you now plan to take price on over the course of the fiscal year?","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Sure, Steve. This is Kevin. What we communicated back in August is that we'd be pricing about 50% of our portfolio. Through Q1, we've now priced approximately 35% of our portfolio. And as both myself and Benno mentioned, we will be executing pricing actions on our Burt's Bees and Charcoal business, which will take effect in our third quarter, which would really complete the full 50% of the portfolio.","Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks so much. And then, I know upfront, in Lisa's comments, you talked about that both the pass-through and the competitive reaction to that pricing has generally been in line with expectation so far. But acknowledging it's still early days, just I'd love a little bit more commentary on that. Because from what we're seeing in the Nielsen data at least, it looks like you've been broadly successful in getting that pricing onto shelf, which is good.","But if we take a category like Cat Litter, for example, which I think was an early target for you on price or even bleach, the headline data would suggest competitors aren't necessarily following like-for-like, which has been costing you market share at least from volumetric perspective. So just a little bit more color around the reactions to your pricing that you've been seeing across categories. And then, any comments on Cat Litter or bleach specifically would be great as well? Thanks.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yes. So first a clarification. So market share in litter and bleach is up in both businesses, so I think that feels like an important clarification. But on the overall price activity, again, we characterize the progress to be really strong. Our sell-through is largely complete on the businesses that we've announced before, and we've now moved on to Burt's Bees and Kingsford, which is underway.","Consumption, as you stated, Steve, going in line with expectation or slightly better. If I look at Cat Litter, we grew volume on Cat Litter and we grew on top, frankly, of a very strong year ago and we grew sales significantly in the double-digits. I would also point to Home Care, where we took pricing on a number of businesses. We grew share last month. The Toilet Bowl Cleaner business is one example where we took pricing and sales \u2013 volume on those two businesses is up double-digits.","So this is an activity that plays out across the fiscal year. We certainly went out ahead of competitors, as I think many of you have duly noted. We leaned into pricing and implemented it quickly based on the strength of our brand portfolio. And perhaps greater confidence in our ability to execute and execute quickly, and the strong analytics capability that we have. And we're now starting to see some competitors follow, whether that's in litter or that's in Home Care. And this will play out throughout the fall and throughout the fiscal year. We're playing the long game here.","But clearly out of the gate, pricing execution and progress is strong. You can see that from the added pricing on Kingsford and in Burt's Bees, and we feel good about where we are. And it's also key reason why we remain confident that we'll grow gross margins in the back half; reminding everybody that much of the positive impact we'll see from pricing is going to materialize in the second half of the fiscal year.","And as others perhaps are working through pricing increase discussions with retailers, as we speak, what we are able to do largely is to move on and talk to retailers about strong branding investments for the back half which will include, as we've mentioned, strong innovation plans. And certainly pricing helps us to continue to invest in the strategy that has yielded terrific returns for shareholders to-date and that we continue to have confidence in.","So this will play out through the rest of the fiscal year. And out of the gate, we're strong and that's part of why we've been able to mitigate most of the incremental costs and negative currency impact that we've seen over the last quarter. So, so far so good.","Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's great. And if I could just talk on one little follow-on question. Just as that pricing rolls out, I know that the time to order on most of your categories is very quick, relatively fast turns, but is there any lumpiness that we should be cognizant of throughout the fiscal year as you roll in this price? Any increased order in the first quarter, for example, to get ahead of future price increases? Or as we think about the pricing to come, any cadence of sale that maybe impacted by retailers getting ahead of planned pricing?","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Yeah, Steve. What I would expect to see, this will just build throughout the year, so I'd say sequentially better. You saw in Q1 we had about 90 basis points of gross margin accretion from pricing. Usually expect to see that continue to build through the year as we continue to roll out the pricing.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","And specifically on Q1, we have not commented on any forward buy playing a role here. If anything, we've seen a little headwind, perhaps 0.5 point or so, because we've been lapping a really strong hurricane-related sales in the last fiscal year. So this was a clean Q1.","Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Lisah Burhan - The Clorox Co.","We'll take the next question. Operator?","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thank you. Hi, everyone. I wanted to circle back with a follow-on question on the changes that you're making to your share buybacks. I guess, in general, I'm wondering how you're now thinking about creating value for shareholders? And how this might have changed whether you're now looking for other ways to do this, such as pursuing possible M&A opportunities? If you could touch on your current thoughts on this, I think it would be helpful.","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Sure, Bonnie. I'm happy to answer that question. I'd say a couple things. First, obviously, we won't comment on future M&A.","But as it relates to share buybacks, look, my priority is to make smart decisions for how we use the cash of our shareholders. If I was focused on EPS accretion as the primary objective, we would have done an ASR. And that's not what we're doing.","And so as I mentioned, we've got clear criteria internally that directs our behaviors, and we'll continue to follow that. And I think as you've seen the progress we've made to-date, we're being very disciplined about this program.","But again, EPS accretion is not my primarily objective here. It's making sure we make good, smart decisions of how we return our investors' cash.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then, if I may, just a couple quick questions on your advertising spend. I'm just wondering how quickly you expect it to ramp up, since you're guiding for a pretty decent chunk this fiscal year, the 10% as a percentage of sales, up from I guess 9.3% last year.","And then given that your organic sales growth guidance in the year is pretty much in line with your performance last year, I mean could you guys talk a little bit about the lag I guess you're expecting in terms of trying to drive possibly faster top line growth from some of the stepped-up spend? Thanks.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah, Bonnie. So as we commented in the past, so we're not making any comments as far as quarterly spend is concerned. We've always said that there's going to be a quarterly variation. What we have said is that our innovation plans this fiscal year are skewed towards the back half. So that should tell you something. But we maintain the guidance of about 10% for fiscal year.","I'll also tell you that we don't measure the success of our advertising sales promotion in quarterly volume. These are strategic investments, long-term investments. And frankly, the bulk of the value in strategic advertising and sales promotion investments reach well past a 12 months' timeframe.","So I'd be hard-pressed to compare a quarterly advertising sales promotional spend to quarterly sales, because it just doesn't necessarily work that way.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That is really helpful. Thank you.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Thank you, Bonnie.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. I have a couple questions. First thing, which is on the Lifestyle business. If I've kind of backed into it correctly, it looks like Nutranext added about 19% to that division, which would suggest that you had volume up 16% and price mix of a negative 9%-ish. I'm just \u2013 those are some really, really big numbers. Lifestyle, I know can be a little bit choppy. There's periods you've had kind of high-single digit volume, but nothing like this.","So anything in there with regard that's significant new distribution? Any kind of buy-in ahead of price increases? It's just the numbers are very, very large. I just would appreciate some greater information beyond what Lisah was able to share in the prepared remarks.","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Hi, Lauren. This is Kevin. Let me give you a couple thoughts and certainly welcome Benno to join as well. I'd say, obviously, overall Nutranext was the biggest contributor. And it's interesting when you look at our volume growth versus sales, and it's not necessarily intuitive, Nutranext has a lower revenue per case. So there's a bit of a negative mix on the top line. But it's margin accretive to the company.","So that's something you'll see going forward. As Nutranext continues to grow, it'll be a hit to the sales versus volume, but it's certainly margin accretive for the company. So we feel great about the growth of Nutranext.","And then maybe more broadly on the segment, I'm pleased to say we had low to mid-single digits growth across the entire portfolio. So every business grew. So good, strong performance in our Lifestyle segment this quarter.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","The low to mid-single digit growth on the rest of portfolio, that's a sales number or a volume number?","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Sales number, Lauren.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. On Nutranext, just thinking about relative to your other acquisition with RenewLife and some of the supply chain issues you've had there, anything you're doing differently with Nutranext to make sure with this very strong growth you don't kind of end up in the same situation you've been in with RenewLife, where you've now got to kind of build back up your shelf space, given the out of stock?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. That's a good question, Lauren, and good afternoon to you. So obviously that's something we're thinking about a lot. And the best thing I can say here is that the issue that we're facing on RenewLife really are not related in any way to Nutranext. So it's a separate business, it's a separate supply chain.","But clearly what I would tell you is that the ordering patterns that we've seen on RenewLife and perhaps also the changes that we've made to our supply chain as part of the integration give us good learning. If anything, it's not learning that we necessarily like, but we take it knowing that RenewLife is a solid business with a lot of potential and momentum in the fastest-growing subsegment, which is e-commerce.","But really two separate cases. And Nutranext, the integration is fully on track. We're seeing strong performance from the strategic brands that we bought, some growing double-digits and full speed ahead on Nutranext. And again, nothing that happens on RenewLife will have an impact on Nutranext in any way.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And I know it's been asked a few times, but I can't help but revisit Charcoal, right? So in the fourth quarter you cut advertising and merchandising support very, very significantly.","One quarter later, a business that's historically strong that you have innovated against, that you have had news flow on is down double-digit.","So can we just talk about why those two things aren't related? I mean you're sort of suggesting that there's something else going on. It's not because we cut. I mean, you had merchandising plans and you didn't follow through on them three months ago.","So I want to just go back through that thought process and maybe I'm missing something, that the Charcoal category had been weakening for some time. I'd just love \u2013 a little bit more detail there would be great.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. Thanks for clarifying. So I guess I'm less sure about your comment on we had merchandising plans, but didn't follow through on them. So as you know, retailers make merchandising decisions.","But clearly, what we'd seen in the business initially earlier this year was weather-related. And our expectation was that the business would come back. And now it hasn't. And we're seeing that coincide with lower household penetration.","I would be hard-pressed to associate that with one quarter advertising spending in particular, because again advertising spending works mostly in the long term.","I would say that household penetration is down perhaps more as a result of the overall brand building execution that has worked for so many years, which was to extend the grilling season and essentially focusing on a set of households and extending their consumption throughout the year.","We'll continue to do that because we continue to believe that there is a great value in that. But as an added focus, we will now turn our emphasis on adding households back. And much of our 2019 plans reflect that.","What we have said last quarter is that most of the 2018 grilling season is essentially shocked, and that's what we're seeing now. So what we're seeing is not inconsistent with what we've commented on last quarter. But our focus is on the 2019 grilling season and making sure that we bring new consumers into the category. And based on the work that we're seeing to-date, which includes new graphics, new advertising, meaningful innovation and the right merchandising plans with retailers, which we're working on, we should be able to get this business back.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Edge.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good morning. Thanks very much. So I guess e-commerce is planned to be about 8% still, and it was 6% last year. So that kind of gives us the rate. But can you tell us if and where there is interaction with the brick-and-mortar business? And maybe comment on any particular areas of strength and weakness. And just one quick one on share repurchase. Just being very bluntly, , how do you think about the level of share price when you make the share repurchase calculation and as part of your plans, not just now, but all the time? Thanks.","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Hi, Jonathan. This is Kevin. I'll answer the share repurchase question and turn it over to Benno. And in all reality, I won't share our internal criteria. We have clear criteria we follow, but it's not something we'll share publicly.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thank you.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. And then, I'll take the e-com question, Jonathan. So, obviously, feeling great about our progress in e-commerce. We have a lot of strong brands that work well in this channel. We're building strong capabilities. And importantly, as you know, the profitability also of the business is about in line with brick-and-mortar. So this is good.","Clearly, there's interaction between e-com and brick-and-mortar, but the incrementality is significant. We expect it to be north of 50%. Share growth is faster than in brick-and-mortar on practically all of our businesses. So we feel like the primary source of incremental sales is that we're gaining share from other brands.","The strength is really broad-based. There are certain businesses like Burt's Bees and Brita that have traditionally always done well because the consumer in those categories love to buy online. So we're seeing continued strength there. More recently, we're seeing strength from businesses like Cat Litter because it's certainly easier to order what are relatively heavy packs online, than to carry those packs home. And there's also a certain rhythm to the purchase of litter and trash bags for that matter, which makes these products really very suitable to subscription-based models.","But our strongest business, frankly, is probably our Professional business, where as a percentage of total sales e-com accounts for around 20% because a lot of the purchases that many institutional and professionals buyers make are now done online. So broad-based strength, a lot of room left, which is why we said that we're pretty confident that this business can meet and perhaps even exceed our original stretch target of $500 million in sales by 2020. And we expect significant portion of those incremental sales from north of $300 million last fiscal year to continue to be incremental.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. So I too have a couple questions. One is on working capital. It was up a lot from 1.5% of sales to 3.2% I guess in your supplemental here as a percent of sales. Is that Nutranext? Are you in any way extending terms from payments perspective or inventory loading? Can you just identify why that went up so much?","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Hi, Ali. Sure, I can take that one. And you're right, it's primarily Nutranext. They have a much higher working capital as a percent of sales rate. And certainly that's an opportunity for us as we begin to integrate that business. But that was the primary driver of the increase of working capital for the company.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. I want to go back to repurchase a little bit and the curtailing of it. There are typically two reasons why that happens. One is, your math suggests that it's expensive to buy the stock right now or your idea is that you want to save money from an M&A perspective to go make bigger acquisition. I just want to make sure I'm understanding correctly that's more the former than the latter?","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. Ali, as I've said, I obviously won't comment on future M&A. And as I also said we had very clear criteria. If you look back at our history, this is only the fourth open market share repurchase program we'd executed in the last two decades. And I think if you look at our previous results, we've been very disciplined in the way we execute those programs, and that's no exception for this program. We will continue to execute that discipline.","As I mentioned, when you look at our results for about 9% of our authorization, I feel very good about the choices we're making for our shareholders. And we'll continue to do that going forward. But I'm not going to (00:51:31) about this.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So what do you mean by discipline?","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Well, what I'd say, Ali, is obviously I'm investing my shareholders' cash and I'll be very thoughtful about how I do that. And I'm hopeful you can appreciate and understand what that means.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","That is clear. Last question is on pricing and a topic we talk about often in terms of the elasticity. Look, it's tough to tease it out and I understand if there's difficult compares here. But it doesn't look great that the volumes decelerate or even went negative in the segments where you took pricing. So looks like the elasticity are getting a little bit worse. If you could kind of dissuade me from that point of view that'd be helpful?","And aligned with that, historically, if you just look in terms of how much pricing you've taken relative to the commodity plus manufacturing and logistics costs, it's been about kind of 50% of an offset last year. And this year, it's much lower than that, kind of 18%-20% range. As you plan going forward, what percentage do you think you'll be able to offset in your gross margin through pricing? Is it back up to this 50% level? Thanks a lot.","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Maybe, Ali, I'll start with that question on gross margin impact to pricing and then I can turn over to Benno. If you look at our Q1 results and as you saw, we generate about 90 bps of benefit in the quarter from pricing; and that reflects fairly limited impacts from our initial pricing activity. Only litter is really in place for the entire quarter.","And so, as we continue to progress through the year and continue to execute our pricing actions, I would expect you'll start seeing a benefit 2x what you saw in the first quarter flowing through in the back half of the year. And so, when you start looking at that size benefit from pricing, plus the ongoing benefits of cost savings which tend to be 150 bps or so, you really I think can start to see in the back half of the year why we believe we'll be in a position to start rebuilding margins.","Maybe to that point, while you saw that we took our outlook down as it relates to gross margin for the year to about flat, I would tell you I'm personally much less concerned about the average for the year and much more focused on are we taking the right actions to put ourselves in a position to start rebuilding margins in the back of the year. And everything I'm seeing in terms of the progress on pricing and cost savings, I feel like we've positioned ourselves well to do that and it's really because we started executing pricing early. So I mean I've provided that perspective. And, Benno, if you want to talk about volume?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. Hi, Ali. Maybe just a few things to add. Obviously, we've always commented that temporarily there's going to be a negative volume impact from pricing as people adjust to new price points. That's something that we build in our estimates, that's something that we communicated previously, and that's largely playing out as planned. And then, after about 12 months, in particular once all the competitive reactions are through, that normalizes.","What I will tell you though that, again, it is not true that in the businesses that we've taken pricing, volume declines. Litter volume is up. Clorox toilet volume is up double-digits. Our premium trash bag, OdorShield, which as you know we care about a lot, volume is up. So just for the record, we grew volume 5%. International, the volume is up. So I just want to make sure that we have the right data and the right expectations here.","Feeling good about pricing, I want to reiterate that. But, importantly, feel good about the top line momentum that we have maintained in the face of pricing, which frankly if I compare it to our own models on those businesses that are out of the gate early, it's frankly slightly better than planned. And that's been very important as it has helped us to mitigate the additional cost increases that we've been seeing.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks. So clarifying, volume perhaps decelerating because there'll be some reaction from a pricing perspective but still tough?","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. Ali, maybe I would also add, a lot of times I hear folks talk about price mix, which I really think is only half the equation. When we take pricing, you should expect two impacts. One, we generate more revenue per case. The other one is because of the elasticity, there's a temporary pullback in volume as consumers adjust to the new pricing. We have a long history of taking pricing. And typically when we do that, we expect it to be fairly benign to the top line. And we're really doing it because it's helping offset the cost headwinds we're facing and improving gross profit. That's exactly how this is playing out, very much as we expected; that the offset of those two issues has very little impact on the top line, but it's clearly contributing, helping us offset our cost environment.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Steve Strycula of UBS.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, good afternoon. Benno, quick question as the world moves more online. How do we think about the percentage of your transactions that are done online are single incidence purchases versus building towards more of a subscription or annuity-like model? And then, I have a follow-up.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. Steve, good question. I think that varies by business. There are certain businesses where there's less of a cadence, where it's more one-off purchases. And disinfecting wipes may be a good example where the majority of the purchases are single transactions, and then there are other businesses where we're seeing more of a natural rhythm. And I mentioned Cat Litter earlier, but certainly also vitamins and minerals and supplements business and Brita, where subscription-based models are very attractive.","At this point, most of our sales are single transactions. But, clearly, we're interested in subscriptions; and in a number of businesses, we're seeing those increase. I cannot tell you where this is going; I don't think anybody can. But what I can tell you is that if and as this becomes a more important part of the e-com business, we're positioning ourselves to be a company that will benefit from it.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then, a follow-up maybe for Lisah, I suppose. What would the volume be on organic basis for the total company and for the Household or the Lifestyle division, excluding M&A? Thanks.","Lisah Burhan - The Clorox Co.","You're asking Lifestyle or total company? So I think, Kevin in his earlier commentary made a comment that excluding Nutranext, Lifestyle would have grown in the high-single digits in volume.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Yeah, in the total company, if you have it. Thank you.","Lisah Burhan - The Clorox Co.","For total company, we report on our sales. So we are not commenting on volume. But if you do the math, organic volume on a total company basis still grew.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jason English of Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, good afternoon, folks, and happy Halloween.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Hi, Jason.","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Hey, Jason.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","A quick question for you on just the gross margin walk, the logistics in manufacturing leakage was a lot bigger than we were expecting, certainly bigger than we saw last year. And actually looking back over a decade of history, the biggest we've seen in 10 years. Can you unpack that for us? Let us understand what the drivers are and what your expectations are going forward for that line item?","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Sure, Jason, I can provide a little perspective on margin. I would say, generally gross margin came in about where we expected. If you recall back in August my comments, the expectation was this would be our most difficult comp, we've seen our gross margin under pressure for about six quarters now, with the exception of Q1 last year, which it actually grew about 50 bps. And so, we knew this would be a tough comp. Also keep in mind, last year, we really started to see the run-up in both commodity and transportation costs, really November, December. So we knew first four, five months of the year would be more difficult.","There's a couple of areas where I'd say it came in a little higher than anticipated, there are really two. The first is, we are seeing some wage inflation higher than we anticipated. That'll play out through the year, although that's not too material. The other one though was more of a choice we made. We did make some different set of choices around transportation, and that had about a 20 to 30 bp hit in Q1.","And if you think about our transportation environment, we move product one of two ways, either by rail, which tends to be a bit slower and cheaper; or we move it by truck, that tends to be faster, but more expensive. And because of some of the strength we saw in Q1, particularly on litter and Home Care, business was a bit stronger than we anticipated. We had to make a different decision to move some of that product from rail to truck to expedite its moves to make sure we could keep up with demand, and that added a little bit of headwinds to the first quarter.","I don't worry too much about that. We can adjust inventory levels to ensure that doesn't happen going forward. And so, that was sort of how I think about Q1. And then, my expectation is, as we go forward, we will continue to see sequential improvement in gross margin. And I still believe we're on track to start expanding gross margins in the back half of the year.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's helpful, thanks. And my second and last question, and I'll pass it on, it comes back to penetration. Benno, you've touted your success on penetration for the last couple of years. And clearly it's emerged as a bit of a headwind in Kingsford.","But as we're looking at the penetration data from the panel databases at Nielsen, it looks like it's become a bit more widespread. In fact, looking just at your top seven brands, penetration has begun to wane from the 2016 or 2015 peak, with most of that weakness starting to mount this year.","Can you give us any \u2013 well, first, is that consistent, inconsistent with what you see in your own databases? And if consistent, can you give us any context to what's driving that? And whether or not we should be alarmed that maybe this is an early indicator of what's to come, like we saw in Kingsford?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","No, you should not be alarmed, Jason. The majority of our brands continues to have either stable or growing household penetration. 15 out of 22 brands are stable or growing.","And we're able to measure also what will happen post price increases, and we're pretty confident in our ability to continue to drive household penetration in an effective way. The best way, of course, for us to do that is to continue to invest in our brands. And what we've commented on is our commitment to invest at the about 10% of sales level this fiscal year.","And the second key strategy, of course, is innovation. And we have commented on the fact that we have a lot of very meaningful innovation coming out in our brands in the back half of the fiscal year in practically all of our major businesses.","So, no, household penetration at Clorox remains strong and alive and we're committed to it. And we're also transparent enough to declare when one business perhaps is falling off a cliff a little bit and what that allows us to do, as you will hopefully have noted is to address it and address it aggressively and address it quickly. And then hold ourselves accountable to making improvements again so that Kingsford can join the large number of brands in our stable that have solid household penetration results back again in the next year.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, thank you, and hello, everyone. So I have a follow-up on pricing and competitive dynamics. Benno, you spoke about pricing by some of your competitors, but I'm assuming that is mostly the branded ones. Can you also talk about private label and how you're seeing the price gaps of your brands against private label, if they haven't widened too much or because you've done selective price packs?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah, too early to say, Andrea. I think at the end of next quarter, we'll have a better view on what private label will do. So clearly right now, out of the gate, I'd perhaps mention bleach as one example, liquid bleach, where private label has not followed, but we're growing market share.","So that perhaps should tell you that we have modeled pricing the right way. We have not assumed in our fiscal year guidance in our modeling for all competitors, including private label, to follow at all times. And what we're seeing right now in terms of competitive reaction even early out of the gate is about in line with what we had expected. So I think we just need to continue to play this out.","The one additional comment I'd make is, have we dealt back? No, we have actually not dealt back at all. And I think we've commented in the past and we'll continue to take the position that it is not our intention to deal back. We'll certainly stay agile and monitor what's happening in the marketplace.","But as an piece of evidence on how serious we are about not dealing back is that in Q1 of fiscal year 2019, our trade spend actually was lower than in Q1 of fiscal year 2018, as we've continued to be able to optimize how we spend. So no intention to deal back. And pricing, including price gaps, are performing about in line with our plans.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And on Lifestyle, just a follow-up, we're trying to do the math just discussed by Kevin. So if you do the clarification that you had, is the organic growth there was high-single digits, right? And then, earlier I believe the commentary was the organic business in Lifestyles were up low-single digits to mid-single digit, which implied the pricing was down.","So was that primarily on Brita? Or there are some price reductions on Burt's Bees ahead of the list prices? I'm just trying to reconcile that comment.","Lisah Burhan - The Clorox Co.","Hey, Andrea. Linking back to Benno's comment, price mix, to you guys' definition, is positive across all segments. All four segments have some positive price mix.","Now in Lifestyle, I hope it's clear, but we said volume excluding Nutranext, or organic volume, is high-single digits, pretty strong. And sales would have been in the mid-single digits without Nutranext.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Good afternoon, everyone. Benno, I was hoping you can talk about, there's always been this debate on leading brands, private label, tertiary brands. And it just seems like now with availability of big data and AI and the like, retailers are realizing that certain brands should have more space and maybe some of those third, fourth, fifth tier brands should have less space or not be on the shelf at all. And I know that's been an ongoing thing. But it looks like it's starting to accelerate.","So I was hoping you can provide a little bit of context, especially in the context of private label and how much rhetoric is coming out of the retail community regarding private label? Thank you.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Nik. So we look at what's going on at retail and especially who's going at retail as a significant potential tailwind for our company.","If you think about who is growing, they're limited assortment channels, right? So whether that's club or smaller stores, that Walmart's drive-in or drug, et cetera, dollar, what these stores are trying to accomplish is offer a wide assortment, meaning all categories. But less and less they will offer number three, four, five brands, right?","So they will lean into market leaders, which they need for sales growth and to get people into the store, and they need private label. And then number three, four, five brands are squeezed out.","And given that our portfolio is more than 80% in number one and two share brand, we believe that we can significantly benefit from that in the future. And we also believe that we are significantly benefiting from that today.","And the evidence of that, of course, is the strength of our business in non-tracked channels. Many of the stores that you talk about, which lean on market leaders and private label are in non-tracked channels. And our growth in those channels continues to significantly outpace that of tracked channels. So tailwind for us. It's happening as we speak.","But as consumers vote with their money to spend more and more money in non-tracked channels, we believe that it continues to be a tailwind for us. And it's certainly more efficient for retailers. And typically where retailers consolidate to market leaders and private label, that works well for their top line and for their bottom line.","And as you know that we're category captains in most of the categories that we're in and with most retailers that we're in. And as we work with retailers on making assortment recommendations, we're certainly making sure that they have the same understanding of the data and the potential for the sales and profits that this polarization in the marketplace offers to them.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. And if I could just ask a quick question on M&A, you could just remind us all on kind of your focus right now in M&A, your priorities, and what the valuation landscape looks like right now. It seems to be a little bit more favorable today than maybe it was a year or two years ago?","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. Thanks Nik for the question. On M&A, nothing's really changed. We continue to have strategic spaces that we've identified that we continue to look for opportunities. As you can imagine, I won't necessarily comment on anything specific, but nothing's really changed in terms of our openness to M&A. But as we've said many times, we feel very good about the portfolio we have, the strength of our base business. And if the right deal comes along at the right price, we're certainly open, but don't feel any pressure to have to deal. And I'd say nothing has changed in that regard.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Olivia Tong of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks. Want to talk about price. And when you consider where to price and by how much, obviously raw materials is a big factor in that, but I'd be curious on how you get to a price increase plan. Specifically, I'm thinking about Charcoal because you mentioned about a third of the pricing is now in place, your approach in Charcoal to go. But how do you go about doing this and how do you think about relative success in a category where your business has been down a lot? Thanks.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah Olivia, good afternoon. You were breaking up a little bit, but I think if I understood your question correctly, is sort of our general approach to pricing and criteria that go into this, is that correct?","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's correct. And then, just in terms of Charcoal, how you went about deciding on your price increase in Charcoal, given the challenges that you've seen in the business?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah, yeah. Thank you for that. So on pricing, clearly costs play a significant role, and this is a good opportunity. As a reminder that it's not the short-term costs, but it is midterm cost plateaus that we priced towards, which means that you can't always price toward short-term peaks. But the considerations while cost is the most important one that go into pricing decisions are the competitive environment, the strength of our innovation plans, is the value that we offer as expressed in the consumer value measure and, as a result, also the price sensitivity analytics that we have for every single brand.","And then, we develop various scenarios and we pick the scenario that optimizes long-term business health and our ability to stem these short-term headwinds. Certainly, our intention to understand certain price points is important too as we make pricing decisions, but mostly driven by a solid cost-justified business case. That protects our ability to invest in the business, because as you all know well and Charcoal follows the same rhythm. Obviously, we have a lot of confidence in the Charcoal business long-term and in our 2019 plans and the price increase that we're taking now, which is going to be effective in December of this calendar year, allows us to make the strong investments that we need to turn this business around. And it's also a reflection of the strong value that consumers see in Charcoal.","So pretty strategic approach to pricing, knowing that doing nothing at this point is not an option, we price as a way to help us continue to make strategic and long-term investments to create shareholder value, investments in innovation, investments in brand building plans that engage consumers, and investments in the growth in all channels with retailers. And the good news is that on most of our businesses, we're through pricing discussions and we're now back in the business of discussing how we can grow retailer categories and how we can maximize the impact of our innovation in the back half.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. That's helpful. And then, if I can just follow-up on a prior question around trucking logistics. Obviously, that number was a fair bit higher than we had anticipated. And you had mentioned two different things with that, wage inflation which sounds like it's clearly not just a one-quarter phenomenon; and then, the choice to move to truck rather than rail to keep up with demand. I would imagine that that is more of a shorter-term thing. So as we think about modeling for the remainder of the year, how do you think about trucking logistics? I would imagine that it goes down a little bit from that high watermark that you saw in Q1, but still pretty elevated as the year progresses?","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Yeah, Olivia. Thanks for the question. I would say that's the right way to think about it. Obviously, as I mentioned, the most difficult comps are probably the first four or five months of the year where you see outsized increases year-over-year. And then, as we start lapping that comp, you'll start to see a lower increase. If I just step back and think about the transportation market, last year we saw rate increases of roughly 15% to 20%. This year, back in August, I had identified our expectation were rate increases closer to 5% to 10%. I would tell you that's about where it seems to be playing out, still early in the year, but still an inflationary market, but to a lower degree. So as we progress through the year, I would expect to see logistics being a smaller impact year-over-year as we go.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thank you.","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Sure.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Thank you, Olivia.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Dorer, I would now like to turn the conference back to you.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. Thank you all again for joining us today.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Steve Austenfeld, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Mr. Austenfeld, you may begin your conference.","Steven Austenfeld - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining Clorox's third quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, Colorx's CEO, and Steve Robb, our Chief Financial Officer. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com.","Let me remind you that on today's call we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures including, but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt-to-EBITDA and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the Financial Results area of our website, as well as in our filings with the SEC. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release.","Please recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements.

The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.","So with that, I'll start by covering highlights of our third quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our financial results and updated financial outlook for fiscal year 2015. And finally, Benno will provide his perspective, and then we will open it up for your questions.","Please recognize that all of today's commentary is on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise stated.","Turning to our top-line results, in Q3 volume was up 1% and sales grew 3%, including the impact of 2 points of unfavorable foreign currencies, with the largest impact coming from Argentina, Canada and Australia. Excluding the impact of foreign currencies, sales grew 5%. Our growth reflects higher volume and favorable mix as well as a nearly 3-point benefit from price increases. Importantly, our sales results reflect growth across all U.S. segments and international on a currency-neutral basis.","In Q3, our U.S. 13-week market shares increased three-tenths of a point versus the year-ago quarter. This is the largest market share increase in the past four years and reflects share growth in six of our eight tracked categories.","Our third quarter increase reflected strong gains in our Home Care and Laundry businesses, with Clorox Disinfecting Wipes and Clorox liquid bleach leading the way. Brita, Glad, Charcoal and Burt's Bees also grew market share in the quarter. Conversely, we saw market share declines in our cat litter business as competitive intensity remained high.","To address the challenges in our Litter business, we continue to drive our new lightweight product, along with harder-hitting advertising and packaging claims on our overall Fresh Step business. In addition, we have innovation coming out in the cat litter category that we anticipate will result in improved share trends in calendar year 2016.","Looking at our U.S. categories, they were up 2 points in the third quarter, a strong improvement following the 0.5 gain we saw in Q1 and more than 1 point gain that we saw in Q2. We are continuing to invest to improve our category trends, and strengthening our market shares remains a top priority.","With that, I'll review our third quarter results by segment. In our Cleaning segment, Q3 volume grew 1% primarily due to strong results in our Home Care business. Sales also grew 1% with gains across all Cleaning segment businesses.","In Home Care, which is our largest U.S. business unit, sales increased 1% behind strong execution of merchandising events, particularly for Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, along with strong performance of new wipes with micro-scrubbers that we began shipping at the start of the fiscal year. While it's too early to get a definitive read on performance, sales also benefited from the launch of three new products: Clorox ScrubSingles, Clorox Triple Action Dust Wipes and Clorox Pump 'N Clean.","Our Professional Products business grew sales 3% in the third quarter, particularly behind increased shipments in our food service channel. As we discussed last quarter, following double-digit Q2 sales growth behind Ebola and enterovirus concerns, we anticipated some slowdown in third quarter Professional Products growth as those concerns abated. Looking ahead, we anticipate our Professional Products business will continue to grow faster than the company average.","In our Laundry business, sales increased 1% due to growth from Clorox liquid bleach and Clorox 2 Stain Fighter & Color Booster. As noted last quarter, due to increased input costs we implemented a 7% average price increase on Clorox bleach, effective February 1. The price increase was well executed in the market. However, competitors have been somewhat slow to follow. From a market share standpoint, our strong execution is paying off as Q3 marked the fifth consecutive quarter of market share growth on Clorox bleach.","In our Household segment, volume was flat while sales increased 5%. The segment's top-line results were driven by strong performance in our Charcoal businesses, which grew volume and sales at a double-digit rate on top of high-single-digit growth in the year-ago quarter. Charcoal's strong top-line results were driven by converting to a new and improved lightweight product that began shipping in January, supported by increased demand-building investments as well as strong early-season performance at key retailers.","Our Bags and Wraps business grew sales 1%, driven by innovation behind the new Gain scented trash bags through our partnership with Procter & Gamble. Volume on Glad declined 9%, reflecting the impact of price increases taken last March and November on our trash bag business.","Although competition has not yet followed, we continue to believe our pricing actions are right for the long term with signs the resin market is firming up. In addition, we anticipate reinvesting a portion of our pricing benefit in trade spending to manage price gaps and to invest in innovation on our premium lines of business.","Cat Litter volume and sales decreased 3% and 2%, respectively, in the face of competitive activity. We're continuing to invest aggressively in innovation and communicating our value proposition versus the competition, particularly focusing on excellent clumping and odor control such as with Fresh Step's eliminate-odor-for-10-days claim that comes with a money-back guarantee.","In our Lifestyle segment, volume grew 2% while sales grew 3%. These results were driven by high-single-digit sales growth on Burt's Bees, largely due to innovation in lip and face care products. In particular, our new lip crayons grew strongly in the quarter, supported by new Burt's Bees television advertising, as did our renewal of face line, facial towelettes and skin brightening products.","Looking to the fourth quarter, sales growth will likely be well within year ago as we lap the strong merchandising and pipeline build for the lip crayon products. Full-year results for Burt's Bees continue to track to high-single-digit growth, and we look forward to another strong year in fiscal 2016.","Turning to our Food business, volume grew 1% and sales grew 2% versus the year-ago quarter behind higher volume of bottled and dry Hidden Valley products, including the February launch of five new flavored Hidden Valley Ranch dressings and two new Greek yogurt dry dip and dressing mixes. Partially offsetting the Burt's Bees and Food gains where lower sales and shipments of Water Filtration products due to category softness and intense competition in pour-through filters.","As previously communicated, we started shipping an improved Brita filter in August. It is faster and easier to change than competitive filters and is getting strong reviews in e-commerce channels. In November, we began shipping improved pitchers. We're keenly focused on getting our consumer messaging right and, coupled with our focus on innovation, we're optimistic that our Water Filtration business will improve in fiscal year 2016.","Turning to International, volume was up 1% and sales were flat, reflecting the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of foreign currencies, sales for International grew 10%. In the quarter, International saw market share gains in Canada in local currency terms and we grew volume share in Latin America, particularly in bleach and cleaners.","As we discussed last quarter, we continue to see slowing economic growth in some of our key markets such as Chile and Peru, given macroeconomic trends such as high inflation and slow GDP growth.","That said, we remain committed to growing profitably in our International markets as we continue to carefully assess spending across geographies and implement price increases to partially mitigate the macroeconomic headwinds.","Looking at the balance of fiscal year 2015, as noted in this morning's press release we've increased our sales growth outlook for the year to be in a range of 1% to 2%. The revised sales outlook takes into account the strength seen year-to-date.","For the fourth quarter, we continue to anticipate strong foreign exchange headwinds along with higher trade spending to support our categories and grow market shares, as well as to defend against reduced prices by competitors.","Now I'll turn it over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our Q3 financial performance and updated financial outlook for fiscal year 2015.","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Steve. And welcome, everyone. We're pleased to have delivered another good quarter, following a solid first half of fiscal 2015. As you saw in our press release, given our results to date we've raised our fiscal year outlook for sales and updated earnings per share from continuing operations.","Now we'll turn to our financial results for the quarter. In our third quarter, sales grew 3%, reflecting 3 points of pricing, a little over 1 point of favorable mix and assortment, and nearly a point of volume growth. These factors were partially offset by 2 points of unfavorable foreign exchange and 1 point of higher trade spending.","On a currency-neutral basis, sales grew 5%. Gross margin for the quarter increased 110 basis points to 43.2%, reflecting 170 basis points of cost savings and 140 basis points of pricing benefit. These factors were partially offset by 120 basis points of increased manufacturing and logistics costs and about 60 basis points of higher performance-based incentive compensation cost.","For the quarter, commodity costs were about flat. Selling and administrative expenses increased 16% in the third quarter to 14.7% of sales compared to 13% of sales in the year-ago quarter. This increase was driven primarily by a significantly higher performance-based compensation costs reflecting higher anticipated year-over-year payouts, which recognizes the company's strong performance to date.","While the largest impact from higher incentive compensation costs was reflected in selling and administrative expenses, it also resulted in higher cost of goods sold and research and development expenses. Importantly, for the full fiscal year, we continue to anticipate that selling and administrative expenses to be about 14% of sales, consistent with our long-term target.","Advertising and sales promotion investment for the quarter was nearly 9% of sales, with U.S. spending for the quarter at about 10% of sales, reflecting continued strong support for our U.S. businesses. Net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.08, a $0.06 decrease versus the year-ago quarter due largely to the higher year-over-year incentive compensation costs. As a reminder, in the year-ago period earnings had a $0.12 benefit due to unusually low incentive compensation costs; again, consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy.","Fiscal year-to-date free cash flow was $398 million compared with $357 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 11%. In keeping with our practice to return excess cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases, fiscal year to date the company has repurchased about 1.5 million shares of common stock at a cost of approximately $158 million.","Now I'll turn to our updated outlook for fiscal year 2015.","As Steve mentioned, we raised our fiscal year sales outlook, which now anticipates sales growth in the range of 1% to 2%, reflecting stronger results to date and an impact of more than 2 percentage points from unfavorable foreign currencies. Our sales outlook also reflects slowing international economies, increased trade spending as we continue to support our brands.","Turning to margin, we continue to anticipate moderate gross margin expansion for the fiscal year as the benefit of cost savings and pricing are expected to more than offset higher manufacturing and logistics costs. We also continue to anticipate that commodity costs will be about flat for the full year as year-to-date headwinds should be offset by lower commodity costs in the fourth quarter. As I previously mentioned, we continue to anticipate selling and administrative expenses at about 14% of sales.","EBIT margin is expected to be about flat, reflecting moderate gross margin expansion offset by higher performance-based incentive compensation costs. Our fiscal year EBIT margin also reflects incremental demand-building investments.","We continue to anticipate fiscal 2015 tax rate on earnings from continuing operations to be about 34%. And net of all of these factors, we have updated our fiscal year outlook for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to $4.45 to $4.55.","As we look ahead to fiscal year 2016, we're going to be keenly focused on three things. First, headwinds in international markets, including slowing economies and foreign currency declines, which we anticipate to be higher than this year's expected level of more than 2% and will impact both top- and bottom-line results. In particular, we anticipate a meaningful currency devaluation in Argentina sometime in fiscal year 2016.","Second, we continue to monitor changes in commodity costs. Despite the current softness in resin prices, we're seeing early signs that the market may be firming up. In addition, logistics costs remain high, which will likely continue into next year.","And third, we will invest heavily in our brands. As I mentioned previously, historically we've invested a portion of the resin-related savings back into the business. In particular, we anticipate continuing to invest in trade promotion, especially in categories where competitors have yet to follow our pricing actions. As a reminder, we will provide our outlook for fiscal year 2016 in early August.","In closing, I feel really good about our results this quarter despite the headwinds we continue to face. We continue to be encouraged by the actions we're taking to accelerate growth in our U.S. businesses and plan to continue investing. In addition, our team drove operational efficiencies that allowed us to expand our margins, which supports our focus on driving profitable growth.","With that, I will turn it over to Benno.","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Steve, and hi, everyone. We're pleased to have delivered strong third quarter results on top of a very solid first half. As we've shared with you, the central aspect of our 2020 strategy is to drive profitable growth. And consistent with that strategy, while facing significant foreign exchange headwinds and cost increases, in Q3 we focused on growing profitably through strong execution of our Desire, Decide and Delight demand-building model based on delivering better value to consumers; through launching meaningful innovations across many categories; increasing brand investments in the U.S.; delivering strong cost savings; and executing price increases where they are justified.","As a result, we drove category and overall market share improvements and saw further revitalization of our U.S. retail business. We generated stronger top-line results. We expanded gross margin. And we raised our sales outlook and updated our EPS outlook for the fiscal year.","Now as we look ahead to fiscal year 2016, I remain confident in our strategy and our keen focus on accelerating profitable growth to create value for our stockholders. The strategy accelerators I shared with you last quarter are driving decisions around where we will invest more heavily; again, with the intent to drive profitable growth.","By accelerating portfolio momentum, we're taking advantage of tailwinds to generate more growth from our portfolio and invest more heavily against those brands and categories that have a stronger right to grow. We're pleased to see this reflected in our Q3 share growth, which was the strongest we've seen in four years.","By accelerating 3D technology transformation, we're addressing the shift in how today's consumers shop and buy their products and how we must engage with them. As we focus on winning the battle for the physical and virtual shopping cart, we've solidified partnerships with key retailer partners to accelerate our e-commerce strategy.","By accelerating innovation across our demand-creation model of Desire, Decide and Delight, we are driving category growth. I'm pleased with the progress we're making. And this quarter, we launched meaningful innovation across several categories. Although early days, several of these are exceeding expectations.","And finally, by accelerating our growth culture while maintaining operational excellence, we're driving an even more deeply-ingrained growth mindset. I believe these are the right strategies, particularly as we manage our business in the face of challenges that Steve Robb noted earlier: slowing economies in international markets and strong foreign exchange headwinds, a volatile commodity market, and the need to continue to invest in trade promotions to support our brands against competition.","And with that, we'll open it up to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Dorer. Our first question will come from Steve Powers of UBS.","Steve R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Hi, Benno, Steve, and Steve. I wanted to ask a question around the gross margin guidance, Steve. I'm not sure how you define moderate expansion. But if I take your full-year guidance of 1% to 2% in the top line and assume, just as a starting point, Q4 gross margin looks like Q3 in terms of expansion, that's going to put your gross margin performance for the year up about 40 basis points, if my math is correct. So I guess first does 40 basis points line up as moderate for you? And then second, is there any reason why gross margin expansion shouldn't actually accelerate in Q4, given the magnitude of the presumed commodity benefits and the continued cost saves?","I know you flagged the higher trade promotion in your outlook a couple of times. And I'm assuming that's particularly focused on Glad, where you've got the price gap issue. But just how significant a spike in gross to net are you expecting in Q4, if you can size that order of magnitude versus Q3? Thanks.","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. We are expecting a meaningful improvement in gross margins in the fourth quarter. Obviously, we're very pleased with the results we saw in the third quarter where we added almost a little over a full point of gross margin. And what we saw in the third quarter, and this is relevant to the fourth quarter, strong cost-savings programs, pricing actions that are working in the market.","In the third quarter, commodity costs were flat. And so all those benefits flowed through. When you look forward to the fourth quarter, we feel great about the pricing. We feel very good about the cost savings. And importantly, we expect to get some commodity cost tailwinds, okay, and that will probably be the first quarter this year where we're actually getting tailwinds, so I would expect a meaningful gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter.","Now for the full year, stepping back, we do expect EBIT margin to be about flat. And the reason for that is we are going to continue to step up our investments in consumer demand-building investments, and our SG&A costs are expected to be about 14% for the full year. So I think some of the benefit in the fourth quarter in gross margin will be offset by some of these other factors, but nonetheless you should see some pretty nice numbers.","Steve R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","And I guess just to square that with moderate expansion and in terms of language of your outlook, if you're up meaningfully in the fourth quarter, sounds like at least as much as the third quarter, that's 50 basis points or so. That's going to be a sizeable \u2013 is that what you define as moderate gross margin expansion?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Steve, I'll let you do your math. I'll let you apply your judgment. Keep in mind, the first half was a bit more challenging for us. Second half, as we expected, gross margins are expected to do better. We're seeing it in the third quarter. We'll see it again in the fourth quarter. And I think, again, for the year you're going to see some good margin expansion at the gross margin line, but EBIT margins should be about flat.","Steve R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And is there any way to frame or \u2013 Steve mentioned a couple of times increasing trade spends. You got increasing investments throughout the press release. You talk about higher trade promotion in your outlook. You flagged the price gap issue in Glad. So how much incremental investment should we be thinking about relative to the Q3 run rate as we look forward on that trade promo line?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, let me step back and just talk about the full year for a second in long term. First, you might recall that on our 2020 strategy, one of the things that we wanted to do was to invest in incremental point of sales in consumer demand-building investment and to some extent in R&D. We started that in the fourth quarter of last year. I think we've continued it through this year. So I think what you should expect is a mix of both trade spending as we're looking to drive trial and repeat on new products, as well as just advertising as we keep those brands healthy. But I think you'll see us consistently do this over the coming quarters. But again, full year you should see a nice increase, consistent with what you've seen year to date.","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And Steve, this is Benno. One thing I would add is that you should see the incremental dollars probably float around depending on where they deliver the ROI, depending on the strategic needs at any given point. Right now, it's fair to say that more dollars go into trade promotion, one, to support the price increases, but two, also to support fast distribution startup behind what is a really solid innovation program. Over time, that might change and the dollars might go into different buckets. But as Steve Robb said, this increase in spend is going to be here to stay and in line with our strategies.","Steve R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll hear next from Jason English from Goldman Sachs.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good afternoon, folks. Thank you for the question. I wanted to focus on your International business quickly. I know you've made a lot of investments in the recent years or taken a lot steps, I should say, in recent years to try to improve the profitability \u2013 walking away from Venezuela, the SAP investment. Yet looking at profitability I think from a margin perspective, this quarter marked a new all-time low.","So can you talk more \u2013 I know FX is a pressure point here, but from just a profitability perspective, what's driving the ongoing erosion? What can you do to maybe fix it, and what's a realistic expectation as we think about the forward there?","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Jason, thank you for that. Well, our long-term aspiration in International is to grow 5% to 7% in sales but importantly grow profitably. And it's fair to say that at this point we're not meeting those expectations. I would say that operationally we're executing well, but we all know this is a very challenging environment that will likely continue well into next fiscal year.","The key drivers, to your question, a lot of them are macroeconomic in nature around GDP, around cost inflation, price controls and FX. Again, these are factors that our peers are seeing as well, and they're pretty well established. Going forward, our focus will be on rebuilding margin. I'm not happy about the profitability, and rebuilding margin is our first priority.","I would point at a few key tactics. One, continued pricing to offset inflation. Two, innovation where margin accretive that drives trade up, and we're seeing good results behind tactics like this in markets like Argentina and there's more that we can and will do. Three, we will really be very disciplined about demand spending. We will spend where it is profitable and where we feel like there's going to be a long-term growth effect. We will not spend if the profitability is not there.","And then fourth, we have intensified our efforts to apply what we think is a solid playbook from the U.S. on the cost-savings side, and we will do more of that.","So going forward, I do not expect us to be on the growth trajectory, the 5% to 7% in sales growth that I mentioned earlier, any time soon. But I do think that we can do better to start rebuilding our margin, and that again will be our priority near term given all the challenges that are largely macroeconomic in nature.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. One follow-up and then another question. Some of the cost-relief benefits that you're expecting in the U.S., would you expect to see them in International as well, or is FX going to be a full offset?","And then real quick on top line, you bumped it from 1% to 1% to 2% for the year, with only one quarter left. That's a pretty wide range. It implies sort of down 2% to plus 2% for the fourth quarter. Plus 2% seems like it should be pretty much \u2013 it should be a pretty achievable target. So the question is why not just go from 1% to 2%, or is there real risk that your top line is materially weaker than just 2% in the fourth quarter?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. Jason, let me start with the latter question and then I'll step back and address the former. Starting with the latter question, which is regarding the outlook. Again, the outlook for sales growth for the full year is 1% to 2% all-in, including foreign currencies. Now to be clear, fiscal year-to-date we've delivered about 2% sales growth, a little over 2% sales growth all-in. I think as we look to the fourth quarter, we are expecting sales growth to be probably flat to up slightly.","The things that we're monitoring carefully right now, number one, is just foreign currencies. There's a lot of volatility there. Second, our Charcoal business, which by the way is off to a great start certainly in the third quarter, but it's a seasonal business. It's historically had some volatility, so we'll need to see how that plays out. And then finally we're going to continue to invest in our business. So I think on balance it's fair to say, based on what we know, that we're probably in the mid to upper end of that range of the 1% to 2%.","Turning to your question on International, it is challenging because you've got foreign exchange, which is certainly placing a drag on the margins in our International business because, like many companies that have businesses in the emerging markets, you pay for a lot of your costs in dollars. And as a result you take a double hit on that.","We are seeing benefits of lower commodity costs beginning to trickle through to International, but probably to a less extent than we're seeing in the U.S. because the inflationary pressures are higher in the International markets, and where possible we try to source materials locally and try to pay in local currency. So I think the margin challenges in International are a bit more acute.","And I think as Benno said, that's why we're going to focus on what we can control. We're going to lean into pricing. We're going to continue to drive hard against our cost savings. We're going to get smart about how we allocate our investment spend. And then finally, I think there is more opportunity to lower SG&A costs globally but particularly in International, and you'll see us focus on that as well.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks a lot. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, your line is open.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good afternoon. I just wanted to talk a little bit about commodities because you obviously started to see that turn this quarter and just kind of get a better sensing of what you were thinking sort of for 2016 in terms where that can go.","And then also on the logistics costs, I know there are a lot of factors that go in there, but just wondering if you could provide more color as that number moves around. Is that just continuing higher truck and rail costs, or is there something else that we should be thinking about? Thanks.","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So let me start with the logistics question, Olivia. What we have seen \u2013 and this is not unique to Clorox. As we've talked many times before, there's two fundamental problems in logistics that everybody is facing \u2013 simply not enough drivers and trucks. Part of that is changing rules and regulations. Part of it is probably a fallout from the economic slowdown. A lot of trucking companies went out of businesses. There's just not enough trucks on the road, and rail has been somewhat congested. And so that's been driving up overall logistics costs.","I think this area may be impacting Clorox a bit more though than other companies because some of our plants are in more rural locations. We have longer shipping lanes, and we also tend to ship things like bleach and charcoal and cat litter, which weigh a bit more and so you pay a bit more there. So it's an ongoing pressure. It's something that we fully expect will continue through next year, which is why again we're focusing on pricing and cost savings to address it.","In terms of the outlook for commodity costs, again as I said in my opening comments, we anticipate commodity costs to be about flat on the year. But we do expect to get some tailwinds in the fourth quarter. What we're watching very carefully right now is energy prices. Energy prices over the last four weeks to eight weeks have moved up pretty sharply. And one of the things we know over time is that commodity costs tend to come down slowly but they move up pretty quickly","And so resin prices appear to have found a bottom. They're starting to firm up. I do expect that in the fourth quarter there'll be some tailwinds. And there might be some tailwinds going into early fiscal 2016. But we're just keeping a sharp eye on this because these markets have a tendency to swing pretty quickly. But we'll have a better update for you in early August when we provide our outlook for fiscal 2016.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks. And then on bleach pricing, you mentioned that you're gaining share but if private label doesn't end up following in the pricing, what's the game plan there?","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Olivia. So for everybody, as a reminder, we took a 7% price increase in February. Our price increase was executed successfully. And on the competitive side, I would say at this point it's early days and we need to let this play out. Some accounts did follow on the private label side, some not yet. So it's not clear where this will end up. I would offer a few pieces of perspective. First of all, the price increases continue to be cost-justified. Our competitors see the same cost increases that we do. So again, early days, we need to let this play out.","We do have a strong track record obviously taking price increases over the long term. We know how to execute pricing and we're certainly committed to growing our categories profitably. We had anticipated the need to spend some of the pricing benefit back in trade promotion. This is exactly what's happening. This is exactly what is reflected in our outlook. So we are staying the course on pricing on bleach, and also on Glad for that matter, but we'll also stay agile if needed. So if we need to course-correct down the road, we will. But at this point, my expectation is that this price increase will be executed successfully.","We'll probably see, also as a disclaimer, volumes and shares over a few quarters be somewhat depressed. Again, that's a normal thing, and after three quarters to four quarters, once consumers are used to new price points, we should see that ease up and normalize. But overall I would say the price increases are on track.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks a bunch.","Operator","We'll hear next from Joe Altobello from Raymond James.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. First, I guess since we're on bleach, I'll start there in terms of a housekeeping question. You mentioned that Glad volumes were down 9% after the price increase. And I'm not sure you gave the bleach volume number in your prepared remarks.","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Our Laundry business in total, and that includes Clorox 2, it was down, from a volume standpoint, mid-single digits.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. So as expected, I would think.","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","As expected. There was no surprise there for us, as Benno said.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And in terms of Litter and Brita, obviously you guys have struggled in both of these areas of late. And it sounds like they're moving in opposite directions. It seems like Brita's getting a little bit better. And I'm curious, number one, has that business turned a corner, or is still a lot of wood to chop there?","And two, how do you guys fix Litter? And I know this is a very tough question you've been asking for probably three years now. But it's not for lack of spending, and it's not for lack of innovation but that business continues to decline. So I'm just curious if there is something that we haven't heard from you guys yet that you're thinking about to try to turn around that business. Thanks.","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Joe. Thanks. Brita first, Brita has been soft recently, and certainly on the share side we're seeing some improvements. It's, to be honest, too early to say that we've turned a corner but I'm certainly feeling better. The issue on Brita has been private label filter distribution expansion, which led our share and volume to be under pressure and also has led the category to a decline.","We are focused on innovation, innovation on systems but also innovation on filters to differentiate from private label. That work is underway and we're seeing good progress. We're also working with retailers to reverse the trade downs in the category and revitalize the category. And I expect better results in fiscal year 2016. The good news is on Brita that our pour-through systems, which is the majority of the business, is growing and that's typically a precursor to higher filter sales.","So that's the green shoots and I think Brita will see growth in the next fiscal year and I'm quite optimistic. Litter, obviously no surprise, not yet where we want it to be. What we've always said is that it will take a few quarters until we can expect improvements. And I will say that I think that it will take until fiscal year 2016 also. We're focused on earning share and not buying share, which ultimately requires better innovation.","We've put a few things in place that are beginning to take hold. We're investing in better value communication. Lightweight litter, which we've launched earlier this fiscal year, has been quite successful and we're investing behind it. And as Steve Austenfeld said earlier in the call, we have strong innovation coming up in the next fiscal year, which is ultimately what it will take.","So pleased with the progress. I'd also offer as a perspective that Litter is growing both volume and sales fiscal year-to-date. So that share number is certainly the one number that I don't like and no one here at Clorox likes. But to put it in perspective, we're nevertheless growing and we feel good about our prospects for 2016 and beyond.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Benno.","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Joe.","Operator","Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank, please go ahead.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning. Hey, the first question, a couple of housekeeping items. The first is the corporate line in the segment data has been super bouncy, and I think a lot of that is incentive comp. But when you look forward, is the right number like $60 million a quarter? Is that about right?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You're right in your first conclusion, which is incentive \u2013 it includes a lot of things, interest income and expense and other things. But incentive compensation is really what's causing it to move around, and you're going to see variability across the quarters.","The simplest way I'd have you, if you're modeling this out, model this year SG&A cost at about 14% of sales I think is right. And I think again, as we've said many times, over the longer term we'd like to get that number below 14%, but that might be the easiest way to think of this.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, the reason I asked the question is I know you're not going to give us guidance for next year, but there's a really difficult comp on the corporate line in the first quarter. And I think if you look at the Street numbers, if you kind of normalize it to the regular corporate number, the number is like $0.10 too high.","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I haven't seen the consensus for the first quarter, so I really can't comment on that. Again, all I can say is that, for modeling purposes, you're going to see variability across the quarters in SG&A cost, as we previously discussed, and 14% is probably a really good number to use at this point.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then the net-debt-to-EBITDA now is like 1.5 turns, and I think that's fairly below where you guys kind of feel comfortable. So what's the plan on the sort of balance sheet utilization front?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. At the end of the third quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA came in at 1.9, okay? So it's certainly...","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","(43:07)","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I understood. Understood. Yeah. We look at \u2013 you've got to also remember some of that cash is overseas and somewhat trapped. So we like to think of it as about a 1.9 against the target of 2 to 2.5. In any case, our free cash flow fiscal year to date is up 11% versus year ago. So we're certainly feeling very good about our ability to convert sales to cash.","And it gives us a lot of financial flexibility. We've started to use some of that money, as we've discussed for the last few quarters, to invest for growth and we've been putting more money into growth and it's certainly working. We're going to keep the dividend healthy. But you saw us in the third quarter re-enter the market for share repurchases essentially to start offsetting stock option dilution that's occurred over the last couple of quarters.","I think longer term what you'll see us do is we'll continue to obviously support the growth of our business organically with investments. We continue to look for bolt-on acquisitions in the areas that we've discussed and we'll keep the dividend healthy and return cash that we don't need back to the shareholders. So we're certainly sitting in a very good spot with a lot of financial flexibility.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got you. And I know some people complain that I ask too many questions on these calls. But the last one is it seems like finally like the scan to non-scan channels are aligned. Is that going to be the case going forward? So is the sort of Costco stuff lapped and now it seems like, by channel, things are kind of growing at the same rate?","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Should be, yes. So as you rightly say, Bill, the Costco matter, we're through. That happened in Q3 of last year. So we should see, barring any unforeseen events, scan to non-scan to be reasonably aligned, yeah.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks so much, guys.","Operator","We'll hear next from Ali Dibadj from Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Just wanted to go back to the cost justified-ness of the price increases. When I look at your gross margin drivers, at least in this quarter, the 140 basis points you got from price is significantly higher than the combo of commodities and manufacturing logistics. So I'm trying to understand why now was the right time, with the accumulation of all the impacts for the past year or so of commodities impacting you.","And then as you look forward, clearly you have to invest back in the business to try to close some of the price gaps. But I guess I'm trying to understand the logic of why do this in the first place if you're going to try to spend back. Is it just because you want to get a higher lift price and hope the promo kind of eventually goes away, or is there another logic behind this around innovation or something else?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Let me start off and talk about the cost base, and then maybe I can have Benno weigh in with his point of view, the longer-term view of the business.","Starting with cost, keep in mind we're not looking at this for a quarter or two. We actually look at this over a longer period of time. We tend to price to the long-term average cost of where we think these markets are going.","And again, as we've pointed out, logistics costs are up, wage inflation is real, healthcare costs are up, commodities are actually still up in the first half of the fiscal; they went flat in the third quarter. But we have yet to get any relief. So the pricing that we have taken, we think it's the right pricing for the business. It's certainly cost-justified. While it's early days, it's certainly we've executed the price increase as well.","But I'll turn it over to Benno for his thoughts.","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. So to your question, Ali, on investments, I want to make it clear that the benefit we are getting from pricing as far as our profitability is concerned is higher than the amount that we're investing back. So there's still a net benefit. We are committed to growing these categories profitably. As I said earlier, these price increases are cost-justified. And typically what happens, and this time is no exception, that we have to invest back temporarily.","In the long run, I would assume, as has happened in the past, that the trade spend will subside over time and will normalize. But as we are helping consumers adjust to new price points, as we support our brand against competition temporarily, again, as was the case in the past, we will invest back for a net benefit from pricing.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So I have a hard time seeing it as \u2013 perhaps cost-justified is a heavy term, but cost-justified given that you are yourself saying that commodities are going to roll over in the short term. So maybe it's cost-justified certainly to your point on a longer term, but I worry about what's going to happen in the shorter term to you guys, particularly \u2013 and if you can help me with some color on this \u2013 particularly as we've been looking at FSIs every week now for a little while in your categories and other's and it really looks like the European companies are putting significant amount of pressure on this marketplace already based on the currency benefit.","So do you feel that this is a little bit of a dangerous situation to be in relative to the Europe, relative to what the commodities are doing, or do you still feel like you would do it all over again knowing what you know now in the pricing?","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","We would absolutely do it all over again. I will remind you that right now we're growing market share. We've seen the highest market share growth in four years. And the subject categories \u2013 bleach, Glad \u2013 are growing share very nicely. Bleach now we've grown share for the fifth quarter in a row. And in fact what we're also seeing is that the momentum that we have seen over the past years from private label share has become much more modest at this point.","And we're today are growing in fact in dollar terms faster than private label. I would also say that, look, at the end of the day this temporarily higher spend on trade is just one component of what we are doing. I would ask that we also consider that we're investing very strongly in innovation. A lot of our trade spend today goes against fast distribution and innovation. We're seeing several innovations off to a fast start.","On the distribution front, we're pleased with the progress on the cleaning innovation. Glad with Gain is off to a very strong start as is lightweight coal. The new Hidden Valley Ranch flavors with cucumber, avocado and sweet chili are doing nicely. So I would look at it in context of our stated desire to invest in accelerating growth but investing to accelerate growth profitably. And I feel like Q3 is a good example of that. And there is more to come on that front.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. And last question just around advertising spend, roughly just under 9%. Given what you just said, how should we expect that to change going forward?","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't know that we've given a specific guidance on the advertising sales promotion. What we have said is that we want total investment in our brands to increase by 1 point, Ali. And we think that that continues to be a fair assumption. Within the advertising sales promotion line, what you will continue to see is that the U.S. spending is going to continue to float up, which it has. And we are spending less in International today, again consistent with our desire to grow profitably and the stated intention to spend only where profitable in the International market.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","We'll hear next from John Faucher from JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. Thank you. I wanted to talk a little bit on Charcoal. You talked about increased retailer merchandising as a key driver in the third quarter. And I guess what do you think is driving that? Is that weather-related? And I guess what's your visibility in terms of whether that higher level of merchandising is going to be continuing over the course of the summer selling season? Thanks.","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So first what's behind this is we've been on a strategy in Charcoal to encourage year-round merchandising for a while and that's certainly been very successful. We've seen particularly strong success this year. If you think about what's happened in much of the country weather-wise, there was pent-up demand and there was readiness also by retailers to invest in charcoal to get people back into the stores and encourage store traffic, and our merchandising program certainly anticipated that. We've worked with retailers to plan for such events and we've seen particularly strong pull.","The good news is we're seeing quite a bit of that translate into share and category growth. So that obviously makes us feel good about the prospects going forward. We feel good about our start into Q4 on the business. I will say that Charcoal is more difficult to plan. A lot of it does depend on weather and we'll have to see it play out.","But we are certainly very optimistic about how we're executing what we can control and the early success we've had this fiscal year behind merchandising programs, again, all planned and consistent with the strategy that we've had on the business for a while.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. If I can ask a follow-up on that; that makes sense, I guess. But if you're getting incremental sort of counter-seasonal promotional activity, it seems like as you cycle into the normal promotional activity that the incremental benefit year-over-year should lessen almost by definition, right, because you're going up against a seasonal period when you're used to having more merchandising. Is that right?","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","We've seen particularly strong growth on the business in Q3. Do I expect those types of growth rates to continue? I don't think so. But again, on Charcoal one can be surprised at times. It depends on a lot of factors, including weather. But again, I'm looking at what do our plans look like and what do they look like compared to year ago and I certainly feel very good about those and we need to let Q4 play out.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then if I can just follow up on Ali's last question about advertising. The ad-to-sales ratio had come down over the past couple of years. There was a lot of discussion about International being the key driver of that falloff in the whole company ad-to-sales ratio going down. Is that something where you just talked about the profitable growth, I guess it seems like it was masking something that you had to go back and now you're saying you have to spend more. How can we get comfortable, I guess, that it really is the International piece that's driving that down when your stated need to increase advertising in the U.S. would indicate that the U.S. was also part of a driver of that reduction over the past couple of years, if that makes sense.","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So John, let me take this. If you go back and you look at this over the last couple of years, our U.S. retail spending has been anywhere between 9% and 10%. In fact, I think it's been closer to 10% than 9%. So what you've seen us do is shift more spending into the U.S. retail business.","Keep in mind the Professional Products business, which has been growing fabulously for us, we really don't have any advertising expense in there. So you have to be careful with that number. International, I think as we've talked for quite some time, we have been making cuts in advertising. Back when we were in Venezuela, we had basically turned off the advertising. We're spending very little, if any, advertising in Argentina in some of these markets that have price controls.","So we've systematically gone into those markets that are margin-challenged and have some issues and we're really pulling back on the advertising. By contrast, we've been putting it in the U.S., which is why we've been quoting I think for the last few quarters what we're spending in our U.S. retail business. So we feel good about the total demand-building investment. We feel good how it's building market share for us. Certainly it's driving top-line momentum in the U.S. business and I think you can see that in the numbers.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll move next to Chris Ferrara from Wells Fargo.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. I guess going back to the share gains in the U.S., I think if I'm right, if I caught it right, the number was 30 basis points of gain, right? And that's despite a couple of price gap issues, right? So I guess the question is how sustainable do you view that level of share? And I guess where would you put the level of share gain needed to meet your growth objectives over time in the U.S.?","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So we feel good about the share gains. We feel also good about the fact that they're really broad. Other than Brita and Litter, we're growing share everywhere. It's our objective to grow share in the U.S. but it's also our objective to grow categories. One thing that I would note is that behind the increase in investment and also behind the innovation, our categories this quarter have been quite healthy. We saw 2% category growth this quarter. That's been as high as it's been in recent years.","I would say in the future I would expect our share gains to continue. I would think that on Glad and bleach we might see somewhat depressed shares for three quarters to four quarters as we cycle through those price increases. But we are putting the plans in place based on stronger investments, based on strong innovation, based on competitive marketing communication that's centered around consumer value, that should make us expect to continue to see share gains.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And I guess on the buyback, on a separate note, are you done with the targeted buybacks you guys were \u2013 I think you said you were going after some of the share creep you'd had. Are you guys done with that?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think what we've consistently said is, within our outlook, we will periodically re-enter the market to soak up stock option dilution. And I think you'll see us again periodically do that with the excess cash. Beyond that, we haven't commented on specific plans.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Lauren Lieberman from Barclays, your line is open.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Just quickly on bleach, I was curious did you talk about what you have seen more recently as demand is kind of normalizing or accelerating now that pricing has been in the market for a couple of months? Thanks.","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So I mean on bleach what we're seeing is that share has been strong. I mentioned earlier we've seen five quarters of share growth on the business. Expect that to ease up, so feeling good from that vantage point. I think as far as the category is concerned, our expectations are that that will be more flat going forward. But feel good about the innovation program that we're putting in, feel good about the communication that we're putting in. One thing that we're doing is supplementing the very strong focus on Laundry with stronger communication around cleaning occasions. One thing that we found is that heavy users in particular display a lot more usage around cleaning occasions on top of laundry, so we will focus on that part of the business.","So I would say bleach is steady as she goes and feel good about the prospects in the category with the one caveat that we'll cycle through the price increase and somewhat slower consumption over the next three quarters to four quarters.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks. And then also just on Green Works, I was surprised to see Green Works Laundry called out in the release. So my recollection was that you were kind of giving Green Works, the line, another go, but I thought it was more in the Household Cleaners and not so much in Laundry. So maybe I need an update on what's been going on or not going on with the Green Works franchise.","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. You're correct, Lauren. Our focus in Green Works actually is on the Cleaners side and we have three core categories: sprays, toilet bowl cleaners and wipes. And those are performing okay. Green Works laundry was a distribution loss with one specific customer. It's non-strategic. It's a one-time event but it doesn't affect our plans on the remaining Green Works business going forward.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll hear next from Erin Lash from Morningstar.","Erin Lash - Morningstar Research","Thank you for taking my question. I was hoping you could talk about the acquisition environment. I think there was a lot of talk at CAGNY in terms of the fact that acquisition premiums being demanded by sellers were too high. And I just wondered if that had changed, or if there's any I guess your interest in looking to acquire to, as a use of cash.","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Well, a couple of things. First of all, we certainly have plenty of dry powder to be able to do bolt-on acquisitions, as I mentioned earlier. So no concerns there. From an acquisition market, it continues to be, particularly in the U.S., a seller's market more than a buyer's market. And I think you see that when you look at the multiples some of these businesses are trading at.","All of that said, we do have a pipeline of ideas we're working against. We continue to be very interested in natural personal care and opportunities in that space. The whole idea of health and wellness is interesting. We like U.S.-centric businesses because it allows us to hopefully pay for a deal on synergies with our U.S. business and then buy a growth upside.","So I would say we stand ready to do acquisitions. We're continuing to work the pipeline. But I think these things take time and they're pretty difficult to predict. Nonetheless, we think we'll be successful over the next couple of years.","Erin Lash - Morningstar Research","Thank you for that. And just one follow-up. You mentioned that it is a seller's market. In that light, and obviously several of your peers have been looking to kind of skew their brand portfolio, was that something that you've considered or are you happy with the brand mix as it stands?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You might recall that over the last couple of years I think we have made some adjustments in the portfolio. We exited the auto business because we didn't like the trends of things like STP. We didn't think it was right for us as a company. Of course we more recently exited Venezuela as a way of adjusting the portfolio.","I think like other companies we do have small brands that are probably trapped in the portfolio. We're always looking at that to find out if we're the highest-value owner. Keep in mind, though, many of those businesses have been in the portfolio for decades. As a result, they have virtually no tax base. So sometimes it's better to manage the business for cash over the long term and use that cash to invest for growth or return it back through the dividend back to our shareholders then to sell those businesses where you may have substantial tax leakage.

Steve will follow with a review of our financial performance for the quarter and fiscal year, as well as discuss our current outlook for fiscal year '13. And finally, before turning to Q&A, Don will close, commenting on some areas of strategic focus for the fiscal year.","With that, let me turn it over to Larry.","Lawrence S. Peiros","Thanks, Steve, and hello to everybody on the call. Overall, our fourth quarter top line performance was strong, and we finished fiscal '12 in good fashion. We delivered sales growth of 4% on top of 4% sales growth in the year-ago quarter. Even without the recent acquisitions, sales grew about 2.5%, and sales were up in all 4 of our business segments.","Turning to volumes. Q4 volume was up 2%, about half the rate of sales growth, due to the benefit of price increases across most of the portfolio. Our new product innovation program delivered record levels in fiscal '12, with over 3 points of incremental sales growth. And our integrated marketing plans continued to drive strong market share results. We feel great about the quarter and the progress we are making in driving top line growth in a tough economic climate.","In our U.S. business, our all-outlet retail market share reached a record high. We were up about 0.5 share points over the past 52 weeks to a 28.1% share. Moreover, we gained or held share in every one of our U.S. categories. These share results are particularly encouraging given recent price increases on almost every U.S. brand.","The other good news is that our U.S. categories are getting healthier as pricing takes hold and the economy recovers. Overall category consumption on an all-outlet basis was up about 0.5 points for the past 52 weeks. This is the first consumption growth we have seen in our U.S. categories in the past 3 years.","Our Cleaning segment delivered a very strong quarter, with volume up 5% and sales up 7% behind volume gains and pricing. Home Care volume increased behind double-digit increases in our portfolio of Clorox-branded cleaning products, including strong gains in Clorox Disinfecting Wipes due to strong merchandising and solid innovation like our new bleach -- our new Clorox Bleach Foaming Spray.","Gains in Home Care were partially offset by volume declines in Pine-Sol due to a substantial price increase driven by escalating pine oil costs. Our overall Home Care market share was up almost 1 full point, achieving a record all-out market share in the past 52 weeks.","Our Laundry business saw volume declines, primarily due to the impact of price increases taken last August of the Clorox Bleach and Clorox 2 products. Dollar share was flat for the past 52 weeks, and the category is stabilizing after a couple years of significant decline. This month, we will begin the rollout of our new concentrated Clorox Bleach. Retailer reaction has been very positive, and we expect a smooth transition and strong merchandising support.","On our Professional Products business, we saw another strong quarter. Volume was up by over 50%, driven by the recent acquisitions and a double-digit increase on the base business.","In our Household segment, volume declined 2%, and sales grew 3%. Glad saw volume and sales declines, driven primarily by losses on Glad food storage products behind recent price increases and some distribution losses. Glad regular trash bags were also down in the quarter, but premium trash bags were up mid-single digits behind continued growth on Glad OdorShield with Febreze.","On Charcoal, volume was equal to the year-ago quarter, and sales were up high single digits, driven by pricing and favorable mix.","Cat Litter volumes and sales were down in Q4 due to a recent price increase and lower merchandising. On an all-outlet basis, Cat Litter continued to grow share over the past 52 weeks behind share gains on Fresh Step.","In our Lifestyle segment, volume grew 2%, and sales grew 3%. Volume and sales were up strongly in our U.S. Burt's Bees business behind category growth and innovation including g\u00fcd, our Natural Personal care brand. Brita grew sales and volumes at high single-digit rates behind the continuous success of the Brita Bottle. We\u2019ve already launched a variety of new bottles in different colors and have recently launched a line of the smaller bottles designed for kids.","Sales in Dressings and Sauces were about flat, with the benefit of pricing offsetting the negative volume impact of price increases.","In our International segment, both volume and sales were up 3%. In Latin America, our largest international region, volume was up, and sales grew mid-single digits. Solid performance despite some losses in our nonstrategic export business and double-digit volume declines in Venezuela resulting from the government's recently implemented price control law.","We also grew volume and sales in the rest of the world. Our market share was up in Latin America but down in Canada and Australia. Category sales growth remains quite strong in Latin America, with slower growth in the more developed International markets.","Let me take a minute to provide perspective in our advertising spending in the quarter. Our advertising rate was about 8% of sales, down about 1 point from our normal spending rate. Trade spending was up about 1 point, resulting in total brand building spending equal to the year ago quarter. About half of the advertising reduction was in International, reflecting the continuing challenging additions in both Venezuela and Argentina, given the combination of high inflation and government-imposed price controls.","For the full fiscal '12, our U.S. advertising was above the 9% rate, and we continue to see improvement in our advertising ROI, reflecting the fact that both our sales growth and share results continue to be strong. We also retained a high share of voice in each of our categories, often by a wide margin.","In fiscal '13, we are targeting a 9% rate of spending for the total company, consistent with where we have been over the last several years. We will ebb and flow a bit versus that target on a quarterly basis.","Overall, we feel good about our Q4 top line results, as well as the 5% sales growth we delivered in fiscal '12. Our record U.S. share results reinforce that we are doing the right things to build our brands in a tough environment.","Looking forward, our sales outlook for fiscal '13 remains 2% to 4%, reflecting continued momentum, supported by innovation across our brands, but moderated by uncertainty in some international markets and a tougher comparison to a strong fiscal '12. We are looking forward to another year of solid top line performance.","With that, I'll turn it over to Steve.","Stephen M. Robb","Thanks, Larry, and hello, everyone. I'm going to review our fourth quarter and fiscal year results and discuss our outlook for fiscal '13. Starting with the fourth quarter. Sales grew 4%. We had gains in all 4 reportable segments. Excluding the impact of the Aplicare and HealthLink acquisitions, sales were up more than 2%, driven by the benefits of pricing and base volume growth. These benefits were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates and higher trade spending, both of which impacted sales by nearly 1 point.","As expected, our fourth quarter gross margin decreased 80 basis points to 42.7% versus 43.5% in the year ago quarter. While pricing and cost savings more than offset higher commodity costs, increased costs for compensation, manufacturing and logistics had a material impact on margin. Mix also had a negative impact on margin of about 80 basis points, but less than we saw in the third quarter, when we had particularly strong merchandising events.","Turning to selling and administrative expense. The rate of spending came in pretty much as we expected at about 14% of sales. The year-over-year increase reflected higher compensation expenses and our investments in IT systems and new R&D facilities.","Net of all these factors, we delivered earnings from continuing operations of $174 million or $1.32 of diluted earnings per share. This compares with $169 million or $1.26 in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 5% diluted EPS.","Next, I'll turn to our results for the full fiscal year. Sales were up a strong 5% for the fiscal year, with gains in all 4 segments. This reflects improving U.S. categories, strong results on our base business, a very successful pricing execution and the benefits of the recent acquisitions. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, sales grew a healthy 4%.","Fiscal '12 gross margin decreased 140 basis points to 42.1% compared with 43.5% in fiscal '11. As we discussed before, the biggest factors were higher commodity costs and inflation in manufacturing and logistics, partially offset by pricing, as well as another year of very strong cost savings exceeding $100 million.","Turning to selling and administrative expense. The rate of spending came in at about 15% of sales, as expected. This is about 1 point higher than we've historically seen, primarily due to our investments in IT systems and new R&D facilities. Our tax rate for the fiscal year was about 31%. This is lower than our typical range of 34% to 35%, due primarily to lower tax on foreign earnings. For fiscal '13, we continue to expect an effective tax rate of approximately 34%.","Net of all of these factors, we delivered earnings from continuing operations of $543 million or $4.10 diluted earnings per share. This is a 4% increase in diluted EPS versus last year, excluding the fiscal '11 noncash goodwill impairment charge on Burt's Bees. Free cash flow from continuing operations in fiscal '12 was $428 million or about 8% of sales versus $462 million or about 9% in fiscal '11. The decrease was driven mainly by lower tax payments in fiscal '11, resulting from favorable tax depreciation rules and the timing of tax payments in fiscal '12. We continue to expect free cash flow to improve in fiscal '13 and beyond as we rebuild our margins and complete our infrastructure investments. As a reminder, we define free cash flow as cash provided by operations less capital expenditures.","We ended the year with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5:1, at the upper end of our targeted range of 2 to 2.5. We anticipate further reducing our leverage in fiscal '13 to about the midpoint of our targeted range.","Next, I'll turn to our outlook for fiscal '13, which does reflect some updated assumptions. We continue to anticipate sales growth in the range of 2% to 4% behind moderate category improvement and strong innovation. Since our last update in May, foreign currencies are slightly more negative, and planned pricing is being reduced in light of the current softening commodity environment. We anticipate the majority of our fiscal '13 pricing being International to help offset foreign exchange and higher inflationary costs. Net of these factors, we are still comfortable with our outlook for sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%.","We now expect EBIT margin to be up 25 to 50 basis points for the full fiscal year, reflecting recent softness in commodity prices, partially offset by more moderate pricing assumptions and decreasing foreign currencies. Our assumptions for higher global manufacturing and logistics costs, strong cost savings and reduced impact from mix remain unchanged.","International was the one area that we continue to closely monitor both from a sales and margin standpoint. Although we are executing well in most markets, 2 of our larger businesses are in Latin America: Argentina and Venezuela. Both of which have some form of price controls in place and challenging economic environments.","Turning to selling and administrative expense. We continue to anticipate expenses for systems and facilities investments, as well as other infrastructure-related investments to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million or about equal to fiscal '12. Both the SAP implementation in Latin America and the move to a new innovation center in Pleasanton are on track and expected to be completed by the end of fiscal '13.","Finally, as noted in today's press release, we are continuing with plans to optimize our real estate portfolio, including selling our former R&D facility in Pleasanton, California. Although we continue to anticipate a net gain on real estate transactions, it is no longer expected in fiscal '13, and we are still refining the timing and other assumptions. For this reason, our updated outlook no longer includes a one-time gain of $0.05 to $0.07 diluted earnings per share. Net of all these factors, we continue to anticipate fiscal '13 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of $4.20 to $4.35 per share.","And looking closer in, we expect sales in the first half of fiscal '13 to be generally in the range of our full year outlook of 2% to 4%. We anticipate gross margin to begin improving in the first half. But EBIT margin will decline in the first half for 2 reasons: first, we're still completing our remaining IT and facilities investments; second, we continue to expect inflationary pressures, and worsening currencies have also become a concern. EBIT margin is expected to grow in the back half of the fiscal year, supporting the full year increase of 25 to 50 basis points.","We also continue to anticipate free cash flow of about 9% of sales in fiscal '13. Our priorities for the use of cash remain unchanged. These include investing in organic and inorganic growth, supporting the dividend, maintaining our targeted debt leverage ratio and returning any remaining excess cash to shareholders.","For fiscal '13, we project capital spending in the range of $230 million to $240 million, which includes the investments in systems and facilities. We continue to expect capital spending to decline after fiscal '13 to roughly $200 million to $210 million per year.","In closing, I'm very pleased with our results in the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. And looking ahead, we are confident about our plans for fiscal '13 and beyond.","With that, I'll turn it over to Don to recap, and we will open it up for questions.","Donald R. Knauss","Okay. Thanks, Steve, and hello, everyone. I, too, certainly feel great about the strong finish to the fiscal year. As we've talked -- as Larry and Steve have talked, we grew sales 4% on the top of the 4% sales growth that we had in the prior year quarter and also grow earnings per share of 5%, and that was on top of 20% growth in earnings per share last year in the same quarter. So I think those results are a good testimony to the strength of our brands and our innovation and, really, our people's excellent execution of the strategy we talked to you about in late May. And I think it's pretty impressive when we consider the challenges I know you're all aware of that every company is facing in this tough economy.","So looking forward, we're going to continue to execute against the strategic initiatives we outlined at the Analyst Meeting in late May. First, we're focused on those 3 growth colors. Recall U.S. retail, which represents about 75% of our portfolio, Professional Products, and then the International side of our business. In our U.S. retail business, it's all about this continuing excellent execution of our 3D demand driving programs with breakthrough advertising, collaborating with our retail customers to win at the shelf and, then of course, continuing to accelerate innovation to build our brands and categories. And as Larry noted, we've got a strong pipeline for fiscal '13 in innovation, as well as we had in fiscal '12.","In Professional Products, our plan is to leverage our brands and technologies to grow our Healthcare business organically and expand inorganically through bolt-on acquisitions like we did with Aplicare and HealthLink.","And finally, in International, we're focused on growing in the current markets where we have significant scale and capability, as we outlined at the analyst meeting. We will complete our SAP implementation in Latin America this year and certainly look forward to the business building and the cost savings benefits that it will provide over the longer term.","Now as we also mentioned at the meeting, rebuilding our margins is a clear priority, and this will be done certainly by continuing our strong track record of cost savings, taking pricing where appropriate and where cost-justified and when necessary, obviously offsetting the commodity and other inflationary pressures we see, and working to improve mix with a focus on higher margin categories, margin-accretive innovation and, of course, more efficient trade spending.","I think the new innovation center in Pleasanton will certainly be occupied by the end of this year. And it's going to be a real boost to both our innovation and cost saving efforts. Finally, as Steve discussed, we expect to continue to generate a high level of cash and utilize it as we have in the past in a shareholder-friendly manner.","All said, as we enter our Centennial year, I continue to feel very optimistic about our plans to drive profitable growth.","And with that, let's open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]  And our first question will come from Alice Longley of Buckingham Research.","Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I'm just trying to look at what the performance of the U.S. alone in the quarter, I'm backing out that maybe volume here was down 2%, and price mix was a positive 3%? Is that right? Or could you correct that?","Lawrence S. Peiros","No. To be honest, I don't have those numbers off the top of my head because we don't look at the U.S. business independently. Sounds about right, but I think we\u2019d have to get back to you on the specific.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Linda Bolton-Weiser with Caris.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just on the mix issue. I mean, you did mention very specifically that the 80-basis-point gross margin impact was better than last quarter. But I don't recall actually getting a specific quantification last quarter. Could you just give us that? And also, the mix impact on sales, I guess, this quarter was negative 2%. And what was that in the March quarter as well? And then related to that, mix -- still the 80-basis-point impact, even though it's improved, it's still pretty negative. And how should we just think about this over the very long term? Is this a real secular issue that's just going to be a drag on your gross margin kind of on a real long-term basis? Or maybe could you just talk about the whole issue a little bit more?","Stephen M. Robb","Yes, this is Steve Robb. I can provide some color on this. So I believe we did provide the mix impact in the third quarter. But as a reminder, it was a 140-basis-point drag on our third quarter gross margins, and just as a reminder, part of the reason that was larger than we've historically seen as we had -- because we had some unusually strong merchandising events that went on during the quarter, which increased it. As we have previously communicated, we\u2019d expected mix to continue to be a drag, but not the same extent that we have seen in the third quarter. So for the fourth quarter of this fiscal year, fiscal '12, what we saw was that mix was an impact of about 80 basis points. Now looking forward, a couple of things. First, we do continue to anticipate that mix will be unfavorable, but we don't expect that it will be unfavorable at the same level that we've seen in fiscal '12, in part, because some of the negative mix is already in the base and in part because we're starting to anniversary some of the particularly strong merchandising events that we saw in fiscal '12. But this long-term trend where consumers are trading up to larger, more value-oriented sizes is going to continue, which is why as we shared in May, we're going to continue to focus on taking a sharp eye to price curves to make sure that we take pricing where appropriate, continue to drive hard against our cost savings and then, finally, focus on margin-accretive innovation. And we think those things, over time, will help us mitigate some of the negative impact on mix.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Great. And can I just ask one other one on the gross margin? You quantified the other piece of the mix, other impact, and the increase in incentive comp was a pretty big impact. I think it was something like 100 basis points. Why is there so much of that in gross margin? Usually, I would expect to see that in SG&A.","Stephen M. Robb","Yes. So keep in mind that the incentive-based compensation is actually split between SG&A but also gross margin. It gets into the accounting and where the people reside and how it gets classified in the P&L, so that's not unusual. But let me step back and provide a perspective on incentive compensation. So just stepping back, our short-term incentive compensation program really has 2 metrics: first is sales growth, and the second is economic profit growth. Now in fiscal '11, the base year, that was the year when we established goals for ourselves, and we simply did not achieve all of our goals. And as a result, we are a pay-for-performance company. So we simply did not pay out at 100% against those objectives. Fiscal '12, by contrast, has been a much stronger year. And we have met, and in many instances exceeded, the goals we have set for ourselves. So really, what you're looking at is a low-based period in fiscal '11, a higher number in fiscal '12. I think you should start to go to fiscal '13, we would expect it\u2019ll have more of a normalized look.","Donald R. Knauss","I think the other thing you should note is that our product supply organization, where we have over 50% of our employees, everyone in the manufacturing side of our business now is eligible for an annual incentive. And we shifted funds around from other buckets, for example, pension, to give people more of a potential earn cash in the current year. So you're seeing what Steve said, which was a depressed year ago, obviously better performance in FY '12 against targets, but you're also seeing now a much larger swathe of people in manufacturing eligible for a cash incentive, which we think drives cost savings long-term.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just wanted to get underneath your decision around advertising versus trade spend a little bit. So what categories specifically was the shift happening? You certainly mentioned advertising in Latin America, but was that aligned with trade spend or are there other things at play? So for example, competition, was that trying to take advantage of some of the anticipated commodity release? And moreover, the trade spend, if it was in the U.S. or North America business, it didn't really drive a lot of volume, I guess. So trying to understand the almost trade spend elasticity in some sense as well.","Lawrence S. Peiros","So 2 big buckets, I think we talked about the International bucket, which is about half of the reduction year-over-year, and that's just because of a -- we have a very difficult situation with price controls, bad economies, just doesn't make sense to spend a lot of money in those kind of environments. And in fact, in some cases, we're supply-constrained in those environments. So that's a fairly, I think, clear decision for all the right reasons. On the trade spending side in the U.S., I would say there's one business that did have a material impact in terms of the shift between advertising and trade, and that was the Glad business. And so we are starting to see as resin has come down fairly significantly, competitors are starting to spend back, starting with the private label, and it\u2019s migrating to some of the branded competitors. And so we are starting to spend back on Glad a little bit to essentially kind of maintain reasonable price gaps versus competition. So I would say that's the one category, and that was a fairly material part of the number. So those 2 buckets, I think, explain probably about 3\/4 of the change.","Donald R. Knauss","And the one thing I would add -- Ali, this is Don. -- is that when you look at the U.S. advertising spending for the year, it's right in the middle of our 9% to 10% range, so I wouldn't get too fixated on 1 quarter given that, obviously, these things will move around quarter-to-quarter. But we are committed to hanging into that range as we go into fiscal '13. I think the other thing is our -- as I think Larry mentioned, our ROI on marketing spend is up significantly. We're getting better and getting more impactful advertising. Our advanced analytic models are working very well. And I think the proof\u2019s in the pudding in the sense that we're gaining share. And our shares being at an all-time high, we think we're reinvesting at the appropriate level and with the right mechanisms.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful in terms of how you think about it. So if you take that and roll it forward, in the 2% to 4% top line for next fiscal year, how does that break out in terms of volume and price as best you can tell right now? And it sounds like that's different in the different halves of the year, quarters of the year, so if you can give us some clarity there, that will be helpful.","Donald R. Knauss","Let me give you -- let me start, Ali, and I'll let Steve and Larry jump in. If you think about how we built that algorithm, basically, we've got about 3 points of growth from new items, new innovation from our pipeline. We've got about 1 point of acquisitions, and we've got about 1 point of pricing, most of that being in international markets and high-inflation markets. So you've got about 5 points of growth there. But we've got about 2 points of foreign exchange headwind, so you strip it out, and we're right in the middle of our 2% to 4% range.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then I don\u2019t know if Steve wants to add, but cadence around the quarters or halves.","Donald R. Knauss","I think it's fairly aligned with -- as Steve said, the first half we look at is fairly consistent with the 2% to 4% outlook for the full year. We don't see a lot of volatility quarter-to-quarter on the top line.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then my last one is around free cash flow. You mentioned -- Steve mentioned, I guess, it's going to continue to improve going forward. Can you give us a sense of that? I mean, is that in line with EPS growth in some sense? Are there things you're doing to improve working capital base so it gives it a little bit of a boost? And then all of that spend, how do you think about, as you mentioned, returning it to shareholders, so dividend, obviously, share buybacks. But also, how much should we think about it driving that 1 point of acquisition that you're expecting to drive the top line?","Stephen M. Robb","So let me just step back and first comment on free cash flow, then we can talk about the uses of cash. So the free cash flow, the outlook for fiscal '13 is, as I mentioned a few minutes ago in my opening comments, we anticipate it should be about 9% of sales. Now that is a little bit lower than we\u2019ve historically seen, where free cash flow has historically been around 10% or north of 10%. The reason it's just a little bit lower than the historical average is because of these infrastructure investments that we\u2019ve talked about and the fact that margins have come down, and we're still in the process now of rebuilding margins. I think as we look to fiscal '14 and beyond, Ali, we fully expect that free cash flow as a percentage of sales should be about 10%, maybe better than that, as we anniversary the infrastructure investments and as we continue to take the actions that we've talked about to improve our margins. Now in terms of how we deploy that cash, we're really not changing the algorithm that we have for the company. We'll continue to support organic growth and inorganic bolt-on acquisitions. We'll continue to support the dividend, which I think as we've talked before has increased for a number of years, and it generally increases at the rate of growth in operating profit over time. And we'll continue to pay down our debt. Our debt-to-EBITDA, as I've mentioned, is about 2.5 right now to 1, and we'd like to see that get closer to the middle of our range. Now as we go through the year, if after having done those 3 things, we have excess cash that's starting to pool up on our balance sheet, I think consistent with what we've done in the past, we will work in partnership with our board, and we will look for efficient ways to get that back to our shareholders. And that could include buying back some additional shares, either to offset stock option dilution or just to do some discretionary share repurchases. But I think at this point, we need to get further in the year before we make any more assumptions around that.","Steve Austenfeld","Ali, just one other point of clarification. When Don talked about 1 point of benefit next year at the top line from acquisitions, that isn't presuming at this point any new acquisitions, just the carryover the benefit from the acquisitions we made mid-last year, like Aplicare and HealthLink. So there's no presumed funding required for those. Those businesses have already been purchased.","Lawrence S. Peiros","This is Larry. I want to come back to Alice's, the first question around performance in the U.S. That will help some of my colleagues here. So from a U.S. perspective, volume was up just above 1%, and sales were up 4%. They're reflecting the difference in pricing essentially.","Operator","We'll go next to John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Two questions here. So the first one\u2019s a little bit of a pushback, following Ali's question which related to the advertising, which is you would expect the shift from advertising to trade promotion would improve market shares in the short term. So I guess, can you talk a little bit about how closely you can monitor share of voice and things like that, so we can feel comfortable that you're really not sort of using the seed corn here? And then secondly, could you just sort of clarify your first half guidance? Because I think margin expectations may be a little bit high potentially for the first quarter, so if you could just sort of give us a little more color there.","Donald R. Knauss","John, let me start on the advertising, and then I'll turn it over to Larry. I think you can take some real comfort as our investors should from the fact that if you look back over the last 4 full years, we've gained 1.9 share points, private label has gained 1.2, and our branded competitors have lost over 3 share points combined. So I think we've done a really good job of -- over the long term, of gaining the share. It wasn't like an episodic from 1 quarter to the next. I feel confident about the advanced analytic models we use. We obviously monitor this month to month in terms of our share of voice. We're looking at it constantly. We're also looking at, obviously, the price gaps, and given the economic environment, and we obviously look at this by category. But when you get into the trash bag category, for example, it's obviously highly sensitive to price gaps. So I think you should take comfort in the fact that these share gains, which reached an all-time high for the last 52 weeks, have been on a real roll for the last 4 years.","Lawrence S. Peiros","I think would just build on that to say is there is absolutely no indication that either our sales or shares results have been hurt by what is a fairly modest amount of spending reduction.","Donald R. Knauss","The other thing I would add, John, is if you look at the full fiscal year '12 for the U.S. business, it was right smack in the middle of our 9% to 10% range. So the International thing really added some -- a little bit of complexity the last quarter. But given the volatility in Argentina, Venezuela, the price control situation, which was ambiguous, we didn't think it was a prudent spend of our investors' money to go in there and spend advertising when the consumer is sitting on the sidelines.","Stephen M. Robb","John, this is Steve. Let me take the second half of your question, which really talks to margins, and see if I can clarify. So for the full year, there's a couple of things that we believe at this point, based on the recent softness we're seeing in commodities. First and foremost is that gross margins are going to begin to stabilize and improve. And in fact, we are looking for modest gross margin expansion over the year. And we fully expect that gross margins will begin to show some consecutive improvement even as we go into the first half of fiscal '13. Now EBIT margin is expected to expand about 25 to 50 basis points for the full year, kind of consistent with our long-term aspirations. But we do expect it to be down somewhat in the first half. And the reason for that is because the infrastructure investments, this $50 million to $55 million that we've talked about, a disproportionate amount of that is going to fall to the first half because we're completing our implementation of SAP in Latin America in the first half of this calendar year, and we've got significant investments as we rebuild our R&D facilities in the first half. So you should be looking for gross margins showing some improvement. But that is going to be offset by higher SG&A and other expenses, which is why we think EBIT margin will be down. And importantly, as we get to the second half of the fiscal year, we would anticipate that EBIT margins will be coming up and that, for the full year, will be up this 25 to 50 basis points.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, so and not to belabor this point, there's a lot of volatility sort of in the operating margin comps, sort of Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, and probably pay less attention to that and a little bit more to the cadence in the spending that you talked about. Is that fair?","Stephen M. Robb","I think that's right.","Operator","And we go next to Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just want to try and be crystal clear, so there's isn't any confusion. If you're looking for that much margin contraction in the first half and the 2% to 4% on the top line, are we -- should we be modeling earnings down in both the first and the second quarter bottom line EPS?","Stephen M. Robb","I would say that with a negative EBIT margin in the first half, yes, that, certainly, the operating results are going to be challenged in the first half.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. My second question is with regard to the higher level of promotional spending on the Glad business, is there a point at which the resin prices have come down so much that you'd expect to see negative pricing there or a change in the count per box or anything like that?","Lawrence S. Peiros","So if you look at Glad over time, we\u2019ve taken pricing up [indiscernible]. We've also taken some price declines. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re at this point close to where you would consider to take a price rollback. So it's more likely to come in the form of trade spending increases versus actual rollback in terms of charcoal price. But over the long term, you might expect ups and downs in the category like Glad.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. And then the second question I had just on the advertising and promo. You've given us guidance on -- I think on the advertising line for next year. But since promo has ticked up, would you assume that the aggregate level or the absolute level of promo spending stays flat? Or will there be an offset, and that will come down as advertising goes up? So net-net, total marketing reinvestment, does that go up next year? Or is it just the flip back into advertising, if you will?","Lawrence S. Peiros","So I think trade spending will probably be about flat versus this year, and advertising will be up just a bit. [indiscernible].","Donald R. Knauss","It's kind of a modest increase, Wendy, in total demand spending.","Operator","We'll go next to Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","I would like to understand your forecast for commodities. You are talking about that they are deflating. Could you give us a sense whether if there even is an area where you're going to have a benefit, that commodities could be a benefit in the gross margin? Number two, if commodities are deflating, you took significant amount of pricing in the fourth quarter, at least the Pine-Sol, 17% and all that, and that led to about 230 basis points of favorable impact  in the gross margin line. Shouldn't you have a very significant gross margin expansion in the first 2 quarters, taking into account the cadence of commodities and all these extra pricing that you took in May, between May and July?","Stephen M. Robb","Okay, Javier, this is Steve. Let me take that in part. So let's start with the outlook for commodities. I think the good news is -- and we started talking this in May. Two things needed to be true for the rate of increase for commodities to slow. We need to see energy prices come down and stay down. We've actually seen that over the last few months, which is very good news. In addition to that, and this is probably more important, in some commodity groups, particularly resin, we've seen a softening in demand, and inventories are up a bit. So the combination of lower energy prices and softening demand, in particular, into resin is actually causing the price to be down. And in fact, on a year-over-year basis, at this point, we do anticipate the resin costs are expected to be modestly lower. That said, when we look at the balance of the commodities, we're not seeing deflation. What we're seeing is the commodities are likely flat to up slightly. So we need to step back and look at our outlook for commodities in total. Again, we would say that it's not a deflationary scenario. Commodity costs will probably still go up modestly, but certainly at a much slower rate than we saw in fiscal '12. I would also just point out that other inflationary pressures on wages, benefits and other supply-chain costs continue to go up. So in total, we're still anticipating some headwinds. As it relates to pricing, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, I think we do believe that the benefit of cost savings and pricing will help gross margins in the first half of the fiscal because we expect that, that will overcome the commodity costs, which are expected to be -- and other inflationary pressures, which are a lot less than what we saw in the year-ago period.","Steve Austenfeld","Javier, I'll just add one thing. Larry mentioned that none of the brands which have taken pricing on right now -- it doesn't suggest we need to reverse those prices at this point. You'd pointed Pine-Sol. You're right, we're taking a pretty significant increase, or we did back in April. But one of the commodities that's causing our commodity pictures still to look unfavorable for next year, maybe flat to unfavorable, is pine oil, which is the primary ingredient in Pine-Sol. And that's still up dramatically. So again, these increases have been cost- or price-justified, either commodity-related or inflationary-related, and even on that Pine-Sol increases, it\u2019s not something where we think we're going to reverse it at this point.","Donald R. Knauss","And I think the other thing, Javier, that we want to be mindful of as we go into the year is, and when you look at what's happening with corn pricing, and obviously, we use cornstarch in Kingsford; and you look at soybean oil, which we use in Hidden Valley Ranch salad dressing, those commodities are up significantly. So we want to be mindful. We have some -- we've got some -- certainly, some good news on resin, but as Steve and Steve have said, we got some pressure on these other ones so...","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Understood. And I have another question because you have been alluded before in the call, and it has to do with these advertising spending and whether there was good quarter is a bad quality quarter or not. Could you talk about the IT spending, how much this IT spending was in the quarter? So to help understand -- people understand to what extent is what\u2019s a high-quality quarter or it's not a high-quality quarter.","Donald R. Knauss","Let me just say this before I turn it to Steve. In terms of a high-quality quarter, I think when your demand spending is basically flat, because again, we look at total demand spending, not just advertising or trade promotions. So we look at the whole bucket. We look at it as flat. And the fact that we have gained share, I think, says to me it's a pretty high quality quarter. But with that, I'll turn it to Steve.","Stephen M. Robb","Yes, Javier, just stepping back on fiscal 12. What we had previously communicated is we thought that infrastructure and other related costs would be in this range of $50 million to $55 million. We ended the year at about $50 million. And certainly, a significant portion of that did flow through the fourth quarter and is reflected in the number. We don't typically break it out by quarter, but I would just say that we did see about $50 million in costs associated with these projects.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","But when you say a significant amount could be significant, meaning 1\/4 of it? 30% of it? 50% of it? Could you be a little bit more specific because the whole undertone of certain questions has been that you caught advertising spending to beat the number. So if you can clarify that, that will be very helpful.","Steve Austenfeld","Javier, of the $50 million, which again includes not only the IT projects, implementing SAP and International, but it also includes the incremental spending for the R&D facility and fewer other smaller projects. Of the $50 million, more than 1\/4 of it did get expensed in the fourth quarter. And again, it's not all in one line item. It's across a few lines of the P&L, but it was more than 1 quarter, the $50 million spend.","Donald R. Knauss","I just want to reiterate, Javier -- yes, thanks, Javier. But I just want to reiterate, though, we did not cut demand spending. So I mean I think you do have to look at the total bucket, not just the advertising.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","No, that was clear in the release. I just wanted to make sure that we understood the other IT spending issue.","Operator","We go next to Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just to stay on the commodity side, you've given some good details so far, and thank you very much. But gentlemen, any thoughts or just give us a little bit of an update or color if you\u2019ve looked at hedging, any of those commodities that have come down or your exposure to those commodities that have come down. If you\u2019ve looked at taking that pullback and maybe locking that in at this point? And if so, just some details on that.","Stephen M. Robb","Yes, we talked to this before. And we do, do some financial hedging of our commodities. We've got some fairly modest hedge positions in place that were put in place a little while ago on some agricultural commodities. But one of the challenges that we have, and I don't think we're alone in this, is that one of the largest buys that we have is in resins and certain packaging materials. And there just really isn't a market to put financial hedges in place for that. And if you were to do private-party transactions, it would be very expensive because of the underlying volatility of those commodities. So what we tend to do is partner with our suppliers. And we sometimes have contractual terms that allows us to lag a little bit on price movements either up or down. But we don't have significant financial hedging positions in place against the commodity exposure. It's just too expensive to do it.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And I would think that you\u2019d have the same types of flexibility clauses in your contracts with your logistics providers?","Stephen M. Robb","Yes, I don't want to get into that. I would just say that what we've consistently said is that as you see day-to-day and month-to-month movements in energy prices and commodities, that doesn't immediately translate into changes in our P&L. It can take 1 quarter or 2 before that will come through.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just a little bit broader question here, given the way the current tax laws are looked to see tax rate increase, and granted, it's an issue primarily for more individual shareholders. But has there been any preliminary discussions at the board level as far as looking at the way you will return capital going forward, if some of the allocations may change a little bit in the weightings of those different buckets?","Stephen M. Robb","We are always working in partnership with our board and the finance committee to look at what's the most efficient way to return cash back to our shareholders. And I think, again, what we've continued to commit to is continuing to support the dividend in a strong way; and then over time, continue to reevaluate different options for returning cash back to our shareholders if we have excess cash that's building up. I think we've got to go look at what's really going to happen with the fiscal cliff and what's going to happen with the tax reform. I think there's a lot of uncertainty at this point, so it's probably premature to speculate. But I would say that we are always having active discussions with our board and looking to do the things in the best interest of our shareholders.","Lawrence S. Peiros","And I think, Tim, once we get past the election, obviously, in our November and\/or February board meetings, it\u2019ll, obviously, be a topic for discussion. But as Steve said, it's always about how we get the cash back to the shareholders in the most efficient way.","Operator","We'll go next to Nik Modi with UBS.","Nik Modi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just Don, would like to get your viewpoint on the consumer. I mean, no offense to Clorox, but your categories have not been known to be the fastest-growing out there, yet you seem to be doing pretty well with the categories. So I'm just trying to get an understanding. Is this partly a function of the way Clorox is actually addressing the categories in which they compete, i.e. you guys are actually helping grow the categories, or is there some kind of consumer dynamic out there that -- it doesn't match up to what we see on CNN?","Donald R. Knauss","Yes, no I think we still have a very fragile consumer out there, Nik. It's interesting. We're now seeing about -- over -- slightly over 80% of the shopping trips are what we define as fill-in shopping trips, where people are buying less than 15 items. It's still less than -- slightly less than 50% of the total spend. Obviously, people are still doing pantry-loading trips, but it's interesting how many people now are flipping between channels and using these fill-in trips to modulate their cash outlays. So -- and if you look at our categories, I mean, when we hit the low point in December of '10 at negative 2%, we've seen that steady climb back. In the last 3 months, we've hung in very tightly at a plus 0.5. Now that difference between that negative 2% to plus 0.5% in our categories is about $500 million of increased consumption. So I mean, it's modest, but again, you can get lost in the averages too. I mean, we've got the trash categories up plus 2% now; the food category, up plus 2%; Charcoal starting to improve but relatively flat. Home Care is down 1.5%, but it's really dilutables that are driving that down. Spray cleaners are up 4%, where we're strong. So there's a lot -- you can get lost in the averages. But net-net, we're seeing a fragile consumer. They\u2019re shopping with these fill-in trips more frequently. As gasoline spikes, and it had the highest spike last month in 12 years on a monthly basis, we tend to see our categories do a bit better because people stay home more, and we're a stay-home company. So we'll see how it plays out. But the good news for us is I think there is real stabilization in these categories.","Nik Modi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And, Don, just quickly, as you kind of viewed the business as the quarter progress, did you see any significant changes in consumer behavior? I don't know if your analysts can pick that up that quickly, but just as I look at kind of what's been going on out there, it seems like there was something that happened at some point in the midpoint of the quarter. I'm just curious if you saw something similar.","Donald R. Knauss","We didn't see -- I'll let Larry opine on this as well. We didn't see anything in our categories or our particular brands if there was any step function change. We are continuing to see people move into the value channels. Clearly, the Dollar segment continues to be pretty robust. We're continuing to see people where they do pantry-load going to the club channel. So I mean, nothing dramatic for our categories or our brands, Nik, in the middle of the quarter.","Lawrence S. Peiros","I'd say the same thing. No big hurdles one way or the other.","Operator","We'll go next to Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Did you say what Hidden Valley Ranch did in the quarter?","Lawrence S. Peiros","Hidden Valley was up mid-singles.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. It just wasn\u2019t in the written commentary, so I didn't know if there was a problem there. So the S&A costs, broadly speaking, if you kind of look back historically, they kind of hovered in sort of like a 12% of sales range. And now it looks like they're kind of permanently at sort of 14% x the R&D and the SAP spending. Is there opportunity to get that ratio down? Or is there something changed in your philosophy in that line item?","Stephen M. Robb","I think that historically we\u2019ve been in, call it, the range of, well, 12% to 13.5%. I mean, 12% is probably the low watermark. We absolutely believe, as we anniversary this infrastructure spending in fiscal '13, that as we get to fiscal '14 and beyond, there's clearly the opportunity to lower that. And I think what we've said pretty consistently is we\u2019d like to get it to 14% or less. And I think, ideally, we would like to get that less. The fact that it's up is in part because of infrastructure. And also, remember that when we sold the auto business, we had some dis-synergies and some stranded overhead that were there. So over the long run, our expectation is that growth, anniversary-ing the infrastructure investments and even bolt-on acquisitions to give us growth that we can extract synergies from, all of that should help us get the SG&A back to levels that we think in the long-term [ph].","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then the year-over-year change in the other expense income line, it went from income to expense year-over-year. What drove that? Is it going to be an expense next year? Or do have any color on that?","Stephen M. Robb","Yes, on a full year basis, the biggest driver -- there's really 2. One is we had some asset sales in -- you\u2019re talking fiscal '11 versus '12. We had some asset sales in fiscal '11 that didn't repeat, and that threw off over $10 million. We also had some TSA income. This is transition services income from the auto business that's been slowly winding down, so that's the biggest change. I think as you look to next year, it should get to more of a historical normal level.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So like the $4 million a quarter is kind of the right number?","Steve Austenfeld","Bill, it's really hard to project because, hence its name, other income and expenses, there\u2019s just a myriad of things that go through it every quarter. It's really hard to predict. Probably, if you want to peg it at about flat but recognizing it could be plus or minus $5 million in a quarter. That's probably the best we can guide you to at this point.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then as kind of you look at the split between volume and sales as the next year progresses, is it fair to say the back half is going to be much more volume-weighted? Because I think most of the big price increases roll off next quarter, at least in a year-over-year basis. I mean, there\u2019s some incremental Pine-Sol stuff, but is that a fair assumption?","Steve Austenfeld","Yes, at this point, we really don't see -- I think this comment was made earlier as well in relation to sales. But I would say the same is true in volume in that we're not really expecting to see dramatic variances quarter-to-quarter. Part of it may be that -- we do have some pricing still planned for this next year, which may have a moderating effect on volume in some categories where we take it. As we noted, it's not going to be as high or as extensive as it was in fiscal '12 at least as we see it right now. But that may be causing some of the moderation as well. And the fiscal year\u2019s got a long way to go. I think the best we can say at this point is each quarter's volumes are going to be roughly within the same range as the full year.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got you. Why wouldn't the volumes snap back if the pricing was rolling off? Because it was big pricing that\u2019s lapping.","Stephen M. Robb","Well, in some categories, we're expecting that it will. But in others, you may not see that. And again, International is low right now, particularly with some of the Latin American economies. That may be at a slower growth rate than what we've seen recently because of some of their economic challenges.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, got you. And then one last one, if I can. Now that we get sort of the multichannel data from Nielsen and IRI, have you guys taken a stab at what percentage of your U.S. business will now be tracked? I know you used to say it was below 40% or something, but do you know what the new number is now?","Lawrence S. Peiros","I haven't seen all the data. I'm actually scheduled to see it next week. But it should be about probably 70% to 75%. So the places that it will be excluded will be places like a home hardware, like Home Depot and Lowe's. I think it may be a portion of the Dollar channel, and Costco would probably be the big misses.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And the reason I asked is that there was actually -- so we got the data for the quarter, and it actually showed much weaker sales in your reported. So is there a little difference between sell-in and sell-through in the quarter?","Stephen M. Robb","No.","Lawrence S. Peiros","I don't understand.","Donald R. Knauss","I don't understand that, Bill. But...","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, maybe the data\u2019s just -- they\u2019re still working through it, so it\u2019s\u2026","Lawrence S. Peiros","We\u2019re still cleaning the data. And what we always find when you go to a different data source, you always have skews and things that are miscategorized. So we will have better information on the next call in terms of what we look like and probably be able to give you some comparisons in terms of coverage and difference in trends. Overall, based on what we know, the trends are relatively the same. Can't speak to a single quarter, but over the long term, they're relatively the same.","Donald R. Knauss","Bill, just to clarify your question on Hidden Valley, I want to make sure we're clear. The business did grow mid singles for the full year. It was flattish in the quarter.","Operator","And we'll go next to Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital Markets.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","My questions have been answered.","Operator","Then we'll go to Chris Ferrara with Bank of America.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Guys, can you talk a little bit more about International? I know we have a number of different issues going on. But can you just talk about some of the big ones and put a little more color around them? I guess, talk about -- is there any need for more structural change in any of these markets?","Lawrence S. Peiros","I think we talked about the overall International strategy when we had the analyst meeting. And I think overall, we feel good about the past growth trends on the top line, and we feel good about what looks like good from top line growth over the long-term future. But we do have a margin challenge. And it really, probably, ties mostly to the fact that we have 2 big businesses in Latin America that just have a difficult kind of economic situation. It's a combination of very high inflation, usually double digits, often more than 20% and some form of price controls within those countries that affect our ability to price, as well as sometimes affect our supply chain. So that's really the issue. So our International folks are incredibly focused on trying to build sustainable structural margin. Obviously, the SAP implementation that we're going through today will be a key enabler to that over the long term. We\u2019re in the go-live phase this year. But as that system comes on stream, it will give us a lot more visibility and a lot more capability to go after the cost side of the business. But that's essentially what's going on. The good news is the consumer demand is still there. The categories, particularly in Latin America, are still pretty healthy from a dollar sales standpoint. The volume is not quite as strong, but still it's increasing. So kind of the consumer fundamentals are good. It's the difficult government policies and economic factors that are getting in our way.","Donald R. Knauss","Yes. I think what we feel good about, Chris, is the fact that, as Larry said, the categories are still fairly robust growing in the mid-singles. Our own sales numbers, despite Venezuela, are in the mid-high-singles, so we still feel good about that, and we gained almost 1 full share point in Latin America in the last year. So -- and that's 2\/3 of our International business, as you know. So I think we still feel very good about that. I think, to Larry's point, once we get our SAP implementation done, and that will be done by the end of this calendar year, we'll feel very good about the value capture we can get out of that. [indiscernible]","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, that's good. I appreciate the color. And on the manufacturing logistics line, I mean, obviously, diesel\u2019s a big piece of that, right, and we saw it tick down in Q4. It looks like it's running with diesel prices. I mean, is there a reason to think -- is there a reason why that line of diesel does what it's been doing, why -- as we flatten out at least, not that diesel\u2019s going down, but as it flattened, that it wouldn't look more like the fiscal '11 kind of rate of change in manufacturing logistics?","Stephen M. Robb","Well, if diesel prices in fact continue to -- if they start to soften and continue to soften, you'll get some relief on that line, and you might -- we might start getting back to the numbers we saw 1 year or 2 ago. I would also just mention, though, in that line, it includes a lot of inflationary pressures, big portion of which is coming from International. And as Larry commented, we're looking at a lot of countries we operate in with double-digit inflation. So we fully expect that you're going to see costs on that line continue to march up, driven primarily by inflation. And then we\u2019ll have to see how the diesel plays through.","Operator","We go next to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I'll just keep it brief. I was curious about why there was mention of lower merchandising in both Bleach and Cat Litter in the quarter. I'm guessing Bleach was maybe ahead of holding back the spending until you move forward with the concentrated launch. So I wondered if that's correct. And then pacing for that launch, how much of the country can you cover in 1 or 2 quarters, and then the merchandising in Cat Litter?","Lawrence S. Peiros","Yes, the merchandising shifts are what I would call kind of the normal ebb and flow. And maybe, because you have particularly good events in the base period, and you\u2019re not replicating that, but I would say I would not describe it as anything fundamental nor would I describe it as preparation for moving to the concentrated formula of bleach or anything like that. But it is a typical, normal ebb and flow that we get with different customers just based on our merchandising plans or competitive plans or whatever it might be. Specific to the conversion on Clorox liquid bleach, I think we laid out all the detail on that in the analyst meeting, but it's a four-wave kind of roll out over the course of this year. So the first wave is going out, essentially as we speak, to the Midwest. And then the last wave goes out in March. So by the end of the year, we'll be fully converted, but the nature of the supply chain and the difficulty in changing shelf sets and things like that basically necessitates that we do this over 4 waves versus all at once.","Donald R. Knauss","I think, Lauren, just to add some more color to that, I think the trade reaction we talked a little bit about has been very supportive of this. Obviously, we're getting about 25% more pack out on the shelf with the reduction in the package size. But the new planograms are integrating new items as well, and I think this will eliminate one of the big issues we always talk about, which is weekend out-of-stocks on bleach. So the trade is very supportive, and we're seeing everybody else move as well, so which is a good thing.","Steve Austenfeld","And we go to the Northeast in January, so you'll be able to see it in January on the shelf.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Good. One thing that surprised me was, Don, you said you see others moving as well. Do others have the technology? Does the private label have the technology?","Donald R. Knauss","They don't have the technology that we have, but they can offer a bleach which is similar to ours. It just won\u2019t have the stability on the shelf over time that ours does. So we will have an advantage, particularly as the product ages. But they can produce a product that\u2019s a little bit more concentrated in a smaller bottle.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ian Gordon with S&P Capital IQ.","Ian Gordon","Just on the bleach rollout, so are you physically losing shelf space? Or you kind of alluded to putting more stuff in there and how might the consumer perceive some of that? And I just want to ask on Venezuela. If you can help us understand why it's still down double digits. I think one is your world care competitors saw that phenomenon in the March quarter when the retailers were holding back their orders in advance of -- they didn't know what the prices were going to be, but then it seems to have normalized in the June quarter. So I'm wondering if you can just give us a little clarity on that.","Lawrence S. Peiros","So what we're seeing in terms of the bleach shelf sets, and obviously, we're just rolling out -- what we're seeing is essentially the shelf size has maintained. In other words, the bleach section hasn't changed in size, but their ability to get packed out on the shelf, number of bottles on the shelf is obviously increased by about 1\/3, which is the concentration rate. And bleach is one of those -- our 96-ounce current Clorox Bleach is one of the fastest-selling unit items in grocery stores. So the out-of-stock issues over weekends can be a problem, so this is going to be a big boon just in terms of reducing out-of-stock. So what we're seeing is we typically have as much and sometimes more shelf space, and the overall set about the same. In terms of Venezuela, I was there just last week. It's a fun place to visit. Essentially, what we're seeing is the consumer demand is not robust at this point. Consumers are a lot -- are under a lot of economic pressure. We also had some supply constraints, particularly in one part of our business that was imported from another Latin American country, which the government no longer allowed. So there was some issue with some supply shortages, which we've fixed. That's part of the equation as well. But I would say that the underlying consumption by consumers is pretty flattish at best. So what we haven't seen is the reduced pricing generated the incremental sales in that country as yet, and that\u2019s I think because the overall economic picture with [indiscernible] consumers is not that positive.","Donald R. Knauss","And I think the other thing I would say is that the price control implementation was staggered by category, it wasn't all done at the same time. So depends on what category you're competing in, whether it was implemented in March, April, May, so there was some variability too. So I think, the time we get into this quarter, we'll start to see what the impact on consumption is.","Stephen M. Robb","Just building on that for clarity. So while the business is down substantially on the full year, the fourth quarter, it was down, but it was down a lot less than what we saw in the third quarter. So I would say that the trends are improving, but still a long way to go.","Operator","We go next to Jason Gere with RBC Capital Markets.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a follow-up, I guess, on the Laundry category. I know you talked about the Bleach and the merchandising as part of, I guess, the shortfall in the volumes there. But on Clorox 2, you did talk about the price impacts and how that's still affecting the category. And I guess, I was just wondering how much Clorox 2 was actually down. Compare that to last quarter, is sequentially the category getting better? Or is this one of those categories where you're really just seeing the economic environment pushing people away from the category, and obviously, the pricing that you took a year ago kind of led people on that path?","Donald R. Knauss","Category volume is soft, and our business is soft in Q -- on Clorox 2. It's soft from a volume standpoint, but we're up from a sales standpoint. And so essentially, what you're seeing there is the just typical profile of a price increase, where you do see some volume decline, there is some sensitivity to price increases, but you're making up for it in your pricing.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Are there categories within the portfolio that are having the same type of impact as with Clorox 2? Is this really kind of an isolated incident, where, I mean, you've seen -- typically, when you take price volume, obviously, suffers near term, but usually it's after 1 quarter or 2 that the volumes start to come back, people adjust to the pricing. This one, obviously, you've said that it's taking a little bit longer. So is this really kind of an isolated incident? Or is there any other category that you want to call out that you're still going through some of the pains as well?","Lawrence S. Peiros","No. Actually, I wouldn't say that it ends in a quarter or even 2 -- unless all of our brands. I mean, typically, we linger for a year as the pricing takes effect, and it's only year 2 where we typically see a full recovery.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Maybe your innovation is that good that it just disguises it in my mind.","Donald R. Knauss","I think in both the topical stain remover category and bleach, these categories really hit a low, Jason, about late 2010, when they were both down in the 8% to 10%, 12% range. And now they're both -- bleach, for example, has been up about -- flattish to up 1% to 2%. Now this is in sales dollars about for the last couple of months. And the stain removers have been from negative almost 12% 1.5 years ago to about negative 2%. And so we're seeing quite a bit of improvement and stabilization in the category. But to Larry\u2019s point, I think it takes a while to sort it out.","Operator","We'll take a follow-up from Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.","Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Just a follow-up to the -- to your follow-up, I'm a little confused about you saying that volume in the U.S. was up 1. Does that include the acquisitions?","Lawrence S. Peiros","Yes.","Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And without the acquisitions, would it have been negative 1?","Lawrence S. Peiros","It would have been, I think, 0.5 point down, something like that.","Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And then the other question, and I don't think you commented on this, did you -- have you seen any deterioration in your business starting in June or into July in terms of weakening at the consumer level or increased promotional activity? Just any change recently?","Lawrence S. Peiros","Actually nothing fundamental. I think the only that's been changing a little bit, as we've talked about the Glad category, we\u2019ve seen a little bit more trade dealing. But no big fundamental consumer change, at least based on what we can see, in our category.","Donald R. Knauss","Okay. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. As I said earlier, we obviously feel very good about the close to the fiscal year, and we certainly are confident about the plans we have for fiscal '13, and we\u2019ll look forward to updating everyone later this fall. Take care.","Operator","And that does conclude today's call. Again, thank you for your participation.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call. Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference.","Lisah Burhan","Thanks, Sharon. Welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Happy Halloween. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, our Chairman and CEO; and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet. And a replay of the call will be available for seven days on our website thecloroxcompany.com.","On today's call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA, organic sales growth and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enable investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations.","Reconciliations with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available on our website as well as in our SEC filings. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release. Please also recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcome could differ materially from management's expectations and plans.","I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.","I'll start by covering our top line commentary, discussing highlights in each of our segments. Kevin will then address our financial results as well as our outlook for the fiscal year 2020. Finally, Benno will offer his perspective and we'll close with Q&A.","For the total company, Q1 sales decreased 4%. The results are on top of solid sales growth in the year ago period. Organic sales were down 2%. I'll now go through our results by segment. In our Cleaning segment, sales decreased 2% for the quarter. Our Professional Products business delivered strong sales growth, driven by a successful back-to-school campaign particularly in the e-commerce channel. We also continue to see strength and longevity of our innovation in this business, with platforms such as Clorox Hydrogen Peroxide and Clorox Fuzion, both disinfectants used in health care setting, delivering double-digit growth even four years after their initial launch.","In Home Care, sales were down slightly with volume growth offset by unfavorable mix and increased performance bifurcation between tracked and non-tracked channels. Shipments of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes grew solidly for the quarter with growth in non-tracked channels, outpacing tracked channels by a wide margin. Our investments were fully implemented are working and helping grow the category.","Our near-term focus is to strengthen our results consistently across all channels. Additionally, as highlighted in our IGNITE Strategy launch, we have a strong innovation plan based on bigger, stickier platforms, with Clorox Compostable Cleaning Wipes launching in late Q2.","Our Scentiva platform continues to perform well with high single digit volume growth three years after its initial launch. Lastly, within the Cleaning segment, our Laundry business sales were down for the quarter, driven primarily by distribution losses of Clorox liquid bleach in select retailers coupled with increased competitive promotion. We're addressing this with innovation on multiple fronts, including launch of a full line of compacted bleach product in spring 2020.","During the same period, we're also launching a sanitizing innovation platform, including a trigger, spray aerosol spray and a liquid laundry additive product, bringing the strong Clorox equity to the fast-growing sanitization segment.","Turning to the Household segment, Q1 sales were down 14%, driven mainly by declines in Bags and Wraps and Charcoal. In Bags and Wraps, Q1 sales were down double digits, driven by the same factors we discussed previously, wider price gaps as well as distribution losses in select portions of the portfolio. Higher trade investments on Glad trash bags are now in place. We're seeing sequential improvements in volume as well as market share and we're focused on building on this momentum.","As expected, Charcoal sales were down double digits this quarter, driven by lower shipments. The sales decline also reflected higher trade spending, part of an ongoing effort to reduce market inventory from a weak 2019 grilling season and to gear up a stronger 2020 grilling season. Building on a strong grilling category consumption and a normalized inventory level going into the upcoming grilling season, we'll be focused on executing our plan to turn this business around.","In RenewLife, sales declined double digits due to category slowdown and persisting consumption headwinds. As part of our effort to return this business to growth, we're continuing to focus on engaging retailers in support of our category growth plans, supported by a full brand relaunch next calendar year.","Finally, our Cat Litter business was down slightly, lapping strong double-digit sales growth in the year ago quarter. Similar to the other businesses, we're seeing much stronger sales and share performance in non-tracked channels than in tracked channels. Our Fresh Step Clean Paws innovation platform continues to grow strongly beyond its first year. So, we'll lean in further with dedicated advertising and continued trial-building activities.","In our Lifestyle segment, sales grew 4%, reflecting growth in three of our four businesses. Burt's Bees delivered double-digit sales growth, fueled by strength in its core categories of Lip Care and Face Care. Successful innovation in Lip Care including the new watermelon lip balm that was the number one overall flavor at a key retailer and mass channel drove share growth for a 19th consecutive quarter and reinforced the brand's position as the number one overall lip balm in the category.","In Face Care, there were record shipments of products such as face masks and pore cleansers as well as relaunched sensitive skin care line. The business also has a strong pipeline of innovation including a hemp line as well as men's line launching in Q3. For Burt's Bees, a combination of pricing and innovation has been a successful formula in driving strong category growth.","Food sales were up for the quarter as well, reflecting higher shipments of dry Hidden Valley seasonings and dressings. The results were on top of strong sales growth in the year ago quarter. The Ready-to-Eat Dips innovation remained on track with plans to increase demand-building investments to expand usage occasion. The brand also extended its streak of share growth to 19 quarters.","Brita sales were up slightly for the quarter behind higher shipments of our new Brita bottles and Brita Longlast water filtration systems, which performed strongly in the e-commerce and mass channels. The Brita business continued the streak of solid consistent volume growth dating back a year.","Finally, sales for Nutranext were down this quarter, reflecting growth in our strategic brands and a double-digit decrease in our nonstrategic brands. Our strategic brands grew behind strong shipments of Neocell and Natural Vitality. The decrease in the nonstrategic part of this portfolio is mainly driven by our decision to exit the private label business that came with the acquisition.","Moving up the initial integration phase of Nutranext, we're now working on optimizing the portfolio, focusing on a few strategic brands, representing more than 80% of the portfolio. We continue to be excited about the growth prospects of this business.","Lastly, turning to international. Sales were flat for the quarter with volume growth, innovation and the benefit of price increases, offset by about eight points of unfavorable foreign currency impact. Despite the strong headwinds, we grew sales in Latin America and the International segment grew sales 8% on an organic basis. Consistent with our IGNITE Strategy that aims to improve profitability in international we continue to invest selectively in profitable platforms and see the returns on businesses like Burt's Bees and Cat Litter.","Now, I'll turn it over to Kevin, who will discuss our Q1 financial performance and our outlook for FY '20.","Kevin Jacobsen","Thank you, Lisah, and thank you everyone for joining us today. First quarter results came in generally as expected, as we continue to work through the challenges in our Bags and Wraps and Charcoal businesses. Importantly as we noted in our press release, we remain on track for fiscal year 2020 and confirmed our outlook.","Turning to our first quarter results, sales decreased 4% reflecting about 3 points of higher trade spending about 2 points of unfavorable mix and about 2 points of foreign currency headwinds. These factors were partially offset by about 3 points of pricing benefit. On an organic sales basis, first quarter sales decreased 2%, primarily driven by our Bags and Wraps and Charcoal businesses.","Gross margin for the quarter increased 60 basis points to 44% compared to 43.4% for the year ago quarter. First quarter gross margin included 180 basis points of benefit from cost savings and a 120 basis point benefit from pricing partially offset by 180 basis points of higher trade spending.","I'd like to note that a portion of the benefits to gross margin was related to timing. First quarter gross margin also reflected favorability in commodity and logistics costs. And while it's still early in the fiscal year, we're encouraged by the cost favorability we're seeing in these markets.","Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of sales came in at 14% compared to 13.6% due to reduced operating leverage. Importantly year-over-year selling and administrative spending for the quarter declined. Advertising and sales promotion investment levels as a percentage of sales were about flat with spending for our U.S. retail business coming in at about 10% of sales.","Our first quarter effective tax rate was about 22% equal to the year ago quarter. Net of all these factors, we delivered diluted net earnings per share of $1.59 versus $1.62 in the year ago quarter, a decrease of 2%. Turning to year-to-date cash flow, net cash provided by operations in the first quarter came in at $271 million versus $259 million in the prior quarter, an increase of 5%. ","Now I'll turn to our fiscal year 2020 outlook. As we communicated in our October 2, press release we expect this year's sales to be down low single digits to up 1% reflecting our recently updated assumption of about 2 points of impact from unfavorable foreign currencies, primarily from Argentina.","As I mentioned at our Analyst Day, we previously assumed devaluation of the Argentine peso at about 25%. And now our expectations are closer to 50%. Importantly, our fiscal year organic sales outlook remains unchanged reflecting 1% to 3% organic sales growth driven by innovation and our expectation for stronger business performance on Bags and Wraps and Charcoal in the back half of the fiscal year.","Turning to gross margin, we continue to expect fiscal year margin to be down slightly reflecting our recently updated assumption on foreign currencies. Our fiscal year gross margin outlook continues to reflect our expectation for additional supply chain investments to support long-term value creation including our investment in the rollout of Clorox Liquid Bleach compaction in the spring of 2020.","We continue to expect fiscal year advertising and sales promotion investment levels to be at about 10% of sales. We also continue to expect selling and administrative expenses to come in at about 14% of sales.","Consistent with our fiscal year gross margin assumptions, we expect fiscal year EBIT margin to be down slightly. Our fiscal year 2020 outlook continues to anticipate our fiscal year effective tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 23%.","Net of all these factors, we continue to expect fiscal year 2020 diluted EPS to be in the range of $6.05 to $6.25. In closing, first quarter results came in generally as anticipated. We continue to work through the short-term challenges, we're facing in Bags and Wraps and Charcoal and continue to expect improvement in our overall results in the back half of the fiscal year.","We're certainly pleased that our cost savings program is off to a good start contributing significantly to our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin expansion.","Looking ahead, we'll continue to address short-term challenges while executing against the strategic choices we have made under our IGNITE Strategy. As we said at the Analyst Day, our focus with IGNITE is to create a virtuous cycle of generating fuel to continue investing to drive superior consumer value. We have a long track record of doing this successfully. And I continue to believe that once we work through the challenges we're facing in Bags and Wraps and Charcoal, Clorox will be in a position to deliver results that are more in line with our long-term financial goals.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Benno.","Benno Dorer ","Hello everyone, and thank you Kevin. Here are my three key messages. First, Q1 results came in generally as expected. As we discussed last quarter, we anticipate fiscal year 2020 first half sales to be lower than the second half, as we continue working through the persistent challenges in Bags and Wraps and Charcoal.","I am pleased we delivered volume growth and gross margin expansion in three out of four segments. And notwithstanding a tougher foreign currency environment, which drove flat sales in our international business for the quarter, our international team continues to make strong progress, delivering 8% organic sales growth and the seventh consecutive quarter of profit growth.","Now clearly, we are not satisfied with our top line results. I do want to reinforce that improving Bags and Wraps and Charcoal is a top priority for us. We are actively working with customers to significantly strengthen our business plans with a keen eye on sustainable long-term improvement.","This includes innovation that we believe will deliver meaningful value to our consumers and categories. Importantly, I'm pleased about the green shoots we're starting to see on these businesses. And I continue to anticipate improvement on Bags and Wraps and Charcoal in the second half of the fiscal year.","My second message is that we're on track to deliver our outlook for the fiscal year 2020. This fiscal year brings another robust pipeline of innovation, led by the Compaction of Clorox Liquid Bleach as well as the launch of Clorox Compostable Cleaning Wipes, Clorox Fabric Sanitizer, Kingsford Pellets and several innovations in Bags and Wraps and Natural Personal Care.","We will drive awareness and trial of these new products, while continuing to invest behind significant upside opportunity in ongoing innovation platforms, such as Clorox Scentiva, Fresh Step Clean Paws, Brita Filtering Water Bottles and Hidden Valley Ready-to-Eat Dips.","I believe that consumer and retailer engagement in the strength of our innovation program along with stronger business plans for Bags and Wraps and Charcoal, supported by our commitment to excellent execution will contribute to improved overall results in the back half of the fiscal year. As I also mentioned previously, our fiscal year 2020 outlook continues to reflect our commitment to balancing our shorter-term focus on addressing the challenges on Bags and Wraps and Charcoal with strategic plans aimed at driving long-term profitable growth.","Finally, my third message is this. I'm confident our new IGNITE Strategy will guide us in our ongoing pursuit of delivering long-term shareholder value. As we discussed at Analyst Day earlier this month, innovation to strengthen and extend our competitive advantage is front and center in our IGNITE Strategy. The integrated choices we've established for IGNITE create a virtuous circle of fueling growth and investing behind innovation to deliver superior value.","By the end of fiscal year 2020, we expect to have begun activating brand purpose on all major brands, laying the groundwork to drive significant marketing ROI in the future. We expect to have engaged all major customers in new ways to create frictionless shopping experiences in-store and online leading to meaningful opportunities to drive category growth.","We also expect to have surpassed 150 basis points of annual cost savings, supported by meaningful productivity improvements, moving steadily towards our new annual cost savings target of about 175 basis points. And finally, we expect to have made significant investments to drive stickier multi-year innovation platforms that differentiate our products and brands with a robust innovation pipeline in the back half of fiscal 2020.","Everything we do is in service of superior value, because we know it's the key to winning with consumers. And of course, we'll continue our focus on growing the right way with ESG integrated into our business, so that we're also creating value for society.","A recent announcement to join the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's New Plastics Economy Global Commitment is an example of this. As we reinforced at Analyst Day, IGNITE innovates for good growth, growth that's profitable, sustainable and responsible.","Operator, you may now open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Dorer. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America.","Olivia Tong","Good morning -- good afternoon. In terms of just near-term trajectory, I know you have quite a few initiatives like for second half across several businesses, but what about Q2? You talked a little bit about green shoots. Do any of those help already, or are those all sort of second half weighted?","Kevin Jacobsen","Hey, Olivia, it's Kevin. Good morning. Let me see if I can take that one. What I expect in Q2, is you'll see improved organic sales growth. Now having said that, I expect our Q2 results to look similar to Q1, with a worsening FX environment, but improving organic sales growth and really because we're going to see improvements on both Glad and Charcoal. As you know, those are the two challenged businesses that we're working to turn around and I expect to see improvements next quarter.","Benno Dorer","And then Olivia, of course, that means the growth will come in the back half. First of all, they'll have easier comps. I think everybody is aware of that. But we're also beginning to anniversary distribution losses in Q3. And as you know, we're very focused on strengthening distribution now. Two things are most important. We need Glad and Kingsford to improve and we expect improvement on both. And we're seeing green shoots I've mentioned that. Kingsford is growing mid-single digits in consumption lately.","And Glad is starting to grow share where our plans are implemented by end quarter. So we feel good about that. Then, of course, we have a robust innovation program in the back half as stated. So the back half is where improvements are expected. We realize we have work to do this, but there's enough there to give us confidence.","Olivia Tong","Got it. That's helpful. If I could ask a question about tracked versus non-tracked? I mean the spread between the two seems to be increasing. Obviously online continues to be a big driver. But is it growing even faster than it had been? Is that accelerating, or are there more efforts or just more opportunity across a broad spectrum of non-tracked channels whether it's club online or other retailers?","Benno Dorer","Yes. What we've commented on is that the spread between tracked and non-tracked is indeed widening, right? And I think that's for two reasons. First -- and it was probably most evident in Home Care where we've seen the business down slightly but growing double digits in non-tracked channels. First of all, I would say, the consumer in part in our categories is migrating towards non-tracked channels. That's where a lot of the category growth is. We do know that our performance also market share-wise is better in non-tracked channels. And perhaps at this point, as we think about the post-pricing bumpiness that we talked about you'll find more of that which relates to distribution losses and perhaps less merchandising in tracked channels than in non-tracked channels. And what that gives us is confidence in the expected back half turnaround because we know that where our brands are able to perform, they do. And that's why the gap between track and untracked has been widening of late.","Olivia Tong","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse.","Kaumil Gajrawala","Hi, everybody. A couple of questions. I think first on the issues over the recent period has been in trash bags and in wipes and such but now we're -- you mentioned distribution losses and in bleach as well some tough comps I suppose on litter. But it looks like some of the issues are expanding beyond some of the categories that were kind of initially in the area of focus. Can you talk about what's going on there if there's something connected between the various categories that we should be aware of?","Benno Dorer","Thanks Kaumil. No, the issue remains Glad and Kingsford. If you think about the rest of the portfolio, there's actually quite a bit of strength. Burt's grew double-digits. Food, 19 quarters of share growth. The Professional business growing high single digits. Brita is now our fastest-growing business in terms of share. Parts of Home Care are seeing strength. Toilets, which is a strategic segment, has an all-time high in shipments. International performing well. So it's really Glad and Kingsford. If you take out Glad and Kingsford actually we grew organic sales for the quarter.","Now I will tell you that if you just look at share, of course, there's always ups and downs, right? But what I'd tell you is, if you look at it over the longer term, which I think is perhaps helpful, we tracked eight businesses in terms of share. And six out of those eight if you compare the last quarter against three years ago are in line or higher.","Home Care is in line coming off of 14 quarters of share growth. Bleach is higher than three years ago. Hidden Valley is higher than three years ago. Brita is doing well. Litter is about in line. Burt's is higher. It's really coal and trash.","So, no news on the portfolio front. Clearly, not everything is performing as well as we want to, but much of the short-term noise can be attributed to the well-illustrated issues around lower merchandising and distribution losses post pricing. And as such we believe that they will be temporary.","Kaumil Gajrawala","Okay. Understood. And then just finally on the expectations for the back half. It seems to be rooted in the return of distribution from some of the losses from last year. At what point -- do you know now if you're going to be put back in? Or at what point will you have a good sense on if we're going to be going into a period where there's distribution gains as opposed to distribution losses?","Benno Dorer","Yeah. Back half clearly does assume that some of the distribution losses, which we're anniversarying in Q3 will be mitigated and that will start to make progress there along with easier comps and a strong innovation program. Categories generally are healthy.","On the distribution side, we've commented that we're not -- we haven't been where we want to be in the last 12 months post pricing. And our focus is to make those temporary. Discussions are happening this quarter, so that's all work in progress at this point. Reasons that give us optimism as we're focused on achieving these improvements starting in 2020 is that we do have a long track record of partnering with retailers. It's obviously a very strong organizational focus area right now.","I'm looking at our business plans for 2020 in particular on Glad and Kingsford. They need to be better and they will be better including robust innovation. And then our new IGNITE Strategy of course gives us plenty of partnership opportunities around creating categories for the future to drive profitable growth for retailers. So, work in progress. Many of them are happening as we speak, but a big area of organizational focus now.","Kaumil Gajrawala","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","Hey, good morning folks. Good afternoon I should say, by this point, the day is all blended together now. A quick housekeeping question. The logistics and manufacturing line in your gross margin bridge, it's been sort of a persistent drag for quite some time. But it's now moderated for two consecutive quarters to be reasonably marginal now in the first quarter. Is that a trend line we can expect to continue?","Kevin Jacobsen","Yeah, Jason. I would say, I'd separate transportation from manufacturing. On the transportation side, as you mentioned, we're pleased to see favorable transportation rates for the first time and probably the better part of two years. We have about 20 bps of favorability, as we're seeing a decline in the spot carrier market.","We talked about this before, but just as a reminder. About 85% of our transportation is contracted with our eight carriers and those rates are set. But we are seeing a reduction in the spot market that I believe will continue. It also bodes well that as we renegotiate rates in the future that that may generate ongoing benefit as we look out to fiscal year 2021 and beyond.","So I started the year thinking transportation would be up low single-digits. And what I'm seeing right now, I suspect it will be flat to down low single-digits, so a nice improvement there.","And then manufacturing, a little favorable this time. We had some delays in some of our investments for our new litter plant. You'll see that play out later on in the year. As I mentioned, we're going to have about 20 bps to 25 bps of investment in the supply chain. It was pretty light in Q1, but I still expect to spend that money in the year. So, we'll pick that up later in the year.","Jason English","All right. That's helpful. And I guess I want to come back to the question. Everything excluding Charcoal and wipes, which don't seem to be really a whole lot worse than I was expecting. But your Cleaning segment, it's one of the weakest quarters in a very, very long time. And if Professional is growing high singles, it implies that the consumer-facing side of that business is now contracting somewhere in the 3% to 4% range.","I'd love some context and color on what's causing that business to kind of get derailed. And as we look at the data, I think your biggest innovation platform in recent years has been Scentiva. And in Nielsen, if Scentiva is now declining high singles even with sort of a 14-point benefit coming from the Swiffer refills it begs the question of whether or not the issue there is just a lack of innovation effectiveness. I'd love your opinion on all those fronts. Thank you.","Benno Dorer","Yes. First of all, Jason I'll strongly disagree with the statement that the business is derailed. I'm actually okay with where the business is at this point. And let me maybe take the two in turn.","First of all laundry additives. The sales was down behind post-pricing distribution losses. We have anticipated those. We have commented on those several times and talked about them consistently. If you look at the bleach share for instance, I quoted shares versus three years ago because sometimes it helps to look at the forest but not look at trees.","Bleach share is up 1.5 points versus three years ago. I hope that provides perspective. And now we're gearing up for a significant innovation in the spring, which includes bleach compaction and a new platform in the fast-growing laundry sanitizer segment behind us, an equity that is particularly well fitting there.","Home Care, if you just look at shares, it's coming off of 3.5 years of share growth. It's normal to have some up and down, especially post pricing. Again loss in distribution well documented. At the same time volume grew in Q1.","Sales is down due to non-tracked channels. They outgrew tracked channels by a wide margin. Out \u2013 non-tracked channels grew double-digits in absolute. So that's a negative mix effect. Wipes is growing mid-single-digits. Scentiva for the record is growing, which perhaps helps you understand the strength in non-tracked channels.","And if you look at the past 13 weeks tracked channel share is lower than a year ago but it's higher than past 52 weeks. So we're making progress. I'll focus on this category.","Obviously, an important category for us is on profitable growth. We will continue to activate the Clorox brand purpose, which has been working so well. And of course, we have a lot of innovation that I know you're well aware of lined up in the back half including our Compostable Cleaning Wipes launch, which is starting to go out in Q2 and then widely available in Q3. So, ups and downs, but I feel solid about where Cleaning is and optimistic about the back half with all the innovation coming in.","Jason English","Okay, thanks a lot. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Operator","Next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi.","Wendy Nicholson","Hi, good afternoon. My first question just housekeeping. How much longer do we think the private label exit in the Nutranext business is going to continue to be a headwind? I know you said like 80% of the business is healthy and good. But just when should we expect that headwind to go away?","And then my second question is just taking a step back on the fixed initiatives you're undertaking for Glad and Charcoal, are obviously huge and important. And between the two of them those are I think what 15%, 20% of your revenues. And so I'm just surprised that your guidance both for the S&A line on the P&L and advertising isn't higher than normal.","I know 10% for advertising and 14% for S&A are kind of your long-term objectives. But I'm kind of questioning why in this year where it's so important to get those two big businesses really back on track you wouldn't sort of take a holiday from your long-term targets and just say \"This year we're going to spend more and absolutely make sure we get those businesses righted.\" Thanks.","Kevin Jacobsen","Hey, Wendy, maybe I'll take the first question you had on RenewLife and how long as we exit some of that businesses both private label and contract manufacturing. I would expect to see that a drag for the balance of this year. We will continue to step out of that business over the next several quarters. And that's a pretty natural sort of transition out as we use that capacity for our own needs. And so you should expect to see that drag for the next several quarters.","Benno Dorer","And then the second part Wendy, more money is not the option here certainly on the people and on the advertising side. If you think about Glad, what we're trying to do is fix the widened price gaps. And we feel good about the progress that we're making. And towards the end of the quarter and also in October where the plans are now fully implemented, which they are we're seeing a return to share growth. But the increased spending there is going into trade where we are spending more, but we feel good about advertising and certainly people.","On Kingsford, it's all about better plans. As we've commented at Analyst Day, it's less of a money issue. And again, we've certainly spent quite a bit of trade money this last quarter to get rid of excess inventory. But we're pleased with the amount of money that we're spending behind those two businesses. As we've commented in the past, we're always willing to look at spending. We're also willing to lean into spending where that's indicated important and necessary. But we don't think that more advertising or people is the solution here. We're certainly spending more trade. But, the progress starts to be evident and we expect more progress to be had in the back half.","Wendy Nicholson","And I'm just surprised. I guess the feedback from the retailers. I mean there's always -- the hope I know is to regain some lost share. But there's also a hope, I assume, of growing the category particularly in Charcoal. And I'm surprised that part of the conversation with the retailers isn't, hey, Clorox, you've got the biggest and most well-known brand. Please spend more money on advertising to get people to stop ordering their ribs from Grubhub and cook them at home. Is that not part of the conversation?","Benno Dorer","So part of the conversation certainly is engaging the consumer. And like I said, Wendy, we spent quite a bit against the consumer. And we're making sure that the money counts with retailers as well. But if you think about the Charcoal category, the Charcoal category past 13 weeks, I believe, is up double-digits. And our business while it's still a little softer in shares is growing mid-single digits. So the conversations that we have are starting to bear fruit.","And we're certainly seeing in this category as well as in other categories like Glad and in wipes, the strong correlation between the health of our categories and the health of our brands. If our brands are doing well, the categories generally tend to perform better. If our brands are not doing well, the categories are performing worse. And that very part certainly, is a key component of our discussions with retailers.","Wendy Nicholson","Got it. Thank you.","Kevin Jacobsen","If I just broaden that a little bit from just Kingsford and Glad. The other perspective, I'd offer is if you think about our IGNITE Strategy, we want to create fuel and we want to reinvest that back in the business. And I feel really good. If you look at our gross margin performance now, we've expanded gross margins for each of the last four quarters.","And at the same time, we've increased advertising levels for each of the last three quarters. So, very consistent with our long-term strategic intent is we're going to drive waste out, and we're going to reinvest that in the brands to drive superior consumer value. And I think you're really seeing that over the last several quarters.","Wendy Nicholson","Got it. Thanks so much.","Operator","Next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","Great. Thanks. First I had two clarifying questions. First is just a follow-up. Wendy, I think had asked about Nutranext. But I believe Kevin you responded to that talking about RenewLife. So, I just want to go back. And even when you acquired Nutranext, I mean to what degree did you have an understanding of the portfolio and that there'd be this decision to cut so much of the business, because some of the brands that were held up, I think they're described as kind of core seems to be what you're deemphasizing. So just sort of almost like a post-mortem on Nutranext would be great. That's the first follow-up. Thanks.","Kevin Jacobsen","Yeah. It was Nutranext. I apologize, Lauren. That was a Nutranext answer. So when we acquired the business -- and this is typical. When we acquire businesses in many cases, it comes along with pieces of the portfolio that we don't have any interest in strategically. In this case, they had done a number of acquisitions. And so they picked up private label. They had some contract manufacturing. They have a number of minor brands in DTC that don't -- we don't see it having long-term value.","And so, pretty typical for the first year or two we will clean that up and get the portfolio focused on what we think has long-term value for our shareholders. And that's certainly what we're doing. So, we're stepping out of the private label. We're stepping out of the contract manufacturing certain aspects of DTC as well and really getting this to the core portfolio that we believe has long-term value.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay, great. And then the second thing was just about the second quarter. We've talked about things will improve. But then you also said the growth will come in the back half. So, I just want to be clear if second quarter sales expected to be down, albeit, a bit better than what we saw in Q1.","Kevin Jacobsen","Yes Lauren, that's correct. I expect second quarter to look fairly similar to the first quarter in terms of sales, but the drivers will be different. The FX environment is getting worse.","Keep in mind the bulk of our FX exposure is in Argentina probably 70% 75%. The big step-down in the peso happened late in August and so you have a partial impact in Q1. You'll get a bigger impact going forward and then that will be offset by improving organic sales.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay. All right, great. And then the other thing I was curious. Sort of post-Analyst Day, I sort of look back and was then thinking back a few years prior to -- I guess it was maybe four years prior to Analyst Day where you'd introduced the concept of fuel versus grow brands. I'm sort of thinking about the degree to which that approach kind of got you to where you are now on some of these big more challenged businesses.","So, I just want to talk about sort of -- there's these steps to improve the short-term challenges, but also maybe a structural change in how you address businesses across the portfolio. Is that sort of a fair thought process? Because it feels like maybe these businesses are to start for like good four, five years and that's sort of how we got here. And also what maybe led to some of the pricing decisions being as I'll call it stubborn as they sort of proved to be?","Benno Dorer","Lauren not really. So, if I think about Glad trash, that's a growth business and Kingsford is a fuel business. So, there's no correlation there as I look at those two businesses. I think it makes perfect sense for us to disproportionately invest in businesses that are faster-growing and that are more profitable. And I feel good about that.","Brita is returning to grow. Burt's Bees has had a strong run. The Food business has had a strong run. And many of those businesses are performing better than they did before we started the concept of fuel versus growth.","I would point to post-pricing issues on those two businesses. We feel good about pricing. We have always said that this is a short-term versus long-term trade-off. It's absolutely necessary for us to offset cost increases through pricing to be able to ensure that we're able to drive long-term shareholder value. We continue to manage our business with an eye on the long-term.","And as difficult as these -- some of these distribution losses and certainly challenges on Glad and Kingsford are, the reality is that we must power through them as part of our focus on long-term profitable growth.","So, I feel good about the fact that we're offsetting pricing aggressively. I feel good about how we're managing the portfolio as a whole and see none of this is related to the choice that we made four years ago.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy","Hey, good afternoon guys.","Benno Dorer","Hey Kevin.","Kevin Grundy","First a housekeeping question for Kevin. So, first quarter, obviously, a bit soft. It sounds like second quarter challenged as well although contemplated in your guidance to some degree.","Kevin I apologize if I missed this. Is it your preference to kind of level set expectations towards the lower end of the 1% to 3% organic sales guidance for the year? Or you still see it's possible to do the higher end which would imply something like 5% organic sales growth for the balance of the year which feels a little bit ambitious?","Kevin Jacobsen","Yes, Kevin. Thanks for the question. What I would say is I am comfortable with our 1% to 3% organic sales. I don't plan to provide any more insight in terms of high-low. I think that's a good solid range for us and feel comfortable with where we're at this point.","Kevin Grundy","Okay. All right. And then a follow-up question on the margin structure in the Household business understanding the significant price investment in advertising and marketing going on there. But the margin in the quarter about 6.5% I call it for operating margin was one of the lowest that we see in that segment in a very long time. This had been a low 20% operating margin business not going back to too far. How do you see the margin structure for that business now going forward? How much of this is, sort of, a permanent impairment, higher cost of business, higher advertising and marketing, trade promotion levels with some of your big important businesses; charcoal, trash bags, litter et cetera? Do you see this as more, sort of, a permanent impairment? Or you think that, kind of, out of the woods after a challenging year this year? Then I'll pass it on. Thank you.","Kevin Jacobsen","Yeah. Thanks Kevin. When I think about it in terms of margin in Household, one thing to keep in mind. The two businesses that are challenged Glad and Charcoal, they're our most capital intensive businesses. And so when you lose volume in those two businesses, you've got a lot of fixed costs that get spread over a lot of fewer units and have an outsized impact on margin. So my expectation is as we get those businesses back on track and growing, you'll see that reflected more positively in the margin line.","Kevin Grundy","Okay. Thank you guys. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Kevin Jacobsen","Thanks, Kevin.","Operator","Next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","Hi, guys. So I have a few questions. But one Benno, I just want to take a step back around the pricing strategy. So look I get the bumpiness commentary. I get we've seen this before commentary. But honestly, I guess, I would have thought that bumpiness is going to be more from the consumer elasticity\u2019s, which has certainly been the case historically. But they're just -- there are many perhaps too many instances of the retailers reacting badly to the price increases. And I guess, I just want to ask a very simple question and I apologize if it's na\u00efve. But why do you think the retailers are kicking you off the shelf now when you're taking the price increases?","Benno Dorer","Yes. So as you -- so consumer elasticity are good, right? So we have commented that they're largely unchanged versus before price increases. We've also commented on the fact that the consumer value measure actually is really positive with 54% of our portfolio being seen as superior, which compares to 53% before price increases. So pricing generally is performing as expected.","Why do -- why are we experiencing these distribution issues? We certainly went out early and confidently. So I would perhaps point to that. Other than that you'd have to ask retailers. But clearly what we're seeing in some categories is that some competitors didn't follow where we might have expected them to follow. And as a result we get an outside reaction.","But look I understand this. In many cases categories where we've lost distribution are softer too. I commented on the correlation between our performance and category performance. And that's really what we're focused on right now. Losing distribution as hard as it was is water under the bridge. We're focused on getting distribution back. And we're working with retailers now to make progress in 2020.","Ali Dibadj","So I guess it's still helpful. But I guess because I just -- I'm sorry. I just don\u2019t -- I don't understand. So if elasticity\u2019s are good, the consumer doesn't respond poorly to this and that's all great. I mean their brands are good. So why are the retailers making -- it sounds like a mistake. What's going on? Is it that they disagree or\u2026?","Benno Dorer","I'm sorry?","Ali Dibadj","Is it that they disagree and that they view elasticity\u2019s as worse? Or they don't think your brands are good enough? Or why do they kick you guys off shelf in many instances now when you're taking prices up, if elasticity\u2019s are good and consumers are okay with it? It helps our costs, so I just don't get it.","Benno Dorer","Let's take Glad as the best example perhaps. We took pricing before, resin flipped. And then there were questions about the cost justification of pricing. To be clear pricing continues to be justified but that doesn't mean that retailers like it. So that part while it isn't something that is up in the category, it's also pretty consistent with what we've seen in the past with the one exception that resin flied after we took pricing. But this is not uncommon Ali. It's worse but in part it is that we took pricing early and perhaps very confidently, whereas, some of our peers did not.","Ali Dibadj","Okay, okay. And then -- so on the confidence going forward, confidence in the second half. Is lapping distribution losses in your second half guidance Kevin? Or is it actual kind of new distribution gains which is in your guidance?","Kevin Jacobsen","Yes. I'd say it's a combination of both. Certainly lapping distribution losses is a big element, when you look at our comps, we'll be lapping in the back half of the year particularly Q4. And then as Benno commented to a certain extent, we're actually working on rebuilding distribution and have some expectation in terms of how that will play out.","But as we said earlier, those decisions are being made right now over the next quarter or so. So we'll have to see how that goes. It's still fairly early but there's certainly an expectation that we make progress there as well.","Ali Dibadj","Okay. And just my last question around Cleaning, you went through it in detail, thank you Benno for doing that. Are laundry shelf space losses or laundry issues -- is that anything in anticipation of the compaction of the product? Or was it just an isolated and different incident?","Benno Dorer","No. I wouldn't call that related to compaction Ali. It's a loss of distribution post pricing as we commented, but nothing related to compaction. No.","Ali Dibadj","Okay, all right. Thanks very much for your help.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we have a question from Steve Strycula with UBS.","Steve Strycula","Hi good afternoon. So Kevin quick question for you on the gross margin, you talked about timing and cadence a little bit saying the first quarter was a little bit better. Can you walk us through some of the puts and takes for the gross margin? Should we expect it down for the next several quarters of the year for the balance of the year? That would be my first question.","Kevin Jacobsen","Sure Steve. As you think about gross margin phasing, as you know for the full year our outlook is it will be down slightly. This was the easiest comp we had. We were down 150 basis points in Q1 last year. So we had a pretty easy comp.","The other item to think about though is on cost savings, we had a very strong quarter. We delivered 180 basis points of benefit to margin. That was the strongest quarter we've had in five years. I am pleased with the performance. But we have a big number we're trying to hit this year and quite a bit of work ahead of us.","So while I'm pleased with Q1, I don't expect to be taking the number up at this point. As I said previously our expectation on cost savings to be close to last year maybe a little bit better. That's 150 basis points, so you kind of phase that through the year. ","Also if you think about pricing the bulk of the pricing we took last year was front-loaded. And so in Q1 with 120 basis points of benefit, I'd expect to see that decline as we move through the year. Same with FX, we have a partial impact this year -- or excuse me this quarter.","So as you get the full impact from Argentina, plus the ongoing devaluation, I'd expect FX impact to be more negative going forward. And then finally, as I mentioned earlier, the supply chain events we're making fairly light in Q1.","We will make those investments over the balance of the year. So you'll see that pick up in the manufacturing line over the course of the year. So when I play all that out, I still think, it's a balanced view about down slightly for the year.","And that would suggest you'll see negative gross margins going forward, with our plus 60 to begin the year.","Steve Strycula","Okay. And then, Benno a quick question. As we lap last year's, weaker flu season. Have you seen retailers start to build back up for the Cleaning and the wipes business, as they think about arguably an easy flu season compare?","And then, can you remind us -- it's been a few years since we've had a compaction cycle. Just to think about, the various -- whether it's volume or margin implications that investors should think about as we move through that period in the spring. Thank you.","Benno Dorer","Thanks, Steve. On the flu season, we're always working with retailers to prepare for flu season, no matter whether flu season is good or bad. So, we will be prepared to serve consumers, as they are looking for more disinfecting products.","And on compaction, typically what you see, if we can repeat what happened in the last few times the way we did compaction is one the gross margin expansion. So we would expect that. I think that's pretty obvious as logistics and packaging material costs are lower predominantly.","And then, what you often see is consumers migrate to larger sizes. And with that usually comes and expansion of consumption which in the previous two times also had a positive top line effect.","So the primary benefit is on gross margin. But it does have a top line effect that can be persistent for the first 12 to 24 months post launch.","Steve Strycula","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Dorer, I would now like to turn the program, back over to you.","Benno Dorer","Yeah. Thank you. And thank you for joining everyone. I wish all of you, a happy Halloween. And we look forward to talking with you again in February, when we report on our Q2.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Managing Director of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference.","Lisah Burhan - The Clorox Co.","Thanks, Stephanie. Welcome, everyone. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, our Chairman and CEO, and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet, and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com.","On today's call, we'll refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including, but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA, and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enable investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations.","Reconciliations with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available on our website as well as in our SEC filings. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release.","Please also recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to the impact of tax legislation.","Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.","With that, let me cover our Q3 performance, discussing highlights in each one of our segments. Kevin will then address our financial results as well as updated outlook for the fiscal year. Finally, Benno will offer his perspective and we'll close with Q&A.","For the total company, Q3 volume and sales each grew 3%. We grew sales in all four segments, offsetting nearly a point of negative impact from Aplicare divestiture. These results were on top of very strong growth in the year-ago quarter when volume increased 7% and sales grew 4%.","Now, I'll turn to our results by segment. In our Cleaning segment, Q3 volume grew 4%, where sales grew 3%. Cleaning segment top line growth was led by Home Care, where volume and sales each grew by high-single digits on top of double-digit volume and sales growth in the year-ago quarter. Volume in Home Care was broad based with record quarterly shipments of several Clorox-branded products, including Clorox disinfecting wipes.","Following implementation of recent price increase, our disinfecting wipes business still reported double-digit volume growth, emphasizing the strength of the Clorox brand. Contributing to the growth were gains from new product innovation, strong merchandising as well as shipments related to a severe cold and flu season. Consistent with these results, Home Care delivered its 15th consecutive quarter of market share gains.","In our Laundry business, volume and sales declined, primarily due to softness in the sodium hypochlorite bleach category. At the same time, as we trade consumers up to higher dollaring items in this category, as well as other bleach-based product in our Home Care business, we're pleased to see continued share gains in Clorox liquid bleach behind our premium Clorox Splash-Less Bleach as well as the launch of new Clorox Performance Bleach with CLOROMAX.","Lastly, within the Cleaning segment, our Professional Products sales declined due to the Aplicare divestiture which occurred in August 2017. Excluding the impact of Aplicare, sales grew double digits from new product innovation, strong e-commerce growth and incremental shipments of cleaning products behind the cold and flu season.","Turning to Household segment, Q3 volume grew 3% and sales grew 1%, with growth in Cat Litter, largely offset by a decline in cold due to poor weather throughout the quarter. Starting with our Cat Litter business, volume and sales grew double digits, driven by core strength in the business as well as our new Clean Paws innovations, which we're now also supporting with a national marketing campaign. This business continued to have strong momentum behind our Fresh Step with Febreze innovation platform and this was our sixth consecutive quarter of market share growth.","In our Glad bags and wraps business, volume and sales grew, primarily driven by strong trash bag volume in the club channel. Consistent with our strategy on this business, we saw all-time record shipments of our premium OdorShield offerings, reflecting our focus on driving profitable growth in this higher margin segment.","In February, we turned on advertising for our new ForceFlex Plus Advanced Protection trash bags, which featured a reinforced bottom, leak guard technology, superior strength and guaranteed seven-day odor control. In our Charcoal business, volume and sales decreased, driven by the coldest and snowiest January through March in the last several years. Simply put, it was the snowiest March in 25 years which is certainly not favorable for Charcoal, especially in early spring. This issue negatively impact the entire Charcoal category, driving consumption down double digits for the quarter.","For perspective, this resulted in nearly 1 point of negative impact to our total company sales in Q3. Since then, we've seen a challenging start to the Charcoal business in Q4, given retailer inventory carryover from Q3, as well as the continuation of poor weather into April. That said, we're focused on executing our plans for our fourth and largest quarter of the year. We're leaning into new partnership with Major League Baseball, turning on our marketing programs for the grilling season and we're working with our retail partners to add additional in-store events notably around key holidays.","Finally turning to RenewLife, volume and sales decreased this quarter due in part to challenges driven by significant orders towards the end of Q2 that depleted our inventories and from a temporary supply challenge resulting from a product pack size conversion. We fully anticipate returning to sales growth in the fourth quarter and we remain excited about the progress we're making in the e-commerce channel as well as bringing innovation to the category, such as our new organics and kits line.","In our Lifestyle segment, volume was flat and sales increased 2%, with gains in Food and Burt's Bees, partially offset by declines on Brita. Burt's Bees delivered volume and sales growth in Q3, largely due to record quarterly shipments of lip care products behind strong consumption and innovation, as well as record quarterly shipments of face care products behind innovation and distribution gains. We're continuing the multi-quarter rollout of our new color cosmetics lines and we're encouraged by the power of Burt's Bees equity and the consumer's desire for natural products in makeup.","Food volume and sales grew driven by all-time record shipments of Hidden Valley salad dressings. Consumption is healthy and the franchise delivered share gains for the 13th consecutive quarter.","To conclude the Lifestyle segment, Brita volume and sales declined following last quarter's double-digit volume and sales growth. The decline was partly due to a merchandising event shift and lapping the launch of Stream Pitcher and Longlast Filter innovations in the year-ago quarter.","Finally, turning to International, volume was up 3%, while sales grew 4%, mainly reflecting the benefits of pricing. We continue to focus on our Go Lean strategy to drive margin improvement in our International business. At the same time, we're selectively investing in portions of our Laundry and Home Care businesses as well as RenewLife and Burt's Bees. These are businesses that are margin accretive, have tailwinds and where we believe we have a strong right to win. We're pleased to see the areas we're investing in growing, such as Burt's Bees which reported double-digit volume and sales growth this quarter.","Now, I'll turn it over to Kevin who will discuss our Q3 financial performance and updated outlook for the fiscal year.","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Thank you, Lisah. We're pleased to deliver another solid quarter of volume and sales growth with sales increases in all four of our segments. As we mentioned in our press release, we've updated our fiscal year outlook for two main reasons. First, our outlook now reflects the impact of the Nutranext acquisition, which closed last month. Second, as we also noted, our outlook now reflects a more favorable fiscal year tax rate. I'll address the details behind our full year outlook and provide additional context on the Nutranext acquisition in a moment.","First, I'll take you through our financial results for the third quarter. Third quarter sales grew 3% consistent with volume growth of 3% and about 1 point of pricing benefit, which was offset by about a point of negative mix. As a reminder, third quarter sales included a reduction of nearly 1 point from the Aplicare divestiture in August 2017.","Gross margin was down as expected and came in at 42.8%, a decrease of 120 basis points versus year ago. This included about 160 basis points of higher commodity costs, as well as 130 basis points of higher logistics costs, which were driven, in large part, by ongoing challenges in the transportation market. Both commodities and logistics reflected the hurricane-related pressures we've previously discussed. Third quarter gross margin also included the benefit of about 140 basis points of cost savings, continuing our longstanding program of driving out waste.","Selling and admin expenses as a percentage of sales were relatively flat at 13.7%. Advertising and sales promotion spending came in at about 10% of sales with spending behind our U.S. retail business at about 11% to continue supporting the long-term health of our brands. Net of all these factors, we delivered diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.37, which included $0.09 of benefit from a lower tax rate of 26% versus 30% in the year-ago quarter.","Turning to cash flow. As we mentioned in our press release, year-to-date net cash provided by continuing operations increased to $574 million versus $483 million in the year-ago period.","Now, I'll go over our fiscal year 2018 outlook. We now expect fiscal year sales to grow about 3% versus our previous assumption of 1% to 3% growth, driven by our expectation for 1 point of benefit from the Nutranext acquisition. Our full year sales outlook continues to include about 3 points of incremental sales from product innovation, partially offset by a reduction of nearly 1 point for the sale of the Aplicare business in August 2017.","We now expect gross margin for the full year to be down 100 to 150 basis points, reflecting the impact from one-time charges related to the Nutranext acquisition, including typical integration costs such as inventory step-up. Our fiscal year gross margin expectations continue to include ongoing cost pressures related to commodities and logistics which we previously communicated. Additionally, we now expect fourth quarter gross margin to be down by 150 to 250 basis points, reflecting the one-time charges related to the Nutranext acquisition.","Turning to selling and admin expenses for the fiscal year, we continue to anticipate selling and admin expenses to come in below 14% of sales. Our outlook also continues to include the benefits of tax reform with an updated assumption of 22% to 23% versus our previous assumption of 23% to 24% for our fiscal year tax rate. Longer term, we continue to anticipate our tax rate to be in the mid-20s range.","Based on our updated fiscal year tax rate, we expect free cash flow for the fiscal year to come in at the higher end of our long-term goal of 11% to 13% of sales. As we discussed in our press release, fiscal year diluted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $6.15 to $6.30 versus $6.17 to $6.37. This update reflects our estimated $0.07 to $0.11 of EPS dilution from the Nutranext acquisition, partially offset by a slightly more favorable tax rate.","As we also mentioned, we strongly believe the Nutranext acquisition brings significant breadth to our dietary supplements offerings building on the May 2016 RenewLife acquisition and expanding our portfolio further into health and wellness. Ongoing, we anticipate Nutranext to represent more than 3% of company sales.","As previously communicated, on a U.S. GAAP basis, we continue to anticipate Nutranext to dilute earnings per share by $0.08 to $0.12 in fiscal year 2019, primarily driven by typical acquisition-related costs. Importantly, we continue to anticipate Nutranext to be accretive to earnings per share in fiscal year 2020.","I'll close by sharing my perspective on the business. First, improving our margins remains a top priority. We're aggressively working to address the significant near-term headwinds from commodity and transportation costs by leaning into our productivity initiatives to drive cost savings and leveraging the pricing power of our brands where justified.","Next, I remain confident in our 2020 strategy and we'll continue investing behind it to keep our value proposition sharp. Importantly, I believe strongly in the capabilities of our team to execute our strategy.","And finally, we'll continue to put tax reform benefits to work with our ongoing focus to support long-term business growth and return excess cash to shareholders. In addition to our 14% dividend increase in February, we'll work with our board of directors to identify appropriate actions, including potential share repurchases, in addition to our usual program of repurchasing shares to offset dilution. As always, we'll continue to be disciplined in our allocation of capital and maintain our debt leverage with our target ratio of 2 to 2.5 times debt to EBITDA.","And, with that, I'll turn it over to Benno.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Thank you, Kevin, and hello, everyone. Let me share with you my three key messages for today's call. First, we had a solid third quarter, delivering top line growth in line with targets and introducing several meaningful innovations to market. We're pleased, we grew third quarter volume and sales 3% on top of strong growth in the year-ago quarter with all segments reporting sales gains in the quarter.","I feel good about these results, particularly given the impacts from the Aplicare sale and from our Charcoal business due to weather, which have continued into Q4. With the Nutranext acquisition which closed on April 2, we've updated our sales growth outlook for the fiscal year to about 3%, in an environment where growth continues to be hard to come by.","A key factor in our achieving this is our continued ability to deliver strong innovation in innovation starved environment. In Q3, we launched or expanded several innovations, including the second wave of our successful Clorox Scentiva platform, which now offers bathroom and toilet cleaning products and a new scent; Fresh Step Clean Paws low track cat litter which while still early is thus far exceeding expectations; Glad ForceFlex Plus Advanced Protection trash bags with leak guard, our best Glad bag ever; and Burt's Bees cosmetics, which launched in Q2 and continued to expand distribution and grow velocities in Q3.","Second, we remain committed to keeping our business fundamentally strong and healthy by taking aggressive, decisive and principled actions to address the headwinds that are affecting Clorox and our industry. Let me highlight three of the actions we're taking. First, we are taking pricing. We're pleased that the increase we took last November on Clorox disinfecting wipes is going well and we delivered double-digit Q3 volume and market share growth even in the face of it.","We also took pricing in our Professional Products business consistently throughout the year, including the most recent one in Q3 and we've now taken pricing on about one-third of this business fiscal year-to-date. In addition, in April, we announced a price increase across nearly our entire Cat Litter business and we now are finalizing plans to take additional pricing more broadly across a significant portion of our company portfolio.","Importantly, we believe we are in a solid position to take pricing. Why? Because we have a unique portfolio of market-leading brands, because we support these brands with strong marketing investments and innovation and the majority of our brands are seen by consumers as providing better value. Because of this, price sensitivities on our brands are even better today than they were three years ago, especially compared with the industry norm. And as I believe we made clear because these price increases are cost justified. But we won't stop there.","We'll also lean into the more profitable parts in our portfolio. As always, we seek to grow our portfolio with margin-accretive innovation, such as with the Q3 new product introductions I just mentioned and also with exciting new items like Burt's Bees liquid lipsticks that started shipping on Monday of this week. And we'll continue our plans to build a more profitable mix in International by selectively investing in our International growth businesses, including portions of Laundry and Home Care as well as Burt's Bees and RenewLife, which in aggregate now account for a quarter of the International portfolio.","And the final action I'll highlight is leaning even further into our strong cost savings programs and other margin improvement initiatives, such as with continued transformation of our supply chain, including with our new Atlanta West facility, which expanded our self-manufactured Home Care capacity and our Go Lean cost reduction and productivity improvement strategy for International, which is starting to produce year-on-year profit improvements on this business consistently.","My third key message is that we remain confident in our 2020 Strategy and our ability to grow margins over time. We remain focused on good growth; growth that is profitable, sustainable and responsible. And in doing so, we'll focus on the right balance between taking aggressive action to address these near-term headwinds without losing sight of what has worked well for us over the long term; investing in a superior value of our brands behind innovation and technology transformation; evolving our portfolio as we have with Nutranext, which expands our business even further into the health and wellness space; and counting on our highly engaged workforce to execute with excellence and consistent with our core values.","As Kevin said, we're pleased to put tax reform to work for our shareholders, while continuing to invest to support our brands and grow our business by investing in our infrastructure and by investing in our people, such as with the new global training program focused on enhancing our culture of inclusion and diversity. So, in summary, we remain focused on a balanced approach of investing for long-term profitable growth, while aggressively and decisively taking action to address near-term headwinds. We continue to have confidence in the competitiveness of our 2020 Strategy as we aim to create shareholder value over the long term.","And, with that, I'll open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Dorer. We will take our first question from Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Please go ahead.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citi Investment Research","Hi. Good afternoon. Could you talk a little bit about the private-label trends you're seeing in some of your bigger categories? Some of your other competitors in the HPC group have talked about more headwinds and I'm curious because you've historically had more exposure there what you're seeing specifically.","And then second thing, can you just address the share repurchase program? I know the comments you just made said that you're willing and open to buy back more shares, but I'm kind of surprised we haven't seen you step up the pace of the repurchase activity yet. Thank you.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. Thank you, Wendy. I'll let Kevin comment on share repurchases and I'll briefly address your private-label question. As everybody recalls, we compete with private label largely in three out of our nine main categories. Our shares are stable. Our business is healthy in these categories. We're not seeing anything that would cause an increased level of concern as it relates to private label relative to what we've commented on in the last few quarters.","We're always mindful of private label, which is why we're investing in our business, which is why we're keeping the value sharp, which is why we have innovation in those categories that we're competing with private label in, and which is why our businesses are generally doing well. So, private label is something that we're always mindful of, but there's no change to a stable status quo.","And, with that, Kevin maybe you can comment on share repurchases.","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Sure. Hi, Wendy. In regard to the share repurchase programs, just as a reminder, we have two authorized programs with our board. One is called our evergreen program, which we use to manage stock option dilution and we've consistently been in the market over the last several years repurchasing shares.","The other program is our open-market program, which we're authorized up to $750 million and we have not leveraged that program to date. What I would tell you is we have a very disciplined allocation of how we apply our cash and we'll continue to pursue that. And so, for us as we think about our priorities, first and foremost we're using our cash to invest back into our business, including targeted M&A and that's very consistent with our recent Nutranext acquisition.","Secondarily, we're going to continue to focus on our dividend. We know that's important to our investor base and we'll continue to look at our dividend payout ratio. And consistent with that priority, as you folks saw, we just recently accelerated our dividend increase from May to February and took an outsized increase of 14%.","Our third priority is, we'll continue to manage our debt. Currently, following the Nutranext acquisition, we're sitting nicely within our range of 2 to 2.5 times debt to EBITDA. And then finally, as we've always said, if we have cash pooling up on the balance sheet and we do not have good uses for it, we'll certainly look for ways to return that to shareholders and certainly open-market share repurchases would be the primary way to do that. And so, I would tell you going forward, as you know, Wendy, Clorox generates a significant amount of cash flow, tax reform has certainly increased the cash flow we generate as a company, and we'll continue to pursue these priorities going forward.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citi Investment Research","Okay. Got it. That's very helpful. But can you just clarify specifically on the Charcoal business, Benno, just vis-\u00e0-vis private label, it sounds like they're just weather headwinds and all those sorts of things. But in terms of your share, all of the incremental promotion you're going to be doing at retailers to stimulate some demand there. Is your share in the way you measure it still competitive and no issues there with private label gaining share in Charcoal?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. No concerns on Charcoal and private label. There's always some variation in share, particularly in the short term and in the periods that is less heavily promoted. What matters to us more is what shares look like in the late spring and the summer. The big news for us on Kingsford this quarter is that the weather, obviously, in Q3 has been very bad for this business and we can influence a lot of things, but weather we cannot. And Q4 certainly in April hasn't started much better.","So, weather and the overall category declined as a result of it is the topic, which has led to a material impact in Q3 and we expect the softness perhaps also to impact Q4. But in terms of overall share, we feel good about this business. We're working with retailers on catch-up merchandising events to make up for some of the lost sales due to the weather earlier this year. We've just launched several innovations, new flavors and natural lighter fluid. We've kicked off partnership with Major League Baseball which we're very excited about, which includes customized baseball packaging. And we have new advertising in the category where we continue to have 100% share of voice.","So, fundamentally this is a good business. It's delivered a lot of value to the company and to shareholders for many years. The basic underlying dynamics as millennials love barbecuing and they love barbecuing with Charcoal because of taste and the experience that Charcoal gives are very favorable. We're dealing with the short-term weather issue, which frankly makes for an easier comp next year, but that's about it. Business is stable and good and we're feeling optimistic about it once we've been through this weather issue.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citi Investment Research","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, thank you for the opportunity. I just want to zoom in more into the pricing commentary. Obviously, we all appreciate a more rational environment for pricing, but I wanted to kind of, if you can \u2013 obviously, when you had the Analyst Day in New York a couple of quarters back you were saying, which is a fair comment that it is tough now to take listing pricing increases.","And obviously we never knew commodities would stay elevated as they are right now and then on top of that transportation. So, on your conversations with retailers, like how are you intending and is it embedded in your guidance for the revised guidance for margins? Is it embedded that you're taking these list price increases? And how much of that is already negotiated into the trade? Thank you.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah, Andrea. So, we can't comment on specific retailer conversations as always. What we have said is that obviously we have taken some price increases already. We have newly announced a few minutes ago that we have started to announce a price increase on Cat Litter. And as I also commented, we will finalize plans shortly to take additional pricing.","Now, you will appreciate that there is lead time and that this will not affect this fiscal year anymore and we'll comment on how it will affect next fiscal year when we give our guidance in August. But there's always a 60 to 90 days lead time on when price increases become effective. And like I said, we're finalizing plans right now.","You took us back to the Analyst Day in October. I would certainly say that what we've commented then on is that we're always looking at pricing when justified. The cost environment has changed very significantly versus last October. And now we're putting the pricing power that we have on our brands to action. We have leading brands. More than 80% of our brands are number one or strong number two. We believe our advantaged portfolio gives us confidence.","Market leaders generally tend to lead pricing and we have many of those market leaders. We remain committed to offering brands that give consumers superior value, but we've always said that the majority of our brands does just that, which is why we're expanding household penetration of the majority of our brands. We're investing in our brands. Our price elasticities have been lower. We have innovation on all of our brands.","So, we feel like the fundamental health of our business, the dynamics of our brands as well as the experience and the track record that we have, having executed many price increases over the last decade successfully, take hold here, in particular in an environment as we're seeing it today where these price increases are principled. They're cost justified and they generally do work for our categories. So, pricing is never easy to execute, but we have experience and are justified. And what we've certainly seen of the recent price increases on disinfecting wipes and on our professionals business and in International. We know how to take pricing and we're just putting that back to work.","What I will say and I've hinted at that is that we're staying committed to value. So, I don't expect these price increases to negatively impact the superior value perceptions that our brands have among consumers because that's the lifeblood of our business and that's how we've been successful over the last few years. So, we're taking all of these price increases that we're announcing today and that we will continue to announce in the next quarter with an eye on staying committed to value for consumers. So, not easy, but the right thing to do and we have a solid case here which is why we're putting it to work.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And just to follow up, Benno, there is no effect now as you had with the wipes, with the trash bags, right? So, net-net you're still going up and you're not seeing opportunities on the value segment at this point, right? The movement is actually up, a net up.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. I mean you've seen disinfecting wipes had another great quarter. That's a business that's been running from strength to strength. It's been growing double digits and that's because we're not just taking pricing. We have a lot of innovation in the market and we're investing in marketing campaigns that resonate with consumers. So, wipes has done exceptionally well in the face of pricing, but we're also seeing the Glad trash bags as a result of the pricing action that we took, which as you'll recall was a price decline end of last year on about 40% of volume.","The business has responded very well. Total Glad business grew volume and sales in Q3. The trash business grew volume high-single digits in Q3. The most strategic business in trash bags, which is our OdorShield business grew double digits. And Glad trash has now returned to share growth in tracked channels which is something that we're pleased to notice.","So, those two pricing actions have gone exactly in line with plans, which is again consistent with a message that we've conveyed to you over many years, which is that we are able to model based on strong analytics what are price increases and in the Glad case, the price decreases due to our business very well and very reliably. And we'll certainly update you and the rest of the community on specifics and how it will impact our fiscal year 2019 in August. But what we've commented on is that we're optimistic that in the midterm we're able to grow profitably, meaning growing sales and margins. And we continue to be optimistic about that very thing.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you very much. This is helpful.","Operator","Our next question will come from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thank you. I wanted to circle back to private label in your categories, Benno. I was hoping you could give us a sense as to how private-label competitors have been responding to your price increases and the pressures they're also facing from higher commodities and manufacturing costs.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah, Bonnie. Again, the only price increase that's been out for a while now is on Clorox disinfecting wipes where we have not seen much pricing from private label where we also didn't count on any pricing from private label. But I think the results on sales, again double-digit growth last quarter speak for themselves.","So, I can't comment yet on how private label will respond to other price increases because we haven't announced any other price increases other than Litter just yet, but that's not been effective in the marketplace. So, I can give you certainly a more detailed outlook and report back when we talk again next quarter. But generally, what we do is we make very specific assumptions based on market dynamics. We don't always count on private label to respond.","Clearly, to your point that you made in your question, the increases that we see are cost increases that retailers see too, that private-label manufacturers see too. Everybody in our industry is affected by them and historically what we've seen is that many times when we took pricing, private label have followed. In some cases, they haven't. But that doesn't negatively impact the materiality of the positive impact that pricing has on our business and the general success of our price increases. So, more to come on Q4.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And if I may just also ask a little bit of a follow-on question on the pricing, I know we're talking a lot about it, but I think it's important. But I'd like to hear more on elasticity or the impact on your volumes, what you might be seeing from what you've put into the marketplace already. And has that elasticity changed in the last year? And then in terms of volume, is it fair to assume that your volumes should accelerate in Q4 given you've really lapped the tough comps now?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. I can't comment on Q4. We don't typically do that. When I think about the rest of your question as it relates to elasticities, again, I can speak to Clorox disinfecting wipes. No change to elasticities, post the price increase. Even though it's early, it takes a while until we have reliable data on that, but again double-digits gains. So, you can see that that business continues to do well because we match up price increases with innovations and with the right investments and we certainly have every intention to continue to do that, too.","I commented on a new price increase on Cat Litter, which comes on the back of a double-digit growth quarter on that business because we are investing behind Clean Paws, which is off to a really fantastic start. So, we know how to take pricing and what we would expect is that price elasticities aren't fundamentally harmed.","What we have commented on last quarter, which I want to re-emphasize, is that our price elasticities over the last three years actually have gone down. And you all know that lower price sensitivity is just better and they've gone down significantly, whereas for the rest of the industry the price elasticities have gone up.","So, we are perhaps somewhat of a unique case in this industry. I know that other companies have perhaps commented that the pricing environment is more challenging. But again, I would point to the strength of our portfolio, but the strength of our investments, the strength of our innovation program, and the facts and the data behind growing household penetration, having brands that offer superior value, lower price elasticities that all make a very solid case that we have pricing power on Clorox brands.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","We'll move next to Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Hello, everyone.","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Hey, Kevin.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Kevin, question for you on cost savings. Clorox Company has done a tremendous job on this front over a long period of time. But clearly in this environment with higher input costs and pricing difficulty come by, it's even more important.","Two questions for you on this front. What are the biggest areas of focus? And then number two, how do you think about the opportunity relative to the 150 basis points per year that you've delivered now over the past several years? How should we think about that contribution now going forward?","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. Thanks for the question, Kevin. What I'd say overall on cost savings is, your first question was where's our focus, our focus consistently has been looking at every area where we spend money and the way I describe Clorox very simplistically is $6 billion in sales. We spend about $5 billion on all aspects of the company and we generate about $1 billion in profit.","We are focused on attacking the entire $5 billion spend. So, I have no one area that I focus on. But we have a program that looks at that entire spend. And every year we're trying to deliver 2% productivity across that spend. And as you mentioned, Kevin, we have a very strong track record of doing that. And I have strong confidence that going forward we'll continue to be able to deliver that type of savings.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","And, Kevin, can you help us just frame the potential magnitude in that front just from a modeling perspective? I mean, as we look at the headwind from freight and commodity costs, pricing will hopefully come through and stick. But can you help us at all frame the potential favorability from upside above and beyond what you've historically delivered given that it's sort of takes on greater urgency?","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Yeah, I would say, Kevin, you guys should be considering that we'll continue to pursue 150 basis points of EBIT margin expansion through cost savings. We've done that historically very consistently and going forward, again I feel very confident we'll continue to be able to do that.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Stephen Robert Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys. Can you hear me?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah.","Stephen Robert Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Sorry. Benno, I guess a big-picture question for me. The sector is broadly under a lot of duress and there are a lot of factors at play, but it really seems to me that we're seeing just a shift in the historic balance of power within the CPG value chain away from incumbent big branded CPG companies and towards new niche players, towards retail inclusive of Amazon and private-label brands, and ultimately towards the consumer resulting in this perceived lack of CPG pricing power and perceived risks for long-term market share and margins.","So, I guess the question is, what's your perspective on that? Do you agree that such a shift is happening? And if so, why is Clorox in a more sustainable position than others? You're clearly outperforming on the top line, but can you afford to maintain both market share and margins over the longer term against what \u2013 I think it feels to many like a structurally more difficult backdrop going forward? Thanks.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Steve. Certainly not an easy environments for all the reasons that you said. We remain confident that we will be able to grow and grow profitably, meaning sales and margin going forward. And we have a lot of things that perhaps aren't very common these days. We have increased our brand investments over time. We are leading our industry when it comes to engaging consumers online. We have innovation in an environment where little innovation exists. And we have built a relatively wide moat around our businesses through innovation, through technology, through manufacturing capabilities.","So, we do feel like our business fundamentally is healthy and I think our top line results show that. We're dealing with heavy headwinds, which hopefully will be temporary and which everybody sees, and that's what we're addressing. But we do feel like we're in a relatively unique position because our brands are strong. And if I look at our fundamentals, they're really healthy.","You mentioned customers. Last quarter we grew volume with 15 out of our 20 top U.S. customers, which includes the very largest customers. So, while philosophically I can appreciate how retailers are in a position of power, how retailers certainly like the profitability of private labels. At the end of the day, consumers are the ones who decide whether companies are successful or not. And we are serving consumers extremely well and better than we ever have, I might add, which is why fundamentally our business is healthy.","We have a short-term margin issue. We're addressing that margin issue aggressively mostly through pricing. And that's why we remain confident in our ability to not just grow profitably, but also on the back of a really strong balance sheet continue to add a lot of value to shareholders. So, it's a dynamic environment. But this environment will have winners and losers. But we at Clorox look at this as a time to lead and as an opportunity. And today we're winners and we have every right to be confident that it will continue to be like that.","Stephen Robert Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much. I'll leave it there. Welcome to the call, Kevin.","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thanks. My first question is around gross margin. First, for the quarter, that 70 basis point benefit from other, is that primarily revenue mix? And then on the outlook, how much would the outlook have changed on gross margin, excluding Nutranext or said another way, is the $0.07 to $0.11 dilution for the deal, is that all coming in COGS because that's a really wide range on the gross margin given we have only one quarter left in the year? Thanks.","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Olivia, for the question. On the 70 basis points, I'd say that's a combination of revenue mix as you described. It includes our divestiture of the Aplicare business which certainly improved margins.","And then on your other question as it relates to margin, the change in our outlook is solely driven by the addition of Nutranext to our outlook. And so, as we said previously in February, we'd be down modestly and we described that as less than 1 point. That's still my expectation for the base business as we look forward. But we are now adding in Nutranext to the business.","And if you're familiar with the acquisition accounting, we will now have to revalue all the inventory we've acquired to fair market value, which means as we sell through that inventory we'll generate very little margin or profit on that business. And so, I expect that to play out certainly for the fourth quarter and then likely early into fiscal year 2019 as well before we sell through all the acquired inventory.","And maybe last comment in regard to the range, what I'd say there is this is obviously new business. We've owned it less than 30 days. And so, we're still working through trying to understand the implications of that business. I think this was an appropriate outlook for the new acquisition. But we'll see how that plays out in the next few months.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Understood. And then just broadly, would love to understand the rationale for the Nutranext deal. You guys have obviously been very clear in your interest in expanding in areas like wellness. It's obviously growth accretive, but it's a very fragmented category with no clear leader. So, I'm wondering, what do you guys think that you guys have that will either, A, give you a platform to consolidate share; B, be able to launch some of \u2013 or potentially bring in some of your existing products into new channels or vice versa bringing that business into channels where you have greater relationships.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Olivia. As you know, we like fragmented categories with no clear leader. We feel like this meets all the criteria of a solid acquisition that we've frankly been emphasizing for years. It's bolt-on in nature. It's U.S. centric. It's in the health and wellness space which, of course, we know well and have expanded into more specifically as it relates to vitamins, minerals and supplements well with RenewLife. It's a really solid fit with our capabilities and it's profitable and growing.","So, those are the criteria that we talked about for many years and this one checks off all the boxes. So, we're excited about the prospects. This is a fast-growing business, a profitable business, gives us scale and breadth in vitamins, minerals and supplements. And importantly, we have several number one brands in differentiated niches, and we love that. We've built our company on the back of precisely such brands. And what Nutranext does is bring really strong capabilities, for instance, in direct to consumers to Clorox.","About a third of this business is in direct to consumer and we love that. But this business will benefit from our capabilities, for instance, in marketing, R&D, sales and product supply. So, near term, right now what we're focused on is bringing the two companies and organizations together and are off to a really nice start.","And then, we'll go ahead and expand distribution and brick and mortar and e-commerce. We'll plug in our marketing capability. We love that we're in differentiated segments here, emerging segments, not single letter vitamins, but product benefits that are scientifically grounded and that start to have a really strong following among consumers.","We'll create a strong innovation program. We'll choicefully take these brands international and see a lot of opportunities there. And importantly, we'll realize cost synergies as we plug in our operational machines. So, this has all the components of an acquisition that we like. For anyone who's listened to what kind of acquisition we like, this meets all criteria and we're very optimistic about this.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right. Thanks, Benno. Thanks, Kevin.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Wanted to tackle a few more things. One is back on pricing, totally get the commentary that you've made, but very simply, are you taking pricing in line with inflation? Because it looks domestically always your pricing might have been down, including trade spend and everything else. So, want to pressure test a little bit that topic.","And then, the second one is around reinvestment. Clearly, marketing spend look like it was down a couple of hundred \u2013 or 100 basis points this quarter. Can you talk a little bit about the plan there? Why that was a good idea for the quarter, and the plan there going forward?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. Ali, I'll take reinvestments, and then I'll let Kevin answer your question on pricing. So, as you think about advertising spending, so we have committed and said that about 10% of sales is the right level. We've also said that there's going to be variability by quarter based on timing of initiatives. Q3 was 9.8% of sales. So, that's exactly in line with about 10% long-term guidance.","And at the end of the day, look, the proof is in the pudding. We grew 3% in volume and sales on top of 7% volume and 4% year ago despite the headwind in Charcoal and despite a 1-point hit on Aplicare. So, to me this is a non-issue. We remain committed to the 10% and we have no interest in cutting, in particular, because we have and we'll continue to have a very strong innovation program.","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Yeah, Ali. And in regard to pricing, as you look at our pricing, we anticipate about 1 point of benefit to both the quarter and the year. Historically, that's been primarily driven by our International segment. I'd say though this year's a bit different with some of the pricing actions that Benno previously talked about. A portion of that is being driven by the U.S. And then as it relates to trade spending, we've actually pulled back a bit on trade spending and so we've taken pricing in the U.S. and reduced our trade spending.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And so just a follow-up on that and a different question on M&A, just a follow-up on pricing. I guess, I stay with the question, are you able to take pricing in line with cost inflation?","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","So, Ali, the way we think about it is, we certainly price what we describe as the long-term inflation rate. So, we won't look at a change in any one quarter, but we price to the long-term view we have of commodities, and so that's certainly the approach we take and we've taken historically.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And then the separate question is just in terms of M&A and I want to pause on that for a moment and try to understand the track record and where you think your skill set is in terms of M&A. You can go back to things like Aplicare, you can go back to \u2013 which you're divesting now clearly. Burt's Bees took a little while obviously to ramp up. RenewLife sounds like a short-term hiccup, would love more color there, but there is a hiccup going on there now. Can you talk a little bit just about your core competencies that you may have developed over the past little while in terms of acquisition capabilities or any places you think you can improve?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","I mean, we feel good about our ability to do M&A. We started as a bleach company and we built our company based on M&A over 105 years. So, I feel good about that. I would clearly call Burt's Bees a successful acquisition for our company. We've divested Aplicare, but you can't win them all. RenewLife has been a real success with a one-time hiccup that will return to normal and back on track in Q4. And now we're going into Nutranext and feel like this is a great fit with our company.","So, feel good about our ability to do M&A, feel good about the ability to create value, and feel like we have a solid track record. I don't think any company has a track record of 100%. If that company exists, I would like to know which it is. But I look forward and feel very confident about Nutranext. We've invested a lot in M&A capability and our approach over the last three years, it's nothing I want to comment on publicly, but feel very confident about our capabilities in the area and very bullish about Nutranext.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much, guys.","Operator","Next question will come from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good afternoon. Thank you. Or it's good morning your time, sorry. A couple things, first of all, ACV on Burt's Bees cosmetics that were launched in Q2 both where we are today and versus target? And how would we or even you looking back a year from now, what would be a success for the size and rollout of that business?","And then just secondly, how big did an outsized flu season play? Is there any way of quantifying that within Cleaning? I know it was huge in the scanner data. I want to know how that lines up with shipments maybe some of the unmeasured volumes. Thank you.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Jonathan. I'll take cold and flu first while it's fresh. Clearly, this was a relatively strong cold and flu season, but actually it wasn't as strong as it was presented in some of the commentary that I've read. Cold and flu incidents was up 6% to 8% versus a year ago. The cold and flu season was below the levels of, for sure of fiscal year 2013 and 2015. So, it was higher, but not severe.","And as a result, we've seen some impact perhaps on our wipes business, but not material and that's because that particular business as is our business, in general, is less and less dependent on cold and flu because what really drives consumption is the planning that we do with our customers year-on-year to merchandise this business very aggressively during the winter season. And we have very strong merchandising plans and consumption, regardless of the season, which is why I wouldn't look at cold and flu as a material driver behind our Q3 results in that segment.","On Burt's Bees, perhaps more broadly and to put it in perspective, strong quarter again with volume and sales growth in the high-single digits. Feel good about lip care and the consumption. A little tidbit, it's early and before we get overly excited, but the last four weeks was the first time that our lip balm actually reached the number one market share position in tracked channels ever.","So, that tells you that we're very focused on continuing to keep the core business very healthy and it is. But also our innovation in face care and in cosmetics continues to do well and has contributed. We don't typically comment on ACV levels on innovations, but it's still building. And that's driven by retailer shelf resets and marketing timing. And I would say that on cosmetics Q2 was the start. Q3 was a significant ramp-up in distribution, but we're not done yet and we're also not done yet in investing in the proposition.","Cosmetics continues to expand velocities and we're pleased with where we are. And we have just this week launched a new line of liquid lipsticks which continues the strong stream of meaningful innovations getting into a more cosmetics and lip color type of field.","Liquid lipsticks for perspective, those of you who have less experience or like me with \u2013 as consumers with the category, it's a form of lipstick, but has the finish of a lip-gloss. So, it's somewhere in between two categories and it's very on trend. It's a growing category and we launched this as part of the strategic effort to give consumers beautiful and on trend products that are 100% natural. So, we'll continue to have a very solid stream on Burt's Bees, both on the base as well as in our cosmetics.","Not in a position to give specific sales targets for our initiatives. We generally don't do that. But as you can see from our efforts over the last year, we view cosmetics as a very interesting, strategic field for the brand to play based on what consumers tell us. And we have a number of initiatives that we feel good about already in the markets that will continue and we're pretty optimistic not just about optimistic, but Burt's Bees as a whole.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Shannon Coyne with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Shannon Coyne - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just really quickly back on the pricing, I'm just wondering if you guys \u2013 are you seeing the same or different dynamic in pricing online versus brick and mortar. Also, I'm wondering if there are regional differences. So, are you finding it harder, or are retailers pushing back and raising prices in the Southeast, for example, where all the (01:00:48) are opening up a large number of stores there?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. So, for us we have one \u2013 we have a pricing policy that we call fair and equitable, so there's no difference between online and brick and mortar. And as far as regional differences are concerned, again, can't comment on specific discussions that we have with retailers, national or regional.","And again, keep in mind that there's just one new price increase out there. And what we've commented is that we will finalize plans to certainly take additional price increases over the next few months. Those will take time. In many cases, the discussions, of course, because we haven't finalized plans yet, have not taken place. So, it's a little bit premature, yeah.","But what I will say is that again taking pricing is never easy. Taking pricing always has bumps in the road near term. Taking pricing always as consumers adjust to new higher price levels leads to somewhat lower volumes temporarily for about 12 months or so until consumers have gotten used to the new price points. But we have a strong track record of taking pricing. And we know how to execute it successfully and I expect that track record to continue.","Shannon Coyne - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Sorry, I was on mute. Wanted to just ask about inventory de-stocking. I mean obviously nothing apparent in your results this quarter in terms of volume growth, but I was curious what you are seeing in terms of inventory levels at retail of any of the de-stocking that you'd mentioned last quarter and then I think some other peer companies have still discussed, it's something you're still seeing or not really?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Lauren. As you mentioned, we had inventory adjustments late in Q2 in a few of our categories and we commented on that in our last quarterly call. We also then commented on the fact that we're off to a really strong start in January leading us to believe that some of it came back.","We also commented that we didn't see a material impact on the year then. And there's really no news to that. So, certainly in Q3 we don't feel like there was a significant impact from inventories. We also continue to believe that this is not going to impact the fiscal year in any material way. We also think that it always evens out in the long run. So, we don't think that we're sitting on high inventories that are at risk going forward. So, inventories this last quarter was a non-factor.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. And then just one follow-up I still had on Nutranext. So, my understanding anyway of the probiotics is, there's a lot of medical research, all of it. There's a lot of work going on in the probiotics space, in my sense, is it probably maybe a bit of a difference in terms of the clinical studies and things that have gone on in that space versus some of the areas where Nutranext plays? So, if you could just talk a little bit about, I guess, the credentials, the medical backing and so on of this new business that you're acquiring is one.","And then, two, just a bigger question on cyclicality in the VMS category, I feel like it's a business where it was on trend for several years and then there's some journal article that tells people it doesn't work or whatever it is and then there's a falloff and then it comes back. So, is there any concern that you're introducing a level of cyclicality to your business that really doesn't exist otherwise? Thanks.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Lauren. So, before we become interested in the category, we start with the attractiveness of the category itself and that includes, in this case, the scientific backing. It also includes the sustainability of a category. And we feel like we've done our homework on this.","If I mention two of the major brands that we bought, one is around anti-stress and sleep and that has a lot to do with magnesium levels. If you Google that and if you do a research, there's a lot of scientific research out there. One of their brands, NeoCell is a leader in collagens. Again, a lot of research out there.","And if you think about perhaps the third bigger brand, which is in food-based vitamins, that is a trend within multivitamins that people like, they're less synthetic, more food-based multivitamins that also contain super foods and other nutrients. And that, of course, is a more general trend not just in vitamins, minerals and supplements.","So, we do think that these are based on solid science. We have a good advisory council of scientists that we use to assess the attractiveness and the scientific soundness of the categories that we're in. And we've always commented as a company, we build brands for decades and not just for the short term. And we feel like the businesses that we bought and the categories that we will now be in certainly fall into that category line.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks very much.","Lisah Burhan - The Clorox Co.","We'll take one more question.","Operator","Our last question will come from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Thank you for squeezing me in. I appreciate that. I wanted to come back to the pricing question real quick and I apologize if you already gave this, Benno. But can you give us some color in terms of how the Cat Litter price increase has been received so far? And the broader price moves that you're planning right now was the decision to move forward those at all educated with some preliminary conversations with retailers. And if so, how did those preliminary conversations go?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. Jason, appreciate the question. Cannot comment on specific conversations that we have with retailers. As you will appreciate, the Litter conversation is still pretty new. As I've commented, we began to announce this last month. So, by no means are we through those conversations.","And then as we think about what we do to consider pricing, we always look at the competitive set. We look at the retailer dynamics. We look at the strength of our business. We look at price sensitivities. So, there's multiple factors that go into the decision on taking pricing. But I would perhaps just point back at my comments from earlier that we know how to take pricing because we've taken pricing many times before, including this fiscal year, and we always get through it.","We live in categories where consumers do not buy more if pricing is lower. So, we understand and over the years it's been proven that taking pricing when justified as is the case here, it's a key driver to add value to categories for retailers, too. Most of our categories as you think about volume have grown modestly, but in terms of value have grown significantly over the years. And a big part of that is trade up through pricing and through innovation. That's how our categories work. That's what we've built our company on and that's why we're investing in innovation, in marketing and solid value. But that's also why we keep taking pricing when justified.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","No doubt.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","And today's environment is no different than the environment was, for instance, 10 years ago when the economy went south when it was really hard to take pricing, but we did. So, I look at this as a very solid case that's very well considered and that we'll execute with excellence.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you for that. And one follow-up just on productivity within the gross margin line, clearly looking at margin bridges you guys continue to deliver. But you're leaking all of it and then some out through logistics and manufacturing line there. I appreciate there's some logistical cost inflation system right now, but just looking back over the last five years in netting cost saves just first logistics manufacturings netted you to zero, if not a modest deficit. So, as we think about cost saves and that net logistics manufacturing line, so effectively a net cost save line, is there a glide path to getting that, the aggregate to flip positive? If so, what are the drivers? And what could the cadence look like?","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. Jason, this is Kevin. What I would say is if you look over long periods of time and as we've said, we are committed to growing EBIT margins 25 to 50 basis points. If you look back over the last nine years, I think we've grown EBIT 35 basis points on average per year. That clearly won't be the case in any given quarter and given year. But over long periods of time, I feel very comfortable with our ability to keep growing margins.","As we look forward, we're clearly in an inflationary cycle right now and then obviously you're hearing us talk quite a bit about pricing, because we need to price to recover the cost increases we're incurring. So, as I look forward, I have to set an expectation that we're still committed to growing margins. We feel confident that we can do that because we do have pricing power and we will execute that pricing power to offset the cost increases we're incurring.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Dorer, I would like to turn the program back over to you.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call. Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for the Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference.","Lisah Burhan","Thanks, Sharon. Welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, our Chairman and CEO; and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet, and a replay of the call will be available for seven days on our website thecloroxcompany.com.","On today's call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA, organic sales growth and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enable investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations.","Reconciliations with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available on our website as well as in our SEC filings. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release. Please also recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcome could differ materially from management's expectations and plans.","I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.","With that I'll start by covering our top line commentary, discussing highlights in each of our segments. Kevin will then address our financial results as well as outlook for the fiscal year 2020. Finally, Benno will offer his perspective, and we'll close with Q&A.","For the total company, Q2 sales decreased 2%. These results are on top of solid sales growth in the year ago period. Organic sales were flat. I'll now go through our results by segment. In our Cleaning segment, Q2 sales were flat for the quarter as gains in Professional Products and Home Care were offset by a decline in laundry.","In Home Care, sales were up behind strong volume growth across a number of product lines, including Clorox disinfecting wipes, Clorox toilet bowl cleaners, and Clorox Scentiva, particularly in non-tracked channels.","Our Scentiva innovation platform continues to show robust growth, even three years after its initial launch. We remain focused on driving superior consumer value through innovations, like our Scentiva Wet Mopping Cloth, which are doing well and continue to build distribution. A new scent across the platform, Tahitian Grapefruit, will start shipping this month.","Additionally, we were pleased to deliver record second quarter shipment growth of Clorox disinfecting wipes. However, our shares in this category continue to be down as a result of higher competitive merchandising activities, and we expect these activities to continue in the back half of the fiscal year. We're increasing our investments to support the long-term health of our brand.","We're doing this in two ways. First, we're strengthening our merchandising plans with higher trade investments. And second, we're increasing our marketing investments behind Clorox compostable cleaning wipes, which have had a positive early reception from both retailers and consumers.","Laundry sales were down for the quarter, driven primarily by distribution launches among retailers -- select retailers, which continued from last quarter. We expect improvement going forward as we start rolling out a full line of compacted bleach products this month. Our plans this fiscal year also include a new laundry sanitizing innovation platform, which started shipping towards the end of 2019. We're supporting this innovation through strong marketing investments to drive awareness and trial.","Lastly, within the cleaning segment, Professional Products continued this momentum and delivered another quarter of robust sales growth, with broad-based growth across all channels and product line supported by innovation.","Turning to the Household segment, Q2 sales were down 8% with declines in all businesses. In Bags and Wraps, Q2 sales were down due to ongoing distribution losses and select portions of the portfolio and increased competitive activity. While we continue to make progress and have seen sequential improvement in both volumes and sales, we've seen a further increase in competitive activity, consistent with what we've seen in past periods when there was a pullback in resin price, even on a temporary basis.","We expect these competitive price reductions and higher promotional activities to continue in the back half for fiscal year. With a keen focus on consumer value, we're further increasing our investments in Glad and coupling that with a number of innovations to drive long-term profitable growth for our brand and the category. ","As expected, grilling sales were down double digits this quarter. While consumption was strong, it was more than offset by lower shipments and we finished working through high retail inventory from a weak 2019 grilling season and efforts that started in Q1. We expect to return to normal retail inventory levels as we enter the new grilling season.","As a reminder, Q2 is a relatively small quarter for this business representing about 10% of annual shipments. Going forward, we remain focused on executing our strategy in three areas. One, enhancing the consumer experience; two, implementing the right trade and pricing structure; and three, investing in innovation including our core charcoal products and alternative fuels such as pellets.","As noted in our press release, we've changed the name of this strategic business unit from Charcoal to Grilling, to reflect our broadest strategic view of the category. In RenewLife, which represents about 1% of total company sales, sales declined by double-digits due to the continued category and competitive headwinds. However, we're encouraged by the early signs of progress we are seeing with two of our three biggest customers now showing growth. As a reminder, a full brand re-launch will occur in the first half of FY 21.","Finally, our Cat Litter business was down slightly due to higher trade spending and lapping strong double-digit sales growth in the year ago quarter which benefited from price increases. The Fresh Step Clean Paws innovation platform, which saw a double-digit increase in shipment this quarter, continues to show promise and we\u2019re behind this momentum in the back half.","In our Lifestyle segment, sales grew 4%, reflecting volume growth across all businesses. Burt's Bees delivered a record quarter of sales, driven by continued strength in its core categories of Lip Care and Face Care. In Lip Care, Burt's Bees achieved a market leadership status in 2019 as the number one overall lip balm in the United States for the first time ever over a 52-week period.","Burt's Bees lip balm has grown shares for 20 consecutive quarters for five years in a row. This success was fueled by a strong pipeline of innovation such as the watermelon enhanced flavors. In Face Care, Masks, the restaged sensitive skin care line and pore cleansers all had double-digit consumption growth. Food sales were up again this quarter supported by higher merchandising level, driving strong shipments of Hidden Valley Ranch products.","On the innovation side, our Ready-to-Eat Dips platform is expanding to include French onion, Fiesta Ranch, and deluxe cheese and Ranch dips. And while a new Hidden Valley Ranch Secret Sauce line, which was launched in January, is continuing to help unlock new Hidden Valley Ranch eating occasions. Hidden Valley Ranch extended its streak of share growth to 20 quarters.","Brita sales were up strongly behind higher shipments of our premium filtering bottles and Long Last filters and water filtration systems. New products, including large capacity plastic and stainless steel bottles, are expected to enhance the filtering water bottle innovation platform even further building on consistent volume growth in Brita that now dates back more than a year.","Finally, sales for Nutranext were down slightly this quarter, reflecting double-digit decrease in our non-strategic brands, partially offset by solid growth in our strategic brands. We are encouraged by the success of our strategic brands, which was fueled by higher demand creation investments, and we\u2019re increasing those investments further to driver additional awareness and trial in these emerging and fast-growing categories. The decrease in non-strategic part of this portfolio was driven mainly by our decision to continue rationalizing the lower margin part of this business that came as part of the acquisition.","Lastly, turning to International. Sales were down 2% for the quarter, reflecting 8 points of foreign currency headwinds, mainly from Argentina, partially offset by the benefits of price increases. Organic sales in the segment grew 6% consistent with our IGNITE Strategy that aims to improve profitability in international. We're continuing to invest selectively in profitable markets and growth platforms to keep yielding returns on businesses like Burt's Bees, Cat Litter, and the Clorox equity.","Now, let me turn it over to Kevin who will discuss our Q2 financial performance and our updated outlook for FY \u201820.","Kevin Jacobsen","Thank you, Lisah, and thank you everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased with the progress you've made in Q2 as we delivered sequential improvement and organic sales, our fifth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion and another quarter of strong cash flow. I'm also encouraged by our continued progress in Bags and Wraps and Grilling business units and expect to see continued sequential improvement on these businesses in the back half of the fiscal year. As you saw in our press release, I've updated our outlook which I'll discuss in a moment.","Turning to our second quarter results, sales decreased 2%, reflecting 2 points of unfavorable foreign currency headwinds. On an organic sales basis, second quarter sales were flat. Gross margin for the quarter increased 40 basis points to 44.1% compared to 43.7% for the year ago quarter. Second quarter gross margin included the benefit of a 150 basis points from cost savings and a 100 basis points from pricing. These factors were partially offset by 90 basis points of higher trade spending and 80 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs. Second quarter gross margin also reflected ongoing cost durability and commodities partially offset by the impact from foreign currency headwinds.","Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sale came in slightly higher at 14.5% compared to 14.3% in year ago quarter due to reduced operating leverage. Year-over-year selling administrative spending for the quarter was relatively flat. Advertising and sales motion investment levels of a percentage of sale came in at about 10% of sales are about equal to year ago quarter with spending in our U.S retail business coming in at 11% of sales. Our second quarter effective tax rate was 21% compared to about 19% in year ago quarter. Net of all these factors we delivered diluted net earnings per share of a $46 versus a $40 in a year ago quarter and increase a 4%.","Turning to year to date cash flow. Net cash flow provided by operations for the last six months of the fiscal year came in at 498 million versus 449 million a year ago period, an increase of 11%. The year over year increase was primarily due to lower working capital, partially offset by the timing of payments.","Now we'll turn to our fiscal year 2020 outlook. As we mentioned in our press release, we've confirmed our fiscal year sales outlook of down low single digits, dropped 1%. We are now projecting lower devaluations of the Argentina peso, which we expect to be offset by increased competitive activity and the bags and wraps and wipes categories, partially driven by resin cost deflation.","Our fiscal year organic sales outlook now assumes a range of about flat to 2% growth. Embedded in organic sales assumption is a more cautious near-term view of our back half sales expectations for bags and wraps, reflecting increased competitive activity. Importantly, we continue to expect our grilling business to return to growth in the second half of the fiscal year. As a reminder, we've previously assumed devaluation of the Argentine peso at about 50% and now our expectation is closer to 40% devaluation over the course of the fiscal year.","Turning to gross margin, we now expect fiscal year gross margin to be up slightly, reflecting our expectations for ongoing cost favorability and commodities and a slightly lower impact from foreign currencies. These factors are expected to be partially offset by a lower price and benefit in the back half as we have now last majority of our fiscal year '19 pricing actions. Our fiscal year gross margin also reflects higher trade promotion spending to address increased competitive activity and select categories.","In addition, our fiscal year gross margin outlook continues to anticipate additional supplies investments to support long-term value creation, including a rollout of Clorox liquid bleach compaction beginning this quarter. We now expect fiscal year advertising and sales promotion investment levels to be slightly above 10% of sales, reflecting increased investments and support of robust innovation pipeline in the back half of the fiscal year.","We also continue to expect selling and administrative expenses to come in about 14% of sales. We now expect fiscal year EBIT margin to be about flat. Our outlook continued to anticipate our fiscal year tax rate to be in a range of 22% to 23%. Net of all these factors, we now expect fiscal year 2020 diluted EPS to be in the range of 610 to 625 which ranges the lowering of our range by $0.05.","Before I turn it over to Benno, I'd like to reinforce that I'm pleased with the progress we continue to make on our business. We delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion with strong contributions from our cost savings program. We also delivered another quarter of strong cash flow. Importantly, we remain on track to return to organic sales growth in the back half of the fiscal year.","Looking ahead, I continue to believe Clorox to taking to results that are more in line with our long term financial goals, as to continue to focus on executing our IGNITE strategy to drive long term shareholder value.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Benno.","Benno Dorer","Hello, everyone, and thank you Kevin. Here are my three key messages for the second quarter. First, while our top line performance is not yet where it needs to be, I'm pleased with the progress we're making on our business which is evident in our Q2 results. As I look at the results of our overall portfolio in the quarter, I do feel good about the growth we saw in a number of Clorox branded products in our homecare business, even as I fully expect stronger growth in wipes category in the future.","I'm also pleased about the broad-based strength in our Professional Products business. In Lifestyle, Burt's Bees continued its strong top line momentum with record quarterly sales, and we saw sustained strength in our food business, behind increased merchandising support, and also in water filtration behind innovation. And once again, our team in International continues to deliver very good results in currency neutral terms behind strong execution of our pricing initiatives.","I'm also pleased to have delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion supported by our strong cost savings program. Importantly, we are continuing our focus on improving our bags and wraps and grilling businesses. On our grilling business, we're pleased to see solid consumption growth and we feel good about retailer reception to our go-to-market plans for the 2020 grilling season. Now that we're finished working through retail inventory from the year ago season, we continue to expect this business to grow in the second half.","Now, as Kevin mentioned, we've taken a somewhat more cautious near-term view about bags and wraps business, given our expectations for continued increase competitive activity. Moving forward on that, we are focused on driving superior consumer value. We'll do this with a consistent stream of unique innovations, leveraging our superior capabilities and technology and consumer insights backed by category-leading advertising investments.","We believe these focus areas will allow us to sustain a competitive advantage and help engage retailers leading to strong in-store position. As I look at the other parts of our portfolio, generally, I feel good about our backup plans, which effects our expectation for improved sales behind strong innovation and marketing plans as well as progress on the distribution front. This brings me to my next message, which is that, we have strong consumer and retail plans for the second half of the fiscal year, fueled by increased investments that reflect confidence in our innovation program.","Bringing value to our consumers and retailers is the key to returning to growth. Our second half plans emphasize this and we're executing with a strong sense of urgency, yet also the right way. Our relentless focus on strengthening the value proposition of our brands through meaningful innovation continues with a strong pipeline of new products in the back half, including the compaction of Clorox liquid bleach as well as the introduction of Clorox compostable cleaning wipes, Clorox fabric sanitizers, Kingsford grilling pallets and several innovations in Bags and Wraps, Food and Natural Personal Care.","As you saw on a press release, we're leaning harder into supporting awareness and trial behind these new products, with plans to increase year-over-year advertising spending in the second half of the fiscal year. And of course, we'll continue to invest behind the momentum and significant upside opportunity in ongoing innovation platforms such as Clorox Scentiva, Fresh Step Clean Paws, Brita filtering water bottles, and Hidden Valley Ready-to-Eat Dips.","As I mentioned last quarter, we expect that our retailer engagement and the strength of our innovation programs will contribute to better back half results. I'm very encouraged by the strong retail receptions to our innovation so far, which is part of why we're stepping up our advertising investments. And finally, I'm pleased about our progress to improve distribution trends moving forward. We will provide another update in Q3 once results are in market, but assume feel good about the constructive conversations with retailers overall, putting us in a position to earn meaningful net distribution gains across our portfolio in 2020.","And for my last message, I'd like to reinforce that I have the confidence that our IGNITE strategy will guide us in our ongoing pursuit of delivering long-term shareholder value. The focus of IGNITE is to innovate across the entire Clorox value chain to earn people's enduring loyalty to our leading brands. We are innovating how we build brands and on are track to begin implementing purpose on all major U.S. brands by the end of this fiscal year, which should significantly boost marketing ROI over time.","We are innovating shopping experiences and making good progress, engaging customers in strategies to grow their businesses through new and frictionless experiences that can help eliminate shopping barriers in our categories. We are innovating how we work by continuing to invest in digitizing our supply chain to drive productivity and we remain focused on achieving our new higher annual cost savings target of about 175 basis points.","And finally, we are driving our ESG commitments to create value for all our stakeholders. As we invest in major sustainability driven product innovations in the second half, we also are accelerating our goal of achieving 100% renewable electricity in the U.S. and Canada through 2021, full years ahead of our original goal. We continue to view ESG as fundamental to long term value creation and I'm pleased with our progress to integrate ESG even further in our business strategy.","Operator, you may now open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.","Steve Powers","Great, thanks. Hey, guys. Maybe first, Kevin, just a quick cleanup and clarification on Argentina. Are you getting incremental pricing in that market? And I just asked because I think your October outlook presumed you would not. I just wanted to understand what the current state was.","Kevin Jacobsen","Yes. Hi, Steve. Good morning. Yes, we are getting pricing better from Argentina. Maybe just a little more background there. As you saw, we've updated our expectations for devaluation. We assumed 50%. We've seen the currency hold up pretty well in our second quarter, and so we revised that to 40%. But additionally, we get out pretty early with pricing in Argentina. So, we took a number of price increases in the first quarter. They are certainly benefiting the overall profitability you may have seen in our International segment.","Steve Powers","Okay, perfect. And then a second clarification, I think despite the competitive challenges, the flat organic result this quarter came in a little better than you telegraphed in October. Was there a particular driver there, and in the context of the full year coming down, that implied second half reversal. Is that just bags, Wraps, and Grilling staying weaker than planned for a bit longer, requiring more work or other areas showing less resilience versus what you hoped? Or is it -- I think it's the former, but I just wanted to -- want to clarify that?","Kevin Jacobsen","Sure. So, on the first part of the question, yes. It did come in a little bit better than we anticipated. And there's really two areas. The first was FX, while it's still about a 2 point drag, that's a little bit better than we anticipated in the quarter, and then the other area was our Lifestyle segment that was really strong performance, and the performance is really broad-based. We saw every business within that segment perform quite well and exceed our expectations.","And then as we look out over the full year, what I\u2019d say the two areas that we've highlighted is, we are seeing increased competitive activity in two categories; our wipes category and our bags and wraps category. So, because of that, we will increase trade spending to defend share in those categories, and specifically, maybe the bags and wraps I'd tell you, not surprising. We've seen this before. When we see the type of resin deflation, we typically see manufacturers invest more when that occurs. And so, we're going to have to spend some money to defend there.","And then, Steve, on your question on Grilling, we continue to feel very good about grilling. It's on track with our expectations for the full year. We fully expect to return that business to growth, and so that business is very much on track.","Steve Powers","Okay. And if I could, maybe for Benno, in addition to the promotional investment, you're also as you discussed stepping up the A&P investments, my guess is that that's targeted different businesses than the promotional spend. So, can you confirm that? And then I guess what's really motivating the uptick? Is it just that you have more funds given the -- given the FX environment? So you -- you feel like you have the flexibility to spend or is there something you've seen that's giving you more confidence in the ROI now versus three months ago? Thanks.","Benno Dorer","Steve, the step up in investments really reflects our confidence in our plans. That's the sole motivation. It certainly does include a strong retailer reception to our innovations. Also in a few cases, strong initial consumption results out of the gate on some of the innovations that we launched in January, which includes compostable wipes.","So, you know, we are leaning into this innovation to lean into the momentum that we all see, and of course, three months ago, six months ago, we would have said that we're taking a more realistic view of our spending given that we're still cycling through distribution losses, and now of course in the back half we are lapping those distribution losses. We expect, given the productive discussions that we have with retailers, solid results on the distribution front.","So, it's really driven by the confidence that we have in our plans. The spending will go into innovations that we launched in the back half, but also innovations from previous years and I mentioned some like Clorox Scentiva, which is still showing robust growth, Clean Paws and Fresh Step, which grew double-digits last quarter, Brita Filtering Bottles, which is showing nice continued progress, ready-to-eat dips on Hidden Valley which we're supporting with more innovation going to back half.","We feel really strongly and encouraged about all the back half plans, and we're not afraid to invest behind it. A question that maybe could come up in the context of it that is maybe worthy of addressing upfront is do we expect the change in our mid-term outlook on how much we will spend in advertising and sales promotion, the answer to that is no. This is really an increase that is really related to the back half of this fiscal year. We certainly commented in the past that we think that an average level of about 10% of sales per fiscal year is the right level, and we continue to believe that.","Operator","Next question comes from Steve Strycula with UBS.","Steve Strycula","So, Benno, just a very straightforward question. Wanted to understand, the back-half sales is a relatively wide range and just wanted to understand based off your retail conversations would seem like they went well, what takes us to the low end versus the high end, whether it's the distribution clarity or maybe the consumer pull through and responsiveness to some of the innovation? Thank you.","Benno Dorer","Yes, it's a combination, Steve. Certainly what we -- first of all, I have to say there's six months left in the -- in the fiscal year. But several things can make up for the range. First of all, competitive activity, right, we cannot predict that and we have commented that certainly in two categories, we're seeing the promotional and merchandising environment increase as those categories tend to be more sensitive in spending toward the -- in particular resin environments, which, as you know, is a little more favorable at this point, so cannot fully predict competitive activity, but that can have a major impact distribution outcomes.","So we know quite a bit, of course on what distribution outcomes are, but we don't know everything. We also know from the information that we have about decisions that retailers may have taken as it relates to our brands, but not competitive brands. That's still ahead of us. And then of course coronavirus, cold and flu, you know that hasn't been a factor in Q2 and so far, we're not seeing an uptick but it's a rapidly evolving situation.","So we're certainly watching that and we're getting ready to be able to supply our customers and also our healthcare institutional customers with products, should they need that to help consumers combat the virus. So these are three pretty important swing items that could lead us to the lower or higher end.","But all in all, we feel like the midpoint of the range would point to a 3% sales growth in the back half on average, which of course is very much in line with our ongoing algorithm and because we are investing in items that don't just have a short-term impact but drive our brand equities and have a long term impact, we feel like those investments also set us up nicely for a solid fiscal year '21.","Operator","Next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan.","Andrea Teixeira","Hi, thank you. So I understand you have [indiscernible]","Lisah Burhan","Andrea, you breaking up quite a bit. Hey, operator maybe we move onto the next question and try to have Andrea call back.","Operator","Your next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi.","Wendy Nicholson","Hi, good afternoon. A couple of quick ones. First thing, Kevin, maybe just to clarify the trade spending in the quarter, I think you said it was 90 basis points of gross margin pressure but if my memory is right, I think it was 180 basis points in the first quarter. So is that just a timing issue? I would have expected higher spending this quarter as you try to regain distribution etc., etc. and see more gross margin pressure from that, but curious if there's any commentary on that.","Kevin Jacobsen","Yes. Hi, Wendy, good afternoon. You're right on your memory, it was 90 basis points this quarter, it was a 180 basis point hit the margin last quarter. The biggest change from the first quarter is less investment in charcoal as we cycle through the bulk of the season, as I think, Lisa mentioned in her prepared remarks. Q2 is a very small quarter for us.","So we have less investment in the category due to -- and as we also said what we're really working on the trade spending is working through higher retail inventories as we had a poor season year '19 and we want to make sure we're set up for a strong season year '20. And so we've been investing in trade in that business in both Q1 and to a lesser extent Q2 and we feel like we're in a good position as we head into season year '20 that we've got retail inventories right and we're ready for a much stronger season.","Wendy Nicholson","Got it, got it. That makes sense. On the bleach compaction that I think you said were shipping this month. What's your expectation for competition? Do you think they follow the same degree of compaction? Do you think there's going to be incremental promotion? How much of a price increase are you embedding? Maybe if you could just talk a little bit more about that, that would be great.","Benno Dorer","Yes, Wendy. So compaction is starting this month as you rightly said, and will take until the end of the fiscal year. There is no pricing, it's a straight conversion. Typically with -- with initiation of retailers, we see a whole category move. So of course we have yet to see that because that's really well outside our control.","But if this compaction wave mirrors previous compaction waves then what we're typically seeing is the whole category to move because this really is an initiative that's certainly good for all the manufacturers, it's good for retailers, it's good for the category. It's also good for the planet.","So it's a win, win, win and there really isn't a reason for the category not to move. Consumers of course are getting a more convenient product and again there is no performance trade-off for consumers either. So we are optimistic that this will be an initiative that will see the whole category move and we'll provide an update, after Q3.","Wendy Nicholson","Got it. Fair enough. And then my very last question is just on trash bags. In the Nielsen data that we saw today and I know Nielsen doesn't tell the whole story or even -- even close to the whole story. But still, you commented on a higher level of competitive activity in the bags category. On the trash side in particular, it looks like private label is the one who is actually doing more of the promotions but their market shares aren't increasing. So I wondered if you could just comment kind of on your read where the promotion is coming from. What do you see in the broader universe and whether you're more worried about the branded side of the competitive dynamic or the private label side? Thanks.","Benno Dorer","Yes, really varies by category, Wendy. On the Glad side, we see what you see that if I take us back a few months ago, what we said is that we are spending in trades to address price gaps that really works. We saw price gaps moves down and we saw significant increase in momentum on our business. What we've seen more recently in a more benign resin environments is that, in particular from private label, we are seeing more activity and we see price gaps increase again. Now we also see what I think you hinted on and that is, that that's really not working for the category.","The category trends are softer. We've always commented that people are not buying more trash bags, if they're cheaper and that's pretty much how it's playing out. And what that really does is give us optimism that in the long run, rational behavior will prevail and that we're going to see a continued balance in the category that will allow premium brands to grow behind innovation and delivering value that consumer see as superior and that's certainly our focus in this category.","Operator","Next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan.","Andrea Teixeira","Thank you for taking me back. Sorry for before. So I was hoping to go back to the cadence of the second half for organic. So I understand what you said in terms of -- in the past of regaining distribution in trash to one -- I believe one large customer. Is that something that we should be looking more into the fourth quarter building with what you mentioned to Wendy? And then on the gross margin, just a clarification in terms of the gross margin bridge, is that -- Kevin was talking about is our commodity is actually getting better like for the second half for, I understand you're going to lap some of these -- of these improvement by the fourth quarter. So I just want to know if embedded on that, you're actually having a better outlook for commodities than before. Thank you.","Kevin Jacobsen","Sure. Hi, Andrea. It's Kevin, I can take both your questions. On organic progression, what you should assume is we continue to demonstrate sequential improvement as we move through the year. And so, as you recall, in Q1, organic was down about 2%. It was flat in our most recent quarter and if you take a midpoint of our organic sales outlook, it would suggest 3 points of organic sales growth in the back half of the year and I would expect to continue to see sequential improvement as we move through the back half of the year.","Much of the distribution benefits will have a bigger impact in Q4 than they will in Q3. And so that's our expected progress. And then maybe just also, as we think about our organic sales goal for the year, the 0% to 2%, I would just offer -- I'm much less concerned about the average for the year and much more focused on the momentum we're creating as we head into fiscal year '21. So I feel very good about the progress we're making and where I believe we'll end up in the fourth quarter as we head into '21.","And then our gross margins on -- in terms of the commodity environment, what I'd tell you is, if I set resin aside, commodities are pretty much playing out as we expected, which is slightly inflationary, generally in line with broader inflation in the economy and that's pretty consistent with what we expected. What we are seeing is, while we expected resin to be deflationary, we certainly saw a bigger movement in the second quarter than we anticipated. I still think it will be down in the back half of the year, but to a lesser degree. Typically what we see is that manufacturers go down for planned maintenance in the spring and that usually puts a little upward pressure. Now, I think what we have to balance out right now is with what's going on with the coronavirus and it's certainly reducing overall global productivity. We'll have to see what that does to global demand for resin but for right now, my expectation is that it continues to be favorable, but not to the same degree we saw in the front half.","Operator","Next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","Great, thanks. I just wanted to go back to distribution. Because, Benno I think the specific language you used was that, we're -- we positioned ourselves well to earn back distribution. So I just wanted to get a sense for how much visibility you do have at this point for both things building in kind of the traditional reset timeline of this quarter and then even going into Q4?","Benno Dorer","Yes. So, obviously wording carefully chosen because as always, and as all manufacturers, we have to earn distribution from retailers, right, because they have to believe that our products are value added, said that, two things are going on. First of all, as you remember, there are a number of distribution losses post pricing that we're now lapping in the back half. So that should play in our favor. And then, realize that you'd all like a very detailed updates but the reality is not all decisions are made by retailers requiring us to be respectful here.","There are of course also competitive implications because this is all sensitive and, like I said earlier, we know quite a bit of our distribution results for the back half, but not all. This will play out with implementation in Q3 and Q4. But clearly I think as you also saw us talk about the conversations that we have, we feel good about them being constructive and productive. We have a lot of innovation.","Innovation, generally is effective driving distribution and our sales outlook for the back half wouldn't be doable without generally a more favorable environment on distribution. So I think this is probably the appropriate way for us to characterize where we are. There'll be a further update in Q3, but the fact that we are investing more in our brands is based on confidence as we've all said earlier and certainly how we feel about the conversations that we have with retailers, an indication that we may get, should they materialize the way we think they might, we feel positive about what we'll see in that environment and then more update in Q3.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay, great, thanks. And then just continuing to another question on the bags and wraps category. So, one thing that's changed very recently is now your competitor, right, is public. So we've got a lot more visibility into dynamics in that category. And I think many of us sort of understood in the past. So one of the things that was interesting to me in that process was seeing the innovation with, in particular with ultra strong rates sort of a bag, that's a real competitor to ForceFlex and that it's actually been on -- it's been capacity constrained there.","So it just -- looking forward, is your thinking about competitive dynamics thinking about your branded competitor thinking about innovation there, thinking about that they were capacity constrained while you were losing distribution. Just anything more you can offer on this build back rate. Is there a lot of innovation in your plan? Is there adjustments in your pricing structure that kind of helps you regain leadership positions as a total in that business? Thanks.","Benno Dorer","Yes, Lauren, of course, we are following that closely, even though I will tell you that many of the things that you quoted were news to us. I certainly don't want to speculate about what might happen, but there are two things, perhaps are most important here. The first one is that generally publicly traded companies care about the top line and also margin growth and what that does is drive productive and rational behaviors.","So we just leave it there. And, second, we remain confident in our right to win in these categories, which really isn't affected by them going public. First of all, we have commented on a superior innovation capability that we continue to have with the joint venture that we maintain with Procter & Gamble. I'd just point to the more than 100 patents and patent applications that we have over the last five years, and that compares to less than 10 for the said company.","And then as we think about our brand building efforts, the fact that we continue to be a leading investor in the consumer in this category, along with our commitment in superior consumer value, that's been a robust right to win for sure a decade and a half now since we've had the joint venture. And the proof will be in our continued innovation and without getting into details.","All I can say is that we have a lot of confidence in not just our back half innovation on this business and as you know, there is quite a bit, but in the long term innovation as we manage innovation with minimum three-year timeframe, we know obviously about the innovation that we have are coming on to the business and we're pretty happy with the innovation platform that we have on Glad and we're pretty confident that we can get this business back on track once we've cycled through the well-documented issues, which we continue to characterize as short-term.","Operator","Next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America.","Olivia Tong","Great, thanks. Want to talk a little bit on your commentary around competition spends and why you think that about 10% is still the right number, because if competition is spending more and you feel good about your line up, why wouldn't you look to invest more heavily over a longer term period or is it just that you prefer to keep that flexibility in between trading support between promotion and advertising? Thanks.","Benno Dorer","Yes, Olivia we've always commented that we're not afraid to spend more, should there be an opportunity, and right now, certainly, there is an opportunity. And spending, of course is also broadly defined, right, whether that's in advertising, sales promotion or capital spending in initiatives that deliver growth. So we will always prioritize the long term health of our brands. We will always manage this business for the long term versus for the quarter. So all those things that -- I know you're used to from Clorox, they remain true, said that, you know, we think that the overall spending level in advertising and sales promotion isn't going up.","So as a general rule of thumb, we like the 10%. Part of why we're taking it up in the back half is that in the front half, we spend less than 10% because we have waited for our back half innovations to come on and certainly the fact that our margin situation is slightly more positive. It gives us a little bit of room to do so. But 10% continues to be the right number, we'll always take a look at that, but that's been the right number for a while and we don't see any reason why we should move off of that.","Olivia Tong","Got it. And then just on gross margin. Raw materials, obviously, we can see, has been a nice driver. But has there been any change in your expectations in other areas particularly either cost saves or manufacturing logistics? Last quarter you mentioned a delay in the litter plant. Any other changes in terms of the timing of project that might be helping this year, but the expenses will eventually come and the investments are just further down the line?","Kevin Jacobsen","Hi, Olivia. Yes, I would say, no real changes in timing or expectations for the year. As we mentioned, we have two large cost savings projects, bleach compaction, our new litter facility, those projects both continue to progress. As you know, obviously compaction, we're starting this quarter, litter we're probably 18 to 24 months out before we bring a new plant online, but those both continue on track.","Operator","Next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC.","Nik Modi","Yes, good afternoon, everyone. Benno, can you just talk about what's going on in Laundry in terms of some of the distribution losses? I mean, is there a plan here? Can we build distribution or is it just cutting space overall of the aisle? And then on the compaction, how should we think about the margin implications of that as you guys kind of get the full scale of the distribution of that product?","Benno Dorer","Yes. Thanks, Nik. Laundry was down for the quarter, certainly in volume and share and it's not our aspiration for the business and certainly not happy with that. The reason is mostly post pricing distribution losses sound like a broken record, perhaps, but that's, of course, been a known issue on several of the categories and something that we're cycling through. Said that, I'll also give the perspective that our past 13 weeks share through November is about 61% and that's well within the long term range and just to name three examples, it's higher than it was two years ago, or three years ago or four years ago. So maybe that's helpful for perspective.","Feeling good about back half plans, obviously on the distribution side, cannot say what will happen to the category. We have seen a little bit of a contraction in overall space that retailers dedicate to this category, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. And generally leading brands and importantly leading SKUs are benefiting from that because there is greater shelf clarity.","So we haven't seen a reduction in overall shelf space for the category leads to a reduction in sales or a reduction in market share.","It would be our expectation that among compaction, perhaps or after compaction perhaps distribution is about neutral versus what it is today, because all we're trying to do is convert the category. We're not using that as an opportunity to build distribution. We're really leveling the playing field with compaction. Margin impact on compaction, obviously is positive. What we've commented on in the past, is that the last time we compacted, it was a 500 basis point margin improvement to the business. We'd expect this one to be somewhat lower, but still meaningful to the business. So feeling good about compaction and feeling that this initiative is on track.","Also want to point in Laundry to fabric sanitizers which we're launching now and is off to a good start and that will be one of the initiatives that we're investing in quite significantly because it's a growing category that's become quite sizable and it's one, given the nature of the category, sanitization where we feel like the Clorox name has a strong equity with consumers and customers, for that matter, and we feel like our products can add meaningful value to that category and its momentum. So feel -- feel good about the back half in Laundry and expect better results, certainly not happy with the share losses and also the volume losses in Q2.","Operator","Next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","Hi guys. I have a few. I would like first to just go back to Lauren's question. We've seen Glad volatility based on commodities for a while. It just -- it feels like the market share shifts have been a little bit more severe this time, particularly -- I am tying bags and wraps specifically, sorry, particularly given the fact that you changed your portfolio on bags and wraps and gotten out of the kind of lower-end stuff for the past few years. And so I struggle with Reynolds hasn't changed the dynamic of the industry, that margin dynamic for you that much, particularly because you guys will remember but I think a lot of people don't remember this when PakTech was public, it's not like things were easier. In fact, it sounds like they are harder than they were in the past few years. So I just want to go back to that question and really get a sense of whether you really think there is no impact or is even better that a big competitor is now public and and I'd say that in the context of a category that just doesn't grow, so to grow your top line, you basically have to go to some market share.","Benno Dorer","Yes, on profit. So all I'd say is that I don't want to speculate at this point and what -- all I did say is that for a publicly traded company buying growth and buying market share, it doesn't necessarily work, because the margins and profit growth matters, too. So we'll see how it all plays out. You and I have followed this category for a long time obviously, I don't remember it being easier or more difficult when PakTech was public.","The reality is this is a very competitive category, there is no question. And we have lost some market share but if I unpack that a little bit, the market shares are mostly because of post pricing distribution losses. So it's our own doing and what I've commented on in the past is that we have taken into account a very conscious trade-off between short term and long term.","If you then look at where the distribution losses occur though and also the share losses occur, they are mainly in the less profitable base trash segment, as you know and also in food storage. As you know, we're very focused on trash. If I look at the indoor premium trash bag, which is the heart of our business and also the largest sub segment in trash and as you can imagine, one of the more profitable parts of the business, that part actually grew in Q2.","So there is puts and takes on Glad, clearly we're taking a more cautious approach. Clearly, we are in a mode of defending this business and not everything is rosy while we're seeing green shoots. But what I'd say is that we have confidence in our right to win in this category. The right to win in this category does not change and we're investing behind it which expresses our confidence going forward.","Ali Dibadj","No, helpful context. I do want to go back to -- you mentioned long term and short term and just ended on investments. You guys over the -- over a while have looked at things like charcoal strategically and Brita strategically and other than I'm sure you're not going to name strategically, I'm sure Glad is in there as well. I guess if you take a step back. Why do you own Glad strategically?","Benno Dorer","First of all, I can't confirm that we've looked at certain businesses that you've mentioned.","Ali Dibadj","Understood. I get it.","Benno Dorer","So, that would be speculation on your end. And I hope you can tolerate me saying that. Why do we own Glad? Why do we own Glad strategically is, first of all, it's very aligned with our capabilities, first of all. Second, over the long term it's added an enormous amount of shareholder value. So obviously we want each of the businesses that we own to add shareholder value in the long term.","That does mean that every now and then there is a business that struggles in the short term. And you know whether that was Brita a year or two ago, which is now one of our strongest performing businesses or litter and charcoal certainly falls into that camp right now as well. That does happen in a highly diversified portfolio. So while we always look at whether and how we can be the highest value owner of our business, we like this business, we're confident in our plans forward and it's a very solid fit with our capabilities on multiple fronts.","Ali Dibadj","Okay,. And then last question maybe for Kevin on the gross margin drivers. If you look at kind of a net price, so price change and then subtract out the trade spend that you mentioned in the footnote went negative 60, negative 10 and really if you go back it was positive-positive in '19 then negative 60, negative 10 for Q1, Q2. Well, maybe it was on, I think, Wendy's question earlier but like, what should we expect the gross margin impact of net pricing to be as we go forward?","Kevin Jacobsen","Definitely, there is a pretty big inflection point that will start in Q3 as I'm sure you'll recall most of the pricing we took last year was front-loaded. And so it's driven very nice benefits to margin. You'll see a pretty material change starting in Q3. So if you think about the front half of this year, pricing generate about 110 benefit to gross margin. I expect in the back half of the year, you'll see that closer to 20, 25 benefit as we now cycle through it.","And so what I expect to see going forward is a smaller benefit from pricing, a little bit of International still to go, and then you'll have the impact of trade spending as we've talked about some increased competitive activity that we'll address with increased trade spending and so trade spending will outpace the benefit from pricing as we think about the back half of the year.","Ali Dibadj","Got it. So it's like a negative 90 basis point we saw from higher trade promotion spend in that footnote number four will be even higher than 90 as the price changes will be closer to 20 to 25?","Kevin Jacobsen","Yes, I think in terms of the net benefit just because you will see less benefit from pricing, you'll see ongoing trade investment.","Operator","Next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse.","Kaumil Gajrawala","Thank you, everybody. Benno, you mentioned that you're now happy with inventory levels. Can you give a little more context on the impact that decreasing inventory levels had on your top line over the past couple of quarters?","Kevin Jacobsen","Yes, Kaumil. Hey, this is Kevin, I can address that one. And I would say we feel very good about the progress we're making on inventory. In fact, if you -- if you saw in our prepared remarks, we had very nice growth in cash provided by operations over the first six months was up 11%. That's primarily driven by some really good work we're doing on improvements in working capital and specifically, inventory. And I would highlight a number of areas. The first is on our Nutranext acquisition. We've owned that business a little less than two years.","And I think we continue to get better understanding the demand signal and managing inventory to meet demand, so we've got more efficient on that business over time. The other two I'd point to is on Brita. If you recall, we've moved our supply chain. We're just finishing up moving our supply chain out of China to the Dominican Republic. We started to do that work because of the tariffs that were imposed. But we've built up some additional safety stock inventory to manage that transition, which we're mostly through now.","And beyond doing the safety stock system, we also now have moved production much closer to the market and to allow us to keep less inventory going forward. And then the last item I'd point to is, we've done some nice work in our Glad business. You know, as we recapitalize that client based on our new technology, if you recall, ForceFlex came off patent, a while back. We've introduced our new patent protected technology and we've invested manufacturing assets behind that technology and we brought some more in line recently that's allowed us to reduce overall inventory levels on Glad and has been very nice benefit that should continue.","And so good work to date. What I'd also tell you though is, as we look forward and Benno made this comment earlier, we do understand the coronavirus is something we're thoughtful about, we'll see how that plays out with retailers, but we are taking up inventory levels to be prepared for the potential increase in demand for some of our bleach products. And so that's something you'll see in the back half of the year.","Kaumil Gajrawala","Okay, got it. And then you also mentioned in your -- in the press release on cleaning some unfavorable mix effect from channel shift. Can you just talk a little bit about what you're talking about there. Is this product specific? Is it margin specific? What exactly is the difference there?","Benno Dorer","Yes. Pretty simple, Kaumil. Thanks for allowing us to clarify. So there is some non-tracked channels where the net sales for volume sold is lower, right? So think about Klub, typically where products are sold at a discount, that shows up as a drag at the sales or at least in the volume to sales ratio and that's happened in cleaning, where we see certain parts of our portfolio in part of the non-tracked channel perform particularly well.","Operator","Next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","Excellent. Thank you guys for squeezing me in and I appreciate it. Two questions from me. First, a pretty simple one on compaction. You start shipping this quarter, should we expect a nice pipeline fill given the shelf holding capacity should accommodate many more bottles with the smaller size?","Benno Dorer","Not really. I don't think it's going to be very material, Jason.","Jason English","Okay, like I said, that was a quick and easy one. Now stepping back, you've mentioned a few times the -- the broad-based distribution losses that you've suffered in the wake of the price increases. I step back and I rewind the clock to the time where you were taking these prices and you were very pleased then and you were very confident then like you are now in the strength of the relationships with the retailers and I think I remember you saying the talk the talk, the conversations are strong, the message is one of support for you. Yes in the wake, we've seen a lot of negative ramifications for those actions. So what changed? Where -- what did you sort of misjudge in that, that caused that derailment? And since all that's happened, what steps have you taken to kind of go the other way in mending those relationships and strengthen them to the point where you now have this resonating confidence in your ability to recover the distribution and drive the sharp inflection in the back half?","Benno Dorer","Yes, if I rewind and what really happened was that, first of all, right after we took pricing, our consumption was very strong, as you will remember. That was prior to distribution losses but what we said then is that we expect significant bumpiness and a significant bumpiness would show up, for example in distribution losses and in merchandising losses. So that's exactly what happens and as a result, I don't really see any change. So you don't find me any more or less confident on this than I was six months ago or 18 months ago.","The reality is that we are playing a long game here. We are protecting our ability to grow margins in the face of cost adversity with an eye on the long term and retailers understand that, but retailers certainly also didn't consistently like that as we had anticipated. Where the case is perhaps like on Glad that where it was more pronounced than we had anticipated, I would absolutely say that that's true in parts, because as we've duly noted, like so many institutions and companies, we didn't necessarily get the resin forecast right, right?","So if I look back, I would have liked to get more accuracy into our resin forecast because maybe our plan forward then would have been different and maybe distribution losses, if I speculate for a second, would have been more benign. But by and large, this is playing out exactly as we anticipated then. We've always said that we're after good growth and good growth is profitable and sustainable and responsible and we don't like the distribution and the share losses either, at the same time, we do like our margin enhancements, which allows us to invest in the momentum of our brands in the back half and that's what we're focused on.","Operator","And we have a question from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Kevin Grundy","Hey. Hello, everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in, two quick ones for me because we've covered a lot of ground. Benno, I just want to make sure I'm clear on the messaging with respect to the adequacy of the investment levels in your guidance for this year. So it sounds like the additional investment behind price and trade investment in advertising and marketing will position the Company well to get back to its normal type of algorithm back half of this year and into next year. So both top line and from an earnings perspective as best we know sort of steady state commodities, if you could confirm that. I'm just trying to handicap the risk that this is a multiyear necessity for higher investment levels, so maybe you could just comment on that. And then quickly on M&A, given some of the challenges in some of your bigger businesses, are you any less inclined near term on the M&A front, given the potential distraction and integration risk. Thank you.","Benno Dorer","Yes, I'll take M&A and then Kevin is going to take your good question on advertising sales force levels. Not anymore or less inclined to do M&A, than we always are. As we always comment, we look at many things throughout the year, certainly continue to find desired valuations to be on the higher side and we'll continue to be disciplined. What we have said in the past is that our priority is to have a healthy core. So our focus right now is on just that and we like the progress. Said that, for a good acquisition that is on strategy and where we feel like we can add clear value to a business, we remain open, so that there is no change to what we've talked about during our Investor Day in October.","Kevin Jacobsen","And Kevin, on your question about investment levels, I will make a couple of comments. First is, I'm sure you can appreciate, I won't provide any outlook for fiscal year '21. We'll come back and do that at a later date. But what I would say is, as Benno mentioned, we do believe 10% about is the right investment level, sometimes a little bit more, sometimes a little bit less, but feel like that's the right level of investment long term.","And we are working to get back to our IGNITE financial goals that we set back in October, if you recall, 2% to 4% top line growth. We believe, we're taking the right actions to get back to those levels in the back half of the year and that certainly what we care about is that momentum going into fiscal year '21, that we get back to growing the top-line. And since they are the long-term goals, we're expanding margins, and we feel pretty good about our ability to do that.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Dorer, I would now like to turn the program over to you.","Benno Dorer","Yes. Thank you all and all that's left is to say is that I look forward to talking with you again in May when we discuss our Q3 results. Thank you and have a good day everyone.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"5214":["The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) Q2 2018 Earnings Conference Call February  2, 2018  1:30 PM ET","Executives","Lisah Burhan - Managing Director, Investor Relations","Benno Dorer - Chairman and CEO","Steve Robb - Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Steve Powers - Deutsche Bank","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Andrea Teixeira - JPMorgan","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Joe Altobello - Raymond James","Ali Dibadj - Bernstein","Jason Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Shirley Serrao - Barclays","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge","Operator","Please standby. Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to The Clorox Company Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Managing Director of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference.","Lisah Burhan","Thanks, Evan. Welcome, everyone and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, Clorox\u2019 Chairman and CEO; and Steve Robb, our Chief Financial Officer. We\u2019re broadcasting this call over the Internet and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com.","Let me remind you that on today\u2019s call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including but not limited to free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations.","Reconciliations with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today\u2019s press release, this webcast\u2019s prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the financial results of our website, as well as in our filings with SEC. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today\u2019s earnings release.","Please recognize that today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management\u2019s expectations and plans. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to the impact of tax legislation.","Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management\u2019s expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.","With that, I\u2019ll cover our Q2 business performance, discussing highlights in each of our segments. Steve will then address our financial results, as well as updated financial outlook for the year. Finally, Benno will close with his perspective followed by Q&A.","For the total company, Q2 volume and sales each grew 1%, reflecting nearly a point of negative impact from the sale of Aplicare in August 2017. This is on top of very strong growth in the year ago quarter when volume increased 8% and sales grew 5%.","In addition, sales were reduced by about 1 point from the combined impact of retailer inventory adjustment and lower shipments due to transportation carrier capacity constraints, both of which happened late in the quarter. Importantly, though, we saw tracked channel consumptions tracking well ahead of shipments late in the quarter and we do not expect a meaningful impact in the year from these events.","I will now return to results by segment. In our Cleaning segment, Q2 volume grew 2% where sales grew 1%. We\u2019re pleased with these results, recognizing that for the segment, it includes about 2 points of negative impact from the sale of Aplicare and that we are lapping double-digit volume growth in the year ago quarter.","Cleaning segment topline was led by Home Care, where volume and sales each grew by mid single-digit on top of double-digit volume growth and high-single digits sales growth in the year ago quarter.","Growth in Home Care, which is our largest business unit, continues to reflect broad-based strength across The Clorox equity portfolio. This reflects yet another quarterly record for shipments of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes behind double-digit growth in the club channel, as well as from shipments of new Clorox Scentiva products. Consistent with these results, Home Care delivered its 14th consecutive quarter of market share gains.","In our Laundry business, volume grew modestly on flat sales, following Q1 when retailers stock up for hurricane-related purchases. Recognizing this, we\u2019re pleased to see continued share gains in Clorox Liquid Bleach behind growth in our premium Clorox Splash-less Bleach, as well as the launch of new Clorox Performance Bleach with Cloromax.","Lastly within the Cleaning segment, our Professional Products volume and sales declined driven by the sale of Aplicare. However, the balance of our Professional Products business continues to perform strongly.","Turning to Household, Q2 volume was flat and sales decreased 3%, compared with a 12% sales increase in the year ago quarter, with gains in RenewLife more than offset by declines in other businesses.","Starting with our Glad Bags and Wraps business, volume and sales declined mainly due to lower volume in the club channel, partially offset by continued strong growth in e-commerce. At the same time, we saw all-time record shipments of our premium OdorShield offerings, reflecting our focus on driving profitable growth in this higher margin segment.","On the innovation front, we just started shipping new ForceFlex Plus advanced protection trash bag, our best trash bags yet, which features a reinforced bottom, leak guard technology, superior strength and guaranteed seven-day odor control.","In our Charcoal business, volume and sales declined, following a double-digit increase in the year ago quarter. Now as a reminder, Q2 is a relatively small quarter for this business, representing less than 10% of the annual shipment.","As we head toward growing season in the second half of this fiscal year, we\u2019re launching a new partnership with Major League Baseball, as well as new advertising. As a result, we continue to feel good about our plans for this business.","Cat Litter volume and sales declined, driven partly by lower merchandising in the pet channel and a late in the quarter retailer inventory adjustment. We view these two factors as transitory and do not anticipate them to have meaningful impact on our plan for the full year.","The business continues to have strong momentum behind our Fresh Step with Febreze innovation, resulting in a fifth consecutive quarter of market share growth. We\u2019re building on this momentum by launching Fresh Step Clean Paws Low Tracking Litter to address the biggest unmet consumer need in this category behind an exciting new and advanced technology.","Finally, turning to RenewLife, volume and sales each grew by double digits and we\u2019re especially excited about the strong progress we\u2019ve made in the e-commerce channel, which is now a significant portion of this business.","In our Lifestyle segment, volume and sales each increased 3%. Our Brita business volume and sales each grew by double digits, driven by strong club merchandising, as well as by our Stream pitcher and Long Last filter innovation.","We\u2019re pleased with the positive impact our product innovation had in the first half of the fiscal year and remain focused on the long-term health of this business, as we continue to invest in brand building and innovation.","Burt\u2019s Bees delivered volume and sales growth in Q2, largely due to all-time record shipments of lip care products, behind strong consumption and distribution gain. While still early, we continue to be excited about the rollout of our new cosmetics line.","To conclude Lifestyle segment, food volume and sales declined, partly due to lower shipments of KC Masterpiece barbecue sauce, as well as a late in the quarter retailer inventory adjustment. Positively, overall, Hidden Valley consumptions remained healthy and the franchise continues to deliver share gains for the 12th consecutive quarter.","Finally, turning to International, volume was flat, while sales grew 4%, mainly reflecting the benefits of pricing. We continue to focus on our Go Lean strategy to drive margin improvement in our International business, while selectively investing in Burt\u2019s Bees, RenewLife, Laundry and Home Care.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve, who will provide more information on our Q2 performance and discuss our updated outlook for the fiscal year.","Steve Robb","Well, thanks, Lisah. And we\u2019re certainly pleased with our first half sales growth of 2%. Importantly, we are on track to deliver our full year sales outlook of 1% to 3%. Our brands are performing well and we feel good about the promising innovation in the second half.","As we mentioned in our press release, we are facing elevated cost from commodities, and the tightening logistics market, which certainly impacted the second quarter and will continue through the balance of the fiscal year pressuring earnings. We believe we\u2019re taking the right actions to address these cost headwinds and build margin over the long-term.","Importantly, we are very pleased with these significant expected benefits from Tax Reform. I\u2019ll take a moment to comment on what we\u2019re seeing as a result of Tax Reform before taking you through our second quarter results.","As you know, Tax Reform brings significant changes, including the reduction of the U.S. corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, the adoption of a modified territorial approach to taxation of foreign earnings and the elimination of certain tax benefits such as the domestic manufacturing deduction.","The tax law is extensive and quite complex, and we\u2019re still working through all of its impacts, including updates for any changes to congressional, administrative or other policies, guidance or interpretations of the law.","Now based on our current understanding of the tax law, we recorded approximately $81 million of tax benefits in the second quarter or an increase of $0.61 to earnings per share, which is the main driver for our second quarter effective tax rate of a minus 3% versus 34% in the year ago period.","There are several aspects to Tax Reform that impacted our second quarter tax rate and these include $60 million benefit from the revaluation of our net federal deferred tax liability, $28 million of benefit to our current fiscal year taxable income from the reduction of the U.S. corporate federal income tax rate, these were partially offset by a $7 million one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings net of applicable foreign tax credits.","Looking forward, for fiscal year 2018, based on our current understanding and analysis, we estimate our effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 24%. Directionally, over the long-term, our tax rate is estimated to be in the mid-20s range. Bottomline, a lower tax rate moving forward is expected to significantly benefit our earnings and cash flows.","As a result, we\u2019ll continue discussions with our Board of Directors on how best to deploy the increasing cash to enhance shareholder value, consistent with our cash allocation priorities, including growing our business and returning excess cash to shareholders. For more information, please refer to our 10-Q filing, which will be available later today.","Now I\u2019ll take you through our financial results for the second quarter. Second quarter sales grew 1% on top of 5% in the year ago quarter, which includes about 1 point of volume growth and about 0.5 point of pricing, partially offset by over 1 point of unfavorable mix, reflecting strong club channel shipments.","As a reminder, second quarter sales were negatively impacted by nearly 1 point from the Aplicare divestiture and about 1 point of combined impact from retail inventory adjustments and carrier supply constraints. Much of this volume is expected to ship in the third quarter.","As I mentioned on our last earnings call, we expected gross margin to be under significant pressure in the quarter and it came in at 43%, a decrease of 170 basis points versus a year ago. These included 110 basis points of higher commodity costs, reflecting the hurricane-related pressures we discussed last quarter, as well as 90 basis points of higher logistics costs, driven in part by a further tightening of the transportation market.","Importantly, consistent with our strategy, we invested about $8 million or 60 basis points in the future growth and cost savings programs. Second quarter gross margin also includes a benefit of 170 basis points from strong cost savings.","Selling and administrative expenses were essentially flat versus year ago, and our advertising and sales promotion expenses increased $12 million versus the year ago quarter to about 10% of sales largely to support product innovation.","Net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.77, which includes the $0.61 of benefit from Tax Reform, earnings per share also reflects a reduction of $0.07 related to the incremental consumer demand building investments.","Turning to fiscal year-to-date cash flow, net cash provided by continuing operations was $322 million versus $271 million in the year ago period, driven by lower employee incentive compensation payments. As we mentioned in our press release, Tax Reform had no impact on cash flows in the second quarter.","Turning to our fiscal year 2018 outlook, as I mentioned, we continue to anticipate fiscal year sales growth to be between 1% and 3%. This includes about 3 points of incremental sales growth from our robust innovation programs, partially offset by nearly 1 point of negative impact from the Aplicare sale.","Gross margin for the full year is now expected to be down modestly, reflecting even higher cost pressures related to commodities and logistics versus our previous assumptions. As a reminder, our previously communicated fiscal year outlook already reflected elevated costs, including significant pressures from the recent hurricanes. As a result of our updated assumptions, we now anticipate gross margin to be down in the third and fourth quarters, although not to the extent seen in the second quarter.","Turning to our fiscal year 2018 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, as we mentioned in the press release, we now expect fiscal year diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $6.17 to $6.37, an increase of 15% to 19% versus year ago and above the previous range of $5.47 to $5.67.","This updated EPS range reflects an estimated benefit of $0.70 to $0.75 from Tax Reform and our expectations for lower gross margin in the second half. We\u2019ll be taking a close look at reducing selling and administrative expenses, and considering other planned adjustments to help address the pressures on our margins.","I\u2019ll close by saying that we believe we have the right strategy in place to work through these challenges, investing strongly in our product and brand differentiation remains our top priority to keep our value proposition sharp.","In addition, driving our cost savings and productivity initiatives will also consider additional price increases to support our margins, and we\u2019ll continue to drive our International Go Lean strategy to achieve operational efficiencies.","And finally, as I mentioned earlier, as a result of Tax Reform, we are looking forward to partnering with our Board of Directors to review opportunities to deploy cash to further enhance shareholder value.","Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Benno.","Benno Dorer","Thank you, Steve, and hello, everyone. Let me share with you my three key messages for today\u2019s call. First, we feel good about our first half results, execution and business fundamentals. We grew Q2 sales 1% on top of 5% in the year ago quarter, including the full impact of the Aplicare sale and the impacts from late quarter retailer inventory adjustments and transportation constraints.","Now importantly with first half sales growth of 2%, we remain on track with a 1% to 3% sales growth target for the fiscal year. We were pleased to see track channel conception tracking ahead of shipments late in the quarter, and more recently, it appears that shipments delayed by carrier constraints have shifted into January.","Importantly, execution and business fundamentals remain strong, and we continue to win with consumers and customers as evidenced by the following; year-over-year Household penetration, a critical metric continues to grow. On a 52-week basis at the end of the calendar year, 77% of our brand portfolio is growing or stable Household penetration, up from 46% just four years ago.","The majority of our portfolio is also seen by consumers who is providing better value, supported by our strong innovation programs and this is critical in an environment where value is king. And finally, we have strong execution on pricing in the U.S. and international.","Second, we\u2019re staying the course in our strategy, as we manage through a tougher cost environment. We remain committed to keep our business fundamentally strong and healthy, which remains job one in the face of higher cost environment in the U.S.","We will keep playing offense and we will continue to do that by investing in differentiated products and brands, and with a solid innovation pipeline that aims to deliver 3 points of incremental sales growth in fiscal year \u201818.","We will launch several meaningful margin-accretive innovations in the back half of the year, including the extension of our successful Clorox Scentiva platform into the Bathroom and Toilet Cleaning categories, as well as the rollout of Fresh Step Clean Paws Low Track Cat Litter and Glad trash bags (2013) with leak guard to innovations that address the biggest unmet needs in their respective categories with significant new technologies.","With strong e-commerce sales and solid returns on investment for marketing, we are investing in demand creation focused on innovation and digital marketing to engage consumers online, and we are stepping up our focus on cost reduction and margin improvements. We\u2019re investing to lower the cost of our infrastructure and enable for us to grow such our new Atlanta West facility, which expands our self-manufactured Home Care capacity.","We continue leading into waste reduction across our business to support margin expansion, including with our Go Lean strategy for international. And we\u2019re evaluating additional options to support margin improvement, including price increases, given the commodity cost environment.","Third, Tax Reform is a significant and sustained benefit for Clorox shareholders. Our commitment to shareholder value creation is as strong as ever. Our priorities for uses of cash are business growth, including targeted M&A and returning excess cash to shareholders, and consistent with those priorities, we are actively progressing discussions with the Board to put Tax Reform benefits to work for shareholders in an expedient manner.","So, in summary, while there are some near-term cost challenges for Clorox and others across our industry, we\u2019re pleased with our first half results and we\u2019re excited by the opportunities Tax Reform benefits bring to our business and to our shareholders.","We continue to have confidence in the competitiveness of our 2020 Strategy and we\u2019re optimistic about our ability to deliver growth that\u2019s profitable, sustainable and responsible, as we aim to create shareholder value over the long-term.","I\u2019d like to touch on one final and important topic before we go to Q&A, and that\u2019s our CFO transition. As you saw in our press release, Steve Robb has made the decision to retire after 29 years with the company. I know how much of you have enjoyed your interactions with him the past nearly seven years he served as our CFO.","He\u2019s led Clorox through strong period of financial performance and during his tenure as CFO, Clorox total shareholder return has climbed 165%, ahead of the S&P 500 and well ahead of the 117% TSR growth for our peer group. We\u2019ve been fortunate to have such a strong leader on The Clorox team these many years. I\u2019ll admit that I\u2019ll personally miss Steve and I am incredibly grateful to have been able to work alongside such an exemplary leader and good friend over so many years.","I am equally pleased that Steve in the company\u2019s commitment to leadership development and succession planning has enabled us to appoint such a capable and experienced leader as Kevin Jacobsen as our next CFO.","Kevin has been with Clorox for 22 years and has held leadership positions across the company in finance. He\u2019s been actively and deeply involved in the day-to-day finance operations of the company and has worked closely with Steve and the executive team to shape and develop the company\u2019s financial and capital market strategies. He will join us on the call next quarter.","We anticipate nothing less than a smooth transition and continuity. And I am pleased to Steve will stay on after March 31st in an advisory capacity through the end of the fiscal year.","And with that, here\u2019s Steve to say a few parting words before we go to Q&A.","Steve Robb","Thanks, Benno. Well, listen, it has certainly been my greatest privilege to have served as The Clorox Chief Financial Officer since 2011. And importantly, after 29 terrific years at the company, what I appreciate most are the relationships I\u2019ve established with so many people from different areas of our business, and of course, our Board of Directors and exceptional management team.","I also very much enjoyed the many discussions I\u2019ve had with you and the rest of the investment community over the years. I\u2019ve always appreciated your insights, questions and certainly your candor.","At the end of March, I\u2019ll be pleased to head over the reins to Kevin Jacobsen, a tremendous leader and a friend, who is supported by an outstanding finance organization. Clorox has the right strategy, as well as talented and passionate people who are always committed to doing the right thing for our shareholders and I leave feeling very good about the company\u2019s future.","Thank you everyone.","Benno Dorer","Thank you, Steve. And we\u2019ll now open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Dorer. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Steve Powers","Great. Thanks and congrats Steve. We\u2019ll miss you.","Steve Robb","Thank you.","Steve Powers","I am feeling actually lonely. There use to be three Steves on this call and now there\u2019s just me so. But we love working with Lisah, look forward to working with Kevin. Hey, so look, we\u2019ve talked a lot about net realized pricing dynamics on these calls over the course of time and the challenges that everyone in the industry is facing right now, just trying to hold on to pricing in the face of elevated competition, and obviously, lots of retailer pressure.","I think we see in the results this quarter just with realized price mix down essentially 3% across the core Cleaning and Household segments and in the face of rising inputs, the obvious result is the challenges on gross margin trends that you cited.","I guess, so just, as you look forward, what is the revised outlook on input cost trends that\u2019s in your outlook and how confident are you that pricing will be there, if input and transportation inflation surprises yet again on the upside, because it seems to be like a perpetual tension that we are -- that we grapple with on these calls?","Steve Robb","Yeah. Thanks, Steve. Let me lead off on this. So, first, our outlook for commodity costs. Just to ground everyone, as I said in my opening comments, we anticipate that gross margin for the full year will be down modestly, included in that is about 1 point of commodity cost headwinds, that\u2019s our best estimate at this point.","Now keep in mind, as I indicated on the previous earnings call that includes about $20 million of hurricane-related costs. Those certainly impacted our second quarter. I fully expect it will impact the third quarter, placing downward pressure on margins. But we do anticipate that over time, as we move through the fiscal year that should begin to dissipate. So some of the commodity costs, I think, are probably real and permanent. I think some of them related to the hurricane will likely dissipate.","So what are we doing about it? Well, the first thing is, it\u2019s always about growth, profitable growth throughout renovation and we\u2019re certainly feeling very good about our innovation programs and how that\u2019s delivering for the company.","The second has been cost savings. As I indicated, we did make some incremental investments in the second quarter to support our cost savings and growth initiatives, and I think, we feel very good about our three-year pipeline of cost savings initiatives.","And then, finally, after doing those things, if we need to we\u2019re not afraid to take pricing. We took it on Disinfecting Wipes, it\u2019s still early days, but I will tell you, I think, it\u2019s going well and we feel like we\u2019ve got the strength and health in our brands, that if we need to take pricing to protect margins and continue investing back in the businesses, we\u2019ll do that. So, I think, we remain confident that over the very long-term that we\u2019ve got opportunities to continue to build margin.","Benno Dorer","Yeah. Steve, this is Benno. Perhaps, one additional comment related to the ability to take pricing, which certainly seems to be an underlying part of your question. As Steve said, as cost continues to rise, we\u2019ll continue to assess additional pricing in the U.S. and international. And notably, we think that our innovation and strong marketing investments put us in a good position to do so.","I\u2019d love to share with you some information that I have about price sensitivities, perhaps, as a way to build your confidence and make sure that you can share mine, price sensitivities on our brands today are lower than they were three years ago.","And just a reminder, lower is better, over the last two years, price sensitivities decreased by 8%, whereas, importantly, on competitive brands they were up 7%. So that\u2019s a 15 point swing. That\u2019s pretty remarkable, and then, of course, as a result of the fact that we have brands that offer better value that we have invested in the business and that we have innovation.","Importantly, also our price sensitivities in absolute are about 25% lower than those of competitors in this space. So when we look at major CPG brands in our and related categories, we compare ours against those and we\u2019re seeing significant benefit again, and that\u2019s of course, because the majority of our brands are seen as better value.","So we have a strong track record executing price increases, obviously, we need to make sure that price increases should reassess them are cost justified. But we will certainly take a hard look and think that our brand certainly wants us being cautiously optimistic about taking pricing even in this environment than our Q2 pricing actions certainly has furthered that confidence.","Steve Powers","Okay. And just to be clear, the price sensitivities that you\u2019re talking, is that just a measure of elasticity that you look at, what is that exactly?","Benno Dorer","Yeah. That\u2019s hard data. Those are price elasticities.","Steve Powers","Okay.","Benno Dorer","And comes right out of our Analytics Department supported by an external supplier to make it extra objective so to speak.","Steve Powers","Okay. And I guess just to technical cleanup questions probably for you, Steve. It sounds like the consumption is that -- the fact that consumption exceeded shipments, I think, by about a 1 point this quarter, it sounded like from your comments and from what Lisah upfront that you expect essentially that to come back in reverse in the third quarter as opposed to just the absorb, just want to make sure that\u2019s the right message?","And then if you could just on the full year tax, it implies I think a tax rate, it implies a higher tax rate in the back half and is your expected go forward. So can you just help us just what the dynamics driving maybe a higher tax than what we\u2019ll see in fiscal \u201819 in the back half of \u201818, that would be helpful? Thank you.","Steve Robb","Yeah. Sure. Let me start off, absolutely, late in the quarter we ran into some carrier constraints like I think everybody across many different industries. As a result, we had orders that just didn\u2019t shipped out, it was difficult in some instances to get drivers, we\u2019re taking actions to make sure that this doesn\u2019t repeat in the future.","But it\u2019ll be challenging obviously in a tight transportation market. But in short we expect that most, if not all of that volume will come back in the third quarter and we certainly don\u2019t expect any meaningful impact on the full year based on what we know today, and of course, we will need to get through the third quarter to see that.","As it relates to the tax rate? Yes, we do anticipate the full year effective tax rate, again based on our understanding of the Tax Reform Act to be about 23% to 24%, you\u2019re going to see a fair bit of variability across the quarters and even the halves, because remember it took a very large onetime gain or adjustment if you will on a provisional basis in the second quarter and we also had to true-up the first half tax rate in the second quarter.","So as we get into the second half of the year, you\u2019re going to see difference there and you can probably just model it out. I would have you focus really on the full year tax rate and I would just one more time echo, that\u2019s based on our current understanding of what remains a very complex piece of legislation, but you\u2019re going to have some variability there.","The most important thing and I think the biggest take away here, we have historically had an effective tax rate in the 30 -- low 30s to mid-30s and on a go forward we think it\u2019s in the mid-20s. So it\u2019s a really sizable reduction and theist just because more than 80% of our sales are in the U.S.","So I think probably relative to many other companies, we will disproportionately benefit. It\u2019s going to help earnings and significantly step up the cash flow generation for the company in the coming quarters and years. And as Benno indicated, that\u2019s why we\u2019re partnering with the Board on things that we can do to enhance shareholder value around that.","Steve Powers","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from John English from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jason English","Hey, folks. Jason here but you can call me John if you so choose. Okay. Good afternoon and thank you for the question. One quick clarifying question, the press release you mentioned sort of modest gross margin compression for the year, but in the prepared remarks talking about compression both the third and fourth quarters. I can\u2019t walk away thinking maybe your definition of modest is a bit different than mine. So can you quantify that, what does modest mean?","Steve Robb","Jason, I almost want to ask you what your definition of modest is, but let me try this. When -- here is our perspective on gross margin for the year. Recognizing there is fair bit of volatility I think right now in both transportation and commodity markets. We think for the full year, gross margin will be down modestly. What does that mean, probably something less than a 1 point?","When -- in particular, when we look at the third quarter and when we look at the fourth quarter, what we believe is that the hurricane-related costs will absolutely pressure margins significantly in the third quarter consistent with I had previously said. But when you look at the third quarter gross margin, it will be down less than you saw in the second quarter.","And most importantly, when we look at the fourth quarter based on what we know, we think gross margin will be down but it will be down slightly to modestly, it\u2019s not going to be a large number and the reason for that is we\u2019ll work through those hurricane-related costs.","In addition to that, we\u2019ve been making some fairly significant investments in our supply chain to drive future cost savings and as we get into the second half of the fiscal year, you\u2019ll see less of that. It doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not investing for the three-year pipeline, it\u2019s just how the investments are folding across the year.","Jason English","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then I want to zoom in a little bit more on Glad. You mentioned the price increase you took and I think it was Waste business that sounds like it\u2019s going okay. Can you talk about the traction you\u2019re getting where you took some corrective actions on Glad and I believe when you took those corrective actions, you sort of reference setting the portfolio up from pricing architecture perspective for success on the next wave of innovation you are bringing. Maybe I missed it, but I didn\u2019t hear any comments on the next wave of innovation, can you give us any more color on what\u2019s coming down the pipeline there? Thank you.","Steve Robb","Yeah. Jason, thanks. First of all, on the pricing action, as you remember correctly, we said that we\u2019re going to take down pricing at about 40% of the Glad trash portfolio, which is the part of our portfolio that is used by consumers to enter innovation, so that was of strategic importance.","We look at that price decrease as to-date the successful and if you look at share results, what you can see over the most recent weeks is that the Glad trash business has returned to share growth. So, for what it\u2019s worth, that is something that we wanted to see and is happening, and an indicator of success.","We did comment earlier on innovation on Glad trash that\u2019s being launched right now. It\u2019s our best trash bag yet that we call Glad ForceFlex Plus with advanced protection and if you think about Glad ForceFlex, it\u2019s the strongest bag in the category and consumer preferred, because it has a unique combination of strength and odor control. But the biggest unmet consumer need to-date was leakage protection, you pour food remnants, other things, plastic cups into trash bags, there\u2019s still liquid in it and then that liquid can leak.","This is the first trash bag of its kind that addresses that consumer need and gives consumers leakage protection, and it\u2019s another example of a significant innovation, what we look at as game changing innovation, margin accretive game changing innovation, mind you coming out of our Glad joint venture.","So pricing and innovation on Glad is a one-two punch, as anticipated and we look forward to seeing this rollout in the market right now, and have every indication that this is going to be another successful innovation on this business.","Jason English","Thanks a lot guys. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Operator","Next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Andrea Teixeira","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. And I wanted to kind of go narrowing into the commentary about M&A or uses of cash that you added on the prepared remarks, and also in the press release. So I was just wondering what would be the kind of areas that you\u2019re looking for that would make sense in terms of like areas that you want to explore. In the past you have mentioned some of the Lifestyle, which you were successful with RenewLife or could we think about something bigger and more transformational? And Steve, we wish you all the best in the new phase of your life. Thank you.","Steve Robb","Well, thank you, Andrea. I appreciate that. Let me provide a perspective. First for all, again, we\u2019re excited by Tax Reform. A couple of things are true from a company investment standpoint. I would say U.S. assets, whether its investments in infrastructure, cost savings projects and even M&A are much more attractive today than they were before this was passed late December.","And the reason for that, obviously, is the fact that we\u2019ve got a 14 point reduction of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate and it just means you\u2019ve got more cash flows from all of those projects. So what I feel good about is, we\u2019ve always invested behind our brands, our businesses.","We\u2019ve invested to keep that cost savings pipeline healthy. We\u2019re going to stay the course on that. We\u2019re also going to stay the course on being discipline. All of that said, we will continue as we always have to really look for good opportunities for investment.","Our focus on M&A remains unchanged. We\u2019re open to anything that\u2019s in the best interest of shareholders. What do we like? We like businesses in the U.S. That\u2019s probably even more true today than it was a few months ago. We also like businesses with tailwinds that are margin accretive, asset light and things that are in categories, where we think we have right to win and could drive shareholder value. So, all of this remains completely unchanged.","Now what\u2019s also though as we were starting to build up excess cash and we -- and I think we\u2019ve talked to the investment community and to our Board before about that, we need to start the process of returning excess cash to shareholders. I think Tax Reform just adds to that and so we probably have even more cash to think about returning.","And if you look at our cash allocation priorities, the first is to support our business. The second is the dividend and for more than 40 years, we\u2019ve increased the dividend, and so the dividend is the number two priority.","The third has been debt and I would just say that our targeted debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 2% to 2.5%. We\u2019re sitting at about 1.7%, 1.8%. I think last quarter it was 1.8%. So we feel good about that in share repurchases.","So that\u2019s why I think Benno in his comments and my comments, we have really focused on continue investing for growth, both organically and inorganically, and then look for ways to return cash to shareholders and that\u2019s going to continue to be our focus.","Andrea Teixeira","Thank you. So if I can just ask you something about SG&A savings that you talked about as a way to mitigate this discretion on the -- kind of like more on the cost side. What should we be thinking, because obviously you\u2019re increasing and you reached a certain level of investments in E&P, are you looking more on kind of rationalization of your processes, what is exactly that kind of SG&A saving program?","Steve Robb","Yeah. Well, we have taken a very disciplined approach for many years to SG&A management. I think before many companies were doing is zero based budgeting we had been focusing on this. What we do is we apply our cost savings methodologies to SG& A as a way of taking out cost that the consumer doesn\u2019t value or they don\u2019t benefit the company and its shareholders in some way and I think we\u2019ve had a nice track record of really bringing that number down below 14%.","I just think in this difficult cost environment, we are going to take a look at discretionary expenditures where you can always make choices and whether to spend or not, where it\u2019s not going to hurt the brands, it\u2019s not going to hurt the company or our people.","So it will be a continuation of what we\u2019ve been doing, but we\u2019re probably going to lean in a bit harder to that to see how we can mitigate some of the near-term inflationary pressures certainly from these hurricanes. So it\u2019s what any good discipline company I think we tried to do in situation where you\u2019re facing some near-term cost challenges.","Andrea Teixeira","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Bonnie Herzog","All right. Hi, everyone. I am -- I had a question on the $14 million incremental demand driving investments in the quarter that you called out to support your product innovation. I guess I am just trying to better understand how and where this money was spent and was this more one-time investment or do you guys plan to increase your investment levels going forward?","And then, historically, when you\u2019ve stepped up demand building investments, how much of a lag has there been between the investment spend and then accelerating topline growth?","Steve Robb","Yeah. Thanks, Bonnie. So, first of all, I want to say, so this $14 million are not related to Tax Reform. So this is not an indication of our assessment that we need to step up spending. You will recall that we have stepped up spending already over the last three years systematically and based on strategy, and that\u2019s where it\u2019s very well for us, and we\u2019ve also commented more recently that we\u2019re generally happy with the amount of advertising sales promotion and demand spending in general that we have put in place and that we do not see a need to increase that, based on what we know today that\u2019s still our assessment.","So I would look at those $14 million versus year ago as a planned investments that coincides with innovation. This fiscal year we\u2019ve always said that advertising sales promotion spend by quarter will vary, but we\u2019re not taking up our estimate for the total year or for future years at this point, we think we\u2019re pleased with the amount of demand investment that we put in place.","So this -- that the bulk of the dollars went after innovation to support speed to shelf and awareness. So there is a time lag behind it. This does not all lead to an increase in sales in the first quarter. We should look at this investment as investment that will benefit the back half, because all of it went into equity building, awareness building, types of things on the various innovations that we\u2019ve launched. Notably Burt\u2019s Bees, and perhaps, Clorox and Scentiva, and the Fresh Step platform being three examples of where we see success and where we feel bullish and where we want to support these innovations with advertising sales promotion.","Perhaps, lastly, so I said this earlier, we\u2019ll keep playing offense. We love our strategy, we\u2019re confident in our strategy, we are winning with consumers and customers, and when we see investments just like we saw last quarter, opportunities to invest in advertising sales promotion and in gross margin to support cost savings and projects that will deliver future cost savings.","We will do that, because we manage our business for the total year, and for the long-term and not to lend our number for the quarter in a certain place. We will take -- continue to take a strategic approach and these $14 million are part of that.","Bonnie Herzog","Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. And I know you\u2019ve mentioned in the past that your focused on the investments is towards the faster growing categories, and one, that you highlighted this morning again is Burt\u2019s Bees, sounds like it\u2019s doing really well and you highlighted lipsticks. So any more color there and how that\u2019s working?","And then could you touch on international opportunities and where you\u2019re at with that for Burt\u2019s Bees? Thank you.","Benno Dorer","Yes. So we continue to like Burt\u2019s Bees and cosmetics is early, but we are excited about this. We started to expand that line in the last quarter. That will continue this quarter. We\u2019re not done per end of December. So it\u2019s a phased rollout that will coincide with retailers shelf reset dates, so Q3 will continue.","So I am excited about this, but I also say, I am as excited about the growth that we\u2019re seeing on base -- lip care. Lip balm has seen strong double-digit growth last quarter. Its growing market share and one thing we\u2019ve always done well on Burt\u2019s Bees is to expand into new categories, but do so with discipline and by discipline we mean not compromising on the core business, and that\u2019s of course, why we\u2019ll keep the focus on lip balm up.","International continues to be a solid opportunity for us. We\u2019re in more than 35 countries now and we continue to see good success innovating and expanding distribution in many International markets, focus more recently has been in Asia and we\u2019ve commented that we have used the e-commerce platform as a way to enter Mainland China through Alibaba\u2019s Tmall platform and that\u2019s going well, and we think that that has continued potential. So feel good about Burt\u2019s Bees both in the U.S., as well as in International.","Bonnie Herzog","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Kevin Grundy","Thanks. Good afternoon and I want to extend my congratulations also to Stephen and Kevin. So, best wishes to both of you. I wanted to point of clarification on the sales growth guidance. So you\u2019re mentioning the 1% to 3% year-over-year sales growth. That includes 1 point track from Aplicare, but the FX guidance and I apologize if I missed this, it was previously a 1 point headwind but the dollar has weakened now, so that should be seemly probably flat or maybe even a little bit of a help. So I was hoping you could comment broadly on your expectations for the company from a volume and price mix perspective, has that changed at all since you last updated your guidance?","And then it doesn\u2019t sound like Benno anything has changed from a category growth perspective. You sound pretty encouraged based on what you\u2019re seeing with the POS data, understanding there\u2019s a little bit of a delta there between shipments and the POS late in the quarter, but maybe you could touch on that and sort of wrapped that into this answer as well? Thanks.","Benno Dorer","Yeah. Maybe I\u2019ll start there and then Steve can answer the first part of your question. Yeah, fundamentals are pretty solid and categories are quite healthy. If you look at the tracked channels, category growth is hovering right at above 1%, that\u2019s unchanged and in line with our expectations and actually quite healthy.","And I think you all know that non-tracked channel is where the growth really is. So the growth there is stronger than 1%. So we feel good about where we are on categories. It\u2019s too early to say what Tax Reform will bring, certainly the economy is picking up and if you look at the consumer fundamentals whether that\u2019s consumer confidence, whether that\u2019s unemployment, whether that\u2019s overall consumer spend, they all look pretty good.","The question now is will it translate into our categories and we\u2019ll have to see about that. But a stable consumer environment and category environment is good for us and that\u2019s certainly what we\u2019re seeing right now.","Steve Robb","And just from sales outlook standpoint, we are thinking it remains fairly unchanged, it\u2019s consistent with what we talked about in the last quarter. We still believe we are solidly in this 1% to 3% range, of course, fiscal year-to-date we\u2019ve got 2%, obviously, we were a little disappointed that we had the carrier transportation and other issues late in the quarter, but that volume will come back in the third quarter based on what we can see.","And so I would say, generally, we\u2019re on track, innovation at 3 points looks good, Applicare is pretty much a known you can just do the math on that. Fair enough on FX, you\u2019ve always got some puts and takes on that. We have to see how that plays out for the rest of the year. But when I look at FX, price mix and just all that other stuff, it\u2019s pretty been a much a wash, and again, let\u2019s get to the next couple of quarters, but feeling confident in our sales outlook.","Kevin Grundy","Okay. Thanks. Just one quick follow up, this is on Steve Powers question earlier. Just really succinctly, is your impression now that retailers are more receptive to pricing here is -- it seemed are we waiting for wages to start to come up and more profound way? I mean, clearly, logistics costs are up and fashion costs are up, but the quarters have been what they\u2019ve been for your peers and for you guys from a margin perspective. Have we reached a sort of tipping point here where you do feel like we\u2019ll start to see pricing take hold, maybe not just in your categories, but more broadly? Thanks for the follow up.","Benno Dorer","I can\u2019t really comment on what\u2019s happening more broadly. I don\u2019t think I am -- it would be wise for me to comment. Taking pricing is not easy these days. But I think if you have market leading brands, if you invest in brand equities, if you have solid category growth, if your brands are performing well, if you have innovation, we feel like the data suggests and I quoted price sensitivities should cost justify that we are certainly assessing whether it\u2019s the right thing to do for us to get back.","We have certainly shown on Clorox Disinfecting Wipes last quarter that we can do successful -- pricing successfully. We\u2019ve also shown that we can do that in the past and I would say, certainly, if you think about categories, category growth is important for retailers, pricing often has been part of a successful recipe to grow categories and retailers probably know that.","I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s easier today, to be honest and it certainly not easy for everybody, but thinking about our fundamentals on the business, it certainly looks like we\u2019re in the best possible position relative to others to do that, should we decide that we will.","Kevin Grundy","Thanks, Benno. Good luck.","Operator","Our next question comes from Olivia Tong from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Olivia Tong","Great. Thanks and congrats to Steve and Kevin. In terms of the discussions that you\u2019re having with your Board about reinvesting some of that tax benefit back, where do you think your deficiencies lie, like can you give us some color into what you\u2019re considering more advertising, more in-store, people investments to build out capabilities, things like that?","Steve Robb","Well, again, Olivia, I guess, I would just remind everyone that one of the hallmarks of our 2020 Strategy and what we\u2019ve done successfully over the last couple of years is we\u2019ve significantly stepped up consumer demand building investments. You look at our fixed capital investments, that\u2019s been stepped up to support both growth and cost savings. So I actually feel good about the investments we\u2019ve been making.","Of course, we\u2019ll take a hard look to make sure in light of Tax Reform if there\u2019s even more that we can be doing, but I don\u2019t want to leave you with the impression that, because of Tax Reform that there\u2019s going to be a significant shift there, but we\u2019ll always take a hard look.","I think the biggest opportunity is to take a hard look at excess cash generation and look for ways to get that back to our shareholders and we have plenty of capacity, both in terms of borrowing capacity, while staying disciplined within our range, as well as just cash flow capacity to invest behind the business.","So we\u2019re in a very good spot, because of the balance sheet, because of the cash flows and now Tax Reform to be able to invest for growth, as we\u2019ve been doing, but also return cash to shareholders and those are the discussions we\u2019re having with the Board.","Olivia Tong","Got it. And I guess, specifically to Cleaning, you mentioned in the -- you mentioned the price actions on Glad, but what about wipes? I mean, because I thought that should have been already started to get reflected in Q2, yet the price mix was -- the price was down in Cleaning. So has that been implemented? What\u2019s the competitive reaction been so far to those actions and do you still expect price to be a contributor in that specific division this year?","Lisah Burhan","Olivia, it\u2019s Lisah. So CDW, Clorox Disinfecting Wipes pricing and Cleaning, this quarter is actually only about a month or so, maybe a little over a month, so we did see some lift. But more importantly though as you see the results of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, we\u2019re still growing double digits in some channels. So again to Benno\u2019s point, strength of our brands here. I hope that answers your question.","Olivia Tong","Yeah. It does. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Altobello from Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Joe Altobello","Thanks. Good morning, guys. So first question I guess for Steve. Just curious if there\u2019s any thought given to sticking out year and calling it an even 30 at Clorox?","Steve Robb","Well, keep in mind, it\u2019s been more than 29 years and I am going to stay on as Benno said, as an adviser to this company that I love so much at the end. So I\u2019ll be getting pretty close to that 30-year mark.","Joe Altobello","Hopefully you get a watch at 30-year mark. And here is my question, I guess, first, did you actually quantify the impact from delayed shipments and the retailer inventory reductions in the quarter?","Steve Robb","Yeah. We certainly did that in our opening comments. Our best estimate, of course, this is a little bit challenging to measure, but we think it\u2019s about 1 point to sales growth and so if you think of where the sales came in for the quarter, if you\u2019re looking at the way the quarter was unfolding, we were very much on track to have about an incremental point versus what we reported, but because of some of the retailer inventory adjustments, as well as the transportation challenges, that point never happened, but we think optimistically is likely to occur in the third quarter, so no impact on the full year.","Joe Altobello","So part of that point should come back we the delayed shipments that obviously should have happened around January?","Steve Robb","Yeah. Yeah.","Joe Altobello","But does the inventory reductions ease, are you seeing that or has that not happened yet?","Benno Dorer","Yeah. Joe, first of all, Steve reassured me that his 29 years felt more like 30. So, I think, we\u2019ve got that covered. We think that some of it will come back, but not all of it will come back. But, clearly, our brands turn fast and turn routinely. So, typically when inventories get too low, there is an upward adjustment.","We think we\u2019re seeing some of it come back, but perhaps, not all of it, but as Steve said, there is not going to be material for the fiscal year and in the grand scheme of things, it\u2019s end of quarter noise, which is unfortunate but a reality, but for the total fiscal year, will be a no factor.","Joe Altobello","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And just one last housekeeping item, the $6 million in other income in the quarter, what was that related to?","Steve Robb","Yeah. You\u2019re talking about the 6 -- yeah, well, the biggest thing I would say to other income and expense, if you\u2019re talking about our year-over-year change, as a reminder, it was just a $21 million charge that we took in the year ago period, that was a non-cash charge on the Aplicare, that\u2019s the biggest swing, the rest is just small puts and takes.","Joe Altobello","Okay. Perfect. Thanks, guys. Congratulations Steve. Take care.","Steve Robb","Thank you, Joe.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj from Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Ali Dibadj","Hi, guys. So I had a few questions. One was just around EBIT margin, trying to help me -- help us quantify how much it actually would be down. So gross margin clearly not going to be positive. I do wonder, maybe you can help as you answer the question talk about the supplier constraints. I mean, how do you do that? How do you release that constraint unless you pay more, I guess, so I wonder whether the gross margin pressure is even greater, so I don\u2019t know how gross margin, obviously, is going to be negative.","And on the SG&A, it\u2019s down modestly, so down 10 basis points roughly, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s modest or another word, but that\u2019s down a little bit, and you\u2019re already below the 14% level, so I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s more room to grow. So, I guess, EBIT margin, couple of quarters ago, you said it\u2019s going to be up, flat and I am just trying to get a sense of how you think about it? How much it should be down given the pressures on gross margin and SG&A, as well as you\u2019re going to advertise a little bit more it sounds like at least in the investment business?","Steve Robb","So, Ali, this is Steve. Let me -- you got a couple of questions here. Let me see if I can answer each one in turn. First let me comment about logistics, because you brought up an important point. The logistics market is tightening. In short, there\u2019s just not enough equipment, but more importantly, people to move loads in some routes.","So I think our folks very much understand the issue. It\u2019s an industry-wide issue. It\u2019s not just tied to Clorox. I do think that will put upward pressure on logistics costs. We try to reflect that in this outlook. That\u2019s one of the reasons gross margin will now be down modestly.","But importantly, we\u2019re also partnering with those companies that we work with to make sure that we\u2019ve got the equipment and the people when we need it at the right time, so that we can obviously get the orders moved out.","So not to say that it will be without challenges, but at least in this outlook we think we have properly captured as best we can the incremental cost associated with that and we are making changes in operating plans to ensure good execution as we\u2019ve always had for many, many years.","As it relates to SG&A expenses, I would point to two things. One, again, just general belt-tightening, the kinds of things you do when you face near-term cost challenges. I think the other thing is incentive compensation is going to be a bit less, because with these incremental cost pressures, obviously, our margins, gross margin and EBIT margin are going to be less than what we thought and there\u2019s been some impacts, obviously, to earnings. So that will have the effect this year of lowering SG&A a bit as well.","As far as EBIT margin, again, I would just circle back to gross margin. I think, again, it\u2019s down modestly or something less than point is probably the right way to think of the year. Long-term, we\u2019re absolutely committed to both gross margin and EBIT margin expansion in the range of 25 bps to 50 bps, but I just think this year with the commodity cost increases, the hurricanes, logistics market is going to be tougher. But, again, that\u2019s why we\u2019re making the long-term investments in innovation, growth and cost savings.","Ali Dibadj","So EBIT margin in line with gross margin, modestly down is how you would think about it?","Steve Robb","Yeah. I haven\u2019t provided outlook for that, Ali, as you can see, but I\u2019ll let you do the math. But if you just again, take our 1% to 3% sales gross margin\u2026","Ali Dibadj","Yeah.","Steve Robb","\u2026 modestly.","Ali Dibadj","Okay.","Steve Robb","I think you can probably do the math on the range.","Ali Dibadj","Okay. So then on the 1% to 3% sales, I want to zero in on the negative 3% in Household this quarter aligned with a zero volume as well. I mean the price reductions in the Bags and Wraps was relatively downplayed, I would say, certainly last quarter in our own questioning, but even at the Analyst Day, start off with just one SKU at the Analyst Day and then it was well maybe something else given competitive pressures. And I just wonder whether there\u2019s relief coming or is it just going to spread in terms of pricing, given some of the commentary from before has shifted to where we are today? So more comfort there and I get the market share point, Benno, you raised a second ago, we are okay, market share finally. But what does mean from pricing and competitive pricing as well in that market for that segments specifically?","Steve Robb","Yeah. Ali, first of all, on the Glad price increase I want to confirm that there was no change midway to our plans. So and there was nothing related to increasing competitive pressures? So plan price increase on about 40% of the volume, that\u2019s what we did to enable innovation. We executed that well, shares coming back, so we feel good about that. And now, of course, innovation is going to hit in this quarter and we feel great about that. So we feel good about Glad overall.","I\u2019d look at the Household segment and I\u2019d just stare at a 12% growth last year and 3% decline on a 12% growth, even though you never want to see segment sales decline. The net of it over two years is still positive and then if I double click on the business, we just talk Glad and Glad is a very important business for us and we feel good about where we are.","Litter was affected by said retailer inventory adjustments, but of course, we feel good about the growing shares in litter and the category growth in litter, and now importantly, also significant innovation that\u2019s going to come out this quarter, which is our best tested innovation that we\u2019ve ever had on this business. So we\u2019ve been on a run in litter and we think we can keep going.","Charcoal was down, yes, but again, off of a double-digit increase last year and also in a quarter that\u2019s by far the slowest mover given the winter season in that category and RenewLife is up double digits, doing particularly well in e-commerce, for prospective, a year ago, e-commerce on that business was 4% of sales.","This last quarter, it was 20% of sales, which shows you that our continued efforts to invest and be a leader in e-commerce are bearing fruit and in 2018 we will be able to add innovation to that business.","We are launching a line of non-GMO and organic probiotics, the first of its kind on RenewLife and we\u2019re also launching a kids line for all kids development stages, which is an important consumer need and something we\u2019re excited about. So if I look at the individual businesses and how I feel in the Household segment, I can\u2019t help but feel good and optimistic.","Ali Dibadj","Okay. Last question, do you feel the same about International in terms of the trends there, I mean, clearly, pricing was good, volume was just flat, Asia and Latin America still in a little bit more pain, you had been on this trajectory of improving margins there and a little bit rough for now. How do you feel similarly about International, which does especially Asian and Latin American volumes were less a little bit?","Benno Dorer","Yeah. I feel not -- that in international, we\u2019re not yet where we want to be. We\u2019ve had number of really solid quarters. This was an okay quarter. But, clearly, cost continues to be challenged, because we\u2019re seeing continued inflation. FX also is still a headwind. We\u2019re looking at Argentina, and which of course, is the biggest -- a big market for us internationally and that recovery in their economy is progressing but requires a lot more time.","So, with International, I would say, we\u2019re doing everything that we can control, which is to Go Lean, which is to invest selectively in profitable growth opportunities, save costs, drive business towards higher margin initiatives well. But we\u2019re doing that in a continued very difficult macroeconomic environment and for that business to do, as well as we want to, we need that macroeconomic environment to ease up and we haven\u2019t seen that in Q2.","Steve Robb","And Ali, this is Steve, if I can just build on Benno\u2019s comments, as it relates to at least the earnings when you look at the reported decrease, just a perspective. It represents about $5 million decrease to earnings on a year-over-year basis, well over half of that was actually decisions we made in the quarter to step up consumer demand building investments and then the balance was just some of the cost pressures and investments we\u2019re making around Go Lean.","So, you have to put that in context as well. There\u2019s going to be variability across margins and profitability in that business. But I do think we\u2019re taking the right long-term actions to keep that moving in the right direction.","Ali Dibadj","Okay. Thanks a lot and congrats again Steve.","Steve Robb","Thanks, Ali.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Gere from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jason Gere","Okay. Good afternoon and Steve best of luck. I will make this very brief. I guess the one thing that I wanted to talk a little bit more was on the advertising budget that you\u2019re set for this year. So can you maybe talk -- in the context of the competitive environment, are you seeing anything in any of your categories where you have to shift some of your advertising towards gross to net, is there anything out there that would prohibit that and then just with the rising cost inflation, do you think that you would definitely see the gross to net actually start to come down a little bit, because everyone\u2019s trying to get more price realizations. So I was wondering if maybe you can just talk about where we should be thinking about advertising for the year and relative to gross to net impact that would be in the gross margin? Thank you.","Benno Dorer","Yeah. So we have, Jason, in the past commented on advertising sales promotion being about 10% of net sales and we think that that\u2019s the right number. I -- again, taxes don\u2019t make a difference to that and the competitive environment has not changed. So we feel like it\u2019s a solid number to deliver our sales growth that we have in our outlook.","In terms of trade spend, we have as you know over the last three years stepped it up in particular to support innovation, so that\u2019s strategic spend, some of it was related to elevated competitive activity in certain categories like Wipes. But most of it to support product innovation, so that\u2019s good spend.","That\u2019s maybe one where over time, long-term there may be an opportunity for that to perhaps go the other way and go down, because whenever you step up spending, what you do as a next step and that\u2019s certainly been the hallmark for our company is to look at the effectiveness of every single dollar, you learn and then you learn that perhaps there\u2019s opportunity you to optimize and then you optimize.","So I think that for the coming fiscal years there\u2019s got to be opportunities for us to optimize that and then either increase the ROI between the existing spending or perhaps take that down, that remains to be seen. But advertising sales promotion, unless something significant happens in the marketplace, is exactly where we want it to be. It will continue to vary by quarter, but for the total fiscal year it\u2019s about in the right place.","Jason Gere","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Shirley Serrao","Hi. Good morning. This is actually Shirley Serrao on behalf of Lauren Lieberman. Just wanted to dig a little bit deeper into some of the volume strengths in Lifestyle, I noticed double-digit volume gains in water filters, so just sort of the first positive data point we\u2019ve seen on volumes in that category in a while. So just some details there around initiatives you pursued in the quarter and any early read on some of the innovations that have come through? Thank you.","Lisah Burhan","Hey, Shirley. How are you? This is Lisah. So, Brita, as we said in the scripts, my opening remarks today, it\u2019s really club strength that we saw, and importantly, it\u2019s due to innovation that we have, as you know, we launched our new Stream pitcher couple of quarters ago and recently also Long Last filter innovation and both have really made a difference in the category growth, as well as our shares.","Shirley Serrao","Great. Thank you and good luck Steve.","Steve Robb","Thank you. Shirley.","Lisah Burhan","So we will take one more question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney from Consumer Edge. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Feeney","Thanks so much. Steve, Kevin, congratulations. I wanted to first ask two questions. First, Benno, in historical, I know you know a little bit about history of Glad and how these things tend to go, and historically, I\u2019ve noticed in the data that considering the magnitude and surprising magnitude of resin, raw material price increases generally, the cadence of private label price increase seems to be pretty slow. I am wondering how -- historically, how long does it take for pricing to from higher commodities make its way through the category? Just from your past experience, I know you don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to happen this time, just some perspective on that would be helpful?","And secondly, I think, Google Trends has flu searches up 400% year-over-year. I am wondering if historically, flu scares like we have right now have had any major impact on your business. It\u2019s certainly been something you\u2019ve talked about, I think, Steve has talked about at CAGNY several times as a theme for your company and a way of marketing your products. I wonder if you\u2019re having any either interest of retailers or increased takeaway at this point? Thank you.","Benno Dorer","Yeah. On resin and pricing, Jonathan, so, first of all, we\u2019re not in a coffee industry where we passed through goodness and we take pricing right away. So there is a time lag and it all depends on what price, resin cost plateau we are expecting. So we\u2019re pricing strategically. We\u2019re pricing with an eye on the mid-term and we price depending on future expectations, as well as the actual cost development.","So really depends, I can tell you that, we\u2019re looking at where cost is right now, which is certainly elevated, but importantly, we\u2019re looking at where cost is expected to be mid-term over the next six months to 12 months and we need to believe that both of it is going to be up or stay up significantly as a way to justify pricing.","We\u2019re able to execute pricing when we execute pricing and certainly we have done that on this business and other businesses in the past, with some lead time, it does require planning with customers and that takes months time.","So I don\u2019t think about this is something that is just done in a snap and with a switch of a button. So there is lead time associated with it, because pricing for us is strategic matter and doing it right means giving it some lead time.","On flu season, so we think that may have been a tiny a little bit in Q2 but not much. Certainly, Disinfecting Wipes grew almost double digits, high-single digits, double digits in the club channel. We also saw market shares up on Clorox Bleach, which of course, offers disinfecting properties and Clorox Clean-Up spray, which is also a disinfectant.","So there\u2019s certainly strength in that our disinfecting category as consumers still look to us to help them with products that help them get rid of germs. But its -- I don\u2019t think that it was materially on Q2, Q3 it\u2019s a little early to say. Typically February, of course, is another peak season. There are typically two peak months in the flu season, that\u2019s November and February, so we\u2019re entering February remains to be seen.","What I can tell you is that we\u2019re planning every season with our customers as if it is flu season and we have enough product in store and enough capacity also to be able to fully supply should there be increased demand, but it\u2019s just a little early. But we see what you see it, certainly an elevated flu season and we\u2019re able to react and supply customers and consumers should we need to.","Jonathan Feeney","Thank you.","Steve Robb","Thanks.","Benno Dorer","So, I think that\u2019s it. Thank you, everyone, and I look forward to speaking with all of you again in May when we share our third quarter results. Have a good weekend.","Operator","That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect."],"5383":["The Clorox Co.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Clorox Company First Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Mr. Steve Austenfeld, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Mr. Austenfeld, you may begin your conference.","Steven Austenfeld - Vice President-Investor Relations","Great, thank you. Welcome everyone and thank you for joining Clorox's first quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, Clorox's CEO and Steve Robb, our Chief Financial Officer. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website TheCloroxCompany.com.","Let me remind you that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt-to-EBITDA and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures, determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the Financial Results area of our website, as well as in our filings with the SEC.

The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.","Turning to our prepared remarks, I'll cover highlights of our first quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our financial results and our outlook for fiscal year 2016. And finally, Benno will close with his perspective and open up the call for Q&A.","So turning to our top line results; as this quarter's performance highlights, the investments we're making behind innovation and strong marketing communications to drive profitable and consistent growth are working. On the top line in Q1, volume and sales were each up 3%. Despite about three percentage points of unfavorable foreign currency impact and slightly higher trade spending and supportive in-store merchandising, sales grew solidly, reflecting the benefit of about two points of pricing and slightly favorable mix. On a currency-neutral basis, sales grew 6%. All of our U.S. businesses grew sales in the quarter, as did our International business on a currency-neutral basis.","In the U.S., 13-week market shares increased a half point versus the year-ago quarter to 23.8%. This is the highest quarterly gain, as well as the highest absolute market share since the conversion three years ago to the broader [MULA] reporting format. It's rewarding to see our investments in higher margin, faster growing opportunities paying off in stronger market share.","More specifically, six of our eight U.S. retail business units increased market share, with particularly strong gains in Home Care and Charcoal. In addition to market share improvement, driving improved category trends remains a top priority for us. And during the quarter, our categories were up 1.8 points, slightly lower than recent quarters but still very healthy.","With that, I'll review our first quarter results by segment. In our Cleaning segment, Q1 volume increased 5% and sales grew 6%, largely due to higher shipments of Home Care products. In Home Care, which is our largest U.S. business unit, sales increased strongly. The gain was driven by growth in all segments of our Home Care business, with Clorox-branded products performing well and particular strength in Clorox disinfecting wipes, during the back-to-school season as well as behind our new wipe products, which have been supported by advertising and strong retail merchandising execution. As noted a moment ago, Home Care was a key contributor to our strong market share growth, and has now achieved more than five quarters of market share gains.","Heading into our second quarter, we are closely watching this fall's cold and flu trends, which have been relatively muted so far and recognize we'll also be lapping strong growth in the year-ago quarter in our Professional Products healthcare business, due to Ebola and Enterovirus concerns last year. That said, our Q1 results demonstrate that our Home Care business is on solid ground.","Laundry business sales also increased in the quarter, driven impart by the benefit of an earlier Clorox bleach price increase. From a market share standpoint, our overall bleach share dipped slightly in the quarter after six consecutive quarters of share growth. At the same time, we were very pleased to see strong share growth on our Splash-Less Bleach products, which are a trade up from our regular product. Splash-Less Bleach is performing very well with a market share in its segment that is higher than our share in the regular bleach segment.","In addition, Splash-Less Bleach is adding household penetration at the expense of private label, as we drive growth with new sizes and dedicated advertising. Consistent with our strategy, this is a great example of leaning-in on a margin-accretive product to drive profitable growth.","In our Household segment, we delivered 1% volume growth and 5% sales growth. The segment's top-line results were driven by strong performance in our Bags and Wraps and our Charcoal business. In Bags and Wraps, sales were up mid-single-digits behind innovation in premium trash bags, as well as a price increase taken in late calendar year 2014. Similar to my comments on the bleach business, where we're benefiting from growth on higher-margin Splash-Less Bleach, the Glad business is driving category trade-up from our base trash bags to our higher-margin premium trash bag business, represented by our Force Flex and OdorShield offerings.","Following a number of new scent offerings, new Glad OdorShield trash bags with the scent of Gain have been particularly successful, supported by advertising and strong digital marketing. Further, we look forward to sharing with you additional innovation in Glad's premium trash bag segment as part of our next quarter's discussion.","In the Charcoal business, sales also grew strongly, and frankly, much stronger than anticipated, due to promotions, consumption, and outstanding retail execution behind the U.S. Labor Day holiday.","In the quarter, we were lapping double-digit growth a year ago, so we were very pleased to deliver strong results on top of that. There is some risk, especially given the wet El Nino weather pattern being forecast, that consumption will slow, particularly following last year's mid-single-digit growth. But while whether may temper near-term results, our Charcoal business is clearly performing very well.","Turning to Cat Litter, while our volume declined in this competitive category, Q1 sales increased behind the performance of our lightweight products. While competition in this category will remain intense over the next several quarters, we're looking forward to the launch of new Fresh Step with Febreze in calendar year 2016, which will make us stronger competitively.","In our Lifestyle segment, volume increased 8% and sales grew 7%, with volume and sales improving in all three business units; Food, Burt's Bees and Brita. Our Food business performed strongly behind our Ranch with bottled salad dressings, such as Ranch with sweet chili and ranch with roasted garlic, as well as our dry Hidden Valley dressing and dip mixes such as Greek yogurt. On our Burt's Bees business, volume and sales grew double-digits, largely due to innovation in face care products, as well as the earlier timing of holiday shipments.","Facial towelettes also continue to perform very strongly. Burt's Bees now holds the number four market share position in the lip crayon category, an impressive position recognizing the crayon category includes both conventional and natural offerings such as Burt's Bees.","Turning to our Brita water filtration business, our strategy to drive trial of pour-through systems showed encouraging results in Q1, delivering mid-single-digit volume and sales growth behind strong execution during the back-to-school period and incremental distribution gains in ecommerce.","Turning to International, volume for the quarter was flat, whereas sales declined 8%, reflecting unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, essentially across all markets. On a currency-neutral basis, sales for International grew a solid 5%. Steve will discuss our financial results momentarily, but we're pleased that our Go Lean strategy in International is working, as we focus on pricing maximization, cost savings, rightsizing our infrastructure and optimizing demand creation.","Strong execution of our go lean strategy in International is particularly important as we look ahead to the balance of the fiscal year, recognizing the possibility that foreign currency headwinds may worsen, which would put additional pressure on profitability in our International business.","So to wrap up, although just 90 days into the fiscal year, we're pleased with our top-line performance. As we look to the balance of the fiscal year 2016, we remain committed to growing profitably through strong brand investment and clearly demonstrating through our 3D brand-building approach, the value that our products provide consumers regardless of price point.","Factoring in our strong Q1 sales performance, as well as our outlook for unfavorable foreign exchange rates, as well as stepped-up competitive pressure in the second half of the year, we continue to anticipate sales to be about flat to up 1% or 3% to 4% on a currency-neutral basis.","Now I'll turn it over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our Q1 performance and our outlook for fiscal year 2016.","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Steve and welcome, everyone. Well, we're very pleased with the company's strong performance in the first quarter. We grew sales across all our U.S. businesses and in International on a currency-neutral basis. Importantly, we expanded our margins by driving productivity and cost savings programs across all our U.S. business segments.","Now I'll turn to our financial results for the quarter. In our first quarter, sales grew 3%, with volume and pricing contributing a combined impact of nearly six points. Sales results also reflected nearly three points of unfavorable foreign exchange rates and higher trade promotion spending.","Gross margin for the quarter increased 220 basis points to 45%, reflecting 140 basis points of cost savings, 110 basis points of pricing benefit and 100 basis points from favorable commodity costs. These factors were partially offset by 120 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs.","Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was essentially flat versus year ago, at 13.4% of sales. Advertising and sales promotion investment for the quarter was closed to 9% of sales, essentially flat compared to the year-ago period. In total, demand-building investments including trade promotion spending increased $13 million, reflecting support behind product innovation, which contributed to category growth and market share gains in the quarter.","Net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of a $1.32, a 20% increase versus a year ago quarter, driven largely by strong sales growth and margin expansion. Free cash flow for the quarter was $107 million, or about 8% of sales compared with $205 million in the year-ago quarter or about 15% of sales. Free cash flow in the first quarter was lower, largely due to higher performance-based employee incentive compensation payments related to our strong fiscal-year 2015 results.","Looking forward, we anticipate free cash flow for the fiscal year to be about 10% of the sales. In the first quarter, we repurchased about 1 million shares of our common stock at a cost of about $112 million to offset stock-option dilution. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.8 times, below our target range of 2 times to 2.5 times.","Now we'll turn to our fiscal year 2016 outlook. We continue to anticipate sales growth of flat to up 1% or 3% to 4% on a currency-neutral basis, reflecting strong first quarter sales growth and slower growth rates in subsequent quarters. Our sales outlook also takes into account the following factors; ongoing investment behind our innovation program, which we continue to anticipate delivering about 3 points of incremental sales growth for the full year.","Continued slowing International economies with about 3 points of impact from foreign currency declines. With the ongoing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we're closely monitoring the possibility of worsening exchange rates in the balance of the fiscal year. And finally, in light of the positive momentum in our market shares, we're preparing to address potential heightened competitive activity in the second half of the fiscal year, particularly in key categories, including Bags and Wraps, Litter and Home Care.","Turning to margin, previously we had assumed gross margin will be flat for the full fiscal year. However, based on our strong first quarter results, we now anticipate gross margin to increase modestly or about 25 basis points to 50 basis points. The benefit of cost savings, pricing and lower commodity costs are expected to be partially offset by inflation, impacting manufacturing and logistics costs.","Other moderating factors include higher trade promotion spending and foreign currency declines. Importantly, we anticipate reinvesting a significant portion of the benefits realized from lower commodity costs to drive top line growth. We continue to anticipate selling and administrative expenses to be slightly below 14% of sales in fiscal year 2016.","We also continue to anticipate EBIT margin to increase in the range of 25 basis points to 50 basis points, reflecting modest gross margin expansion, moderated by incremental investments in consumer demand building programs and increased support behind our cost savings programs to fuel profitable growth. We continue to anticipate our fiscal-year 2016 tax rate on earnings from continuing operations to be in the range of 34% to 35%. And net of all of these factors, we continue to anticipate our fiscal-year 2016 outlook for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.68 to $4.83.","Considering the strength of our first quarter results and our confidence in executing our strategy, we're cautiously optimistic about the possibility of being in the upper end of our outlook ranges for sales and earnings. However, it's still early in the year and we need more time to see how the macroeconomic and competitive challenges unfold in the remainder of the fiscal year.","In closing, we feel really good about delivering a strong first quarter. As we look to the remainder of fiscal 2016, we anticipate facing a more challenging second half. Nonetheless, we remain committed to focusing on profitable growth and reinvesting in our business, particularly behind product innovation and our cost savings programs will continue to be priorities.","With that, I'll turn it over to Benno.","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Steve. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. There are three things we hope you'll take away from today's call. First, our 2020 strategy is continuing to work and that's reflected in our Q1 results. Second, because our strategy is working, we're staying the course, investing in the business to drive profitable growth. And third, we continue to face pronounced headwinds in the balance of the year and we've reflected that in our outlook.","So let me summarize my perspective on these three areas. First, our Q1 results are strong indicators our strategy is working. Some highlights include the fact that our U.S. business achieved the strongest sales growth in several years and delivered it across all segments. Further, while currency effects are real and cannot be dismissed, our International business delivered solid sales growth on a currency-neutral basis and saw positive results for our go lean strategy, with solid profit growth in U.S. dollars, as well as in local currencies.","In addition, strong innovation coupled with our increased demand-building investments translated to category growth, as well as the highest quarterly market share growth and our highest absolute U.S. market share in three years.","And our focus on profitable growth, supported by trade-up, cost savings and commodity tailwinds help drive meaningful margin expansion in the quarter, with margin growth in all four segments, including International. So our strategy is continuing to work and we're staying the course to drive growth that is profitable and sustainable.","In International, where our business remains challenged, in great part due to foreign currencies, much like every other U.S. based company, I'm proud of the tough decisions our team has made to improve profitability across that business for our shareholders.","In particular, I believe the four pillars of our go lean strategy, pricing, cost savings, rightsizing and optimizing demand spending will pay-off in the long term. I feel very good about the future of this business, recognizing the fundamental strength of our brands in many countries.","Turing to the U.S., we have a robust innovation pipeline across our portfolio and will continue investing in the business and focusing on delivering strong value to consumers. Our domestic business is healthy and we intend to continue supporting it with advertising and marketing communications, sales and trade promotion spending and strong retail execution.","As many of you heard at our Analyst Meeting in early October, our analysis of traditional versus digital forms of brand building show that we're keenly focused on ROIs and ensuring our demand creation dollars work hard for us. We feel good about where we are. At the same time, it's still very early in the year.","As Steve Robb discussed, going forward, we'll be monitoring foreign exchange rates for the balance of the fiscal year and commodity costs, which remain volatile and tend to rise over time. All said, we are very pleased with our first quarter performance and cautiously optimistic about the remainder of the year, which is reflected in what I believe to be a balanced outlook.","And with that, let's open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Dorer. We'll go first to Wendy Nickelson with Citi.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, good morning. Thank you. Could you talk a little bit more about your expectations for the back half of the year? And I appreciate that at this point you'd probably want to leave your guidance a little on the conservative side, but are you seeing anything specific from competitors either in terms of more aggressive pricing or stepped up promotion or specific new products coming to the market that make you think you're going to have to respond more aggressively?","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Wendy good afternoon. Thank you for the question. We think we have a balanced outlook that certainly reflects the strength of our execution, but also as you say, what we anticipate to be a tougher competitive environment in the back half, specifically as it relates to three categories. First Home Care, where we've gained a lot of market share for five quarters now and typically what happens is that, that will yield a stronger competitive reaction to that market share growth.","In Cat Litter, as is very well known by now, we have innovation coming up in the back half and we think that that's going to increase the competitive activity in the category, and then in Glad, the third category where we are expecting somewhat heightened competitive activity. Commodities have been somewhat of a tailwind and we are investing in growth, reinvesting effectively much of that commodities goodness back in the business.","So we expect that the competitive activity in these three categories is going to be heightened. We reflected that in our outlook and I said we want to continue to stay in the driver seat and invest in profitable growth.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And can you talk specifically about your outlook on the advertising line? I know that was down just a hair in the first quarter, but it's obviously not hurting you. And I know you talked a lot at the Analyst Day about how digital marketing is helping you. But for the balance of the year are you still going to be in that kind of 9% range as a percentage of sales on advertising?","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","What we said in the past, Wendy, which continues to be true is that there are always be fluctuations in spending by quarter, both in terms of the absolute spend as well as where the dollars are spent. I think we have noted today in our remarks that our total demand spend for the last quarter actually continued to be up. It happened this quarter that some of the increase spend was in trade, where we are getting good returns, in particular, because we're investing in trial building activities behind our innovation.","And I think what we've also said, which continues to be true is that we're committed to increasing our overall demand spend by 100 basis points or 1% of sales. So that all will remain on track and certainly what continues to be true is that we remain very committed to the spend in digital, where we're getting very strong returns. Digital will be up to north of 40% of our working media spend this year, up from 30% last year. So advertising sales promotion, as well as our total demand spend will continue to be on track and will continue to rise for the balance of the fiscal year.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Terrific. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll go next to Steve Powers with UBS.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Great, thanks. Good morning. So just, Benno, to clarify, so \u2013 or maybe Steve, the gross margin upside that you now see, are you saying that you expect most of it to flow through to advertising as the year progresses?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's correct. Essentially, as you noted, we raised our gross margin outlook to be up modestly for the full year. And our expectation is that's going to be largely offset by reinvesting some of the strong earnings we saw in the first quarter back into consumer demand building investments, primarily focused on the advertising in the second half. And we're also going to invest some of that in our cost savings initiatives where we've got some good projects underway to build a pipeline of ideas over the next few years.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's great. And then, again on the elevated spending in the back half on trade and promotion, how much of that is things that you expect to have to respond to versus things that you know, you yourselves will do in support of new innovation?","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","It's the latter, Steve. As you know, part of our strategy is to continue to invest in profitable growth and profitable certainly needs to be underlined here. We're very committed to growth being profitable. So these are all investments that we're proactively taking in support of our strategy. They're not to respond to others' activities.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then, lastly, kind of stepping back, since we last spoke, Walmart has signaled a series of changes in its priorities and I'm wondering if you could help us assess how you see the situation developing, not only at Walmart but across the industry as Walmart seeks to step up its investment again in lower prices, optimize assortment and a streamlined supply chain? How does that impact your planning, whether operationally, financially or both? Thanks.","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","Steve, what we're seeing Walmart as well as other retailers do is invest in growth. As you look at some of the remarks from Walmart, they are investing in improving their shopper experience, that should benefit Clorox as well as other players in the industry. All of our conversations with retailers today are about growth and about investing in growth, in particular, around the innovation, and that's perhaps also why we're seeing such strong top-line growth at this point, because we have a very strong and balanced innovation portfolio across all of our brands and our retailers are recognizing us for that. So, we're staying the course with our strategy and we're seeing success as certainly as evidenced by this last quarter sales results.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good afternoon, guys.","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Jason.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I'm going to echo a question that was asked on the Church & Dwight call earlier today because I think it's obviously relevant for your gross margin progression. Your view of resin costs on a go-forward, as we look at the cost curve, it looks like it stayed early last year only to creep back up in the summer and then fade again. So, it looks like from where we sit today this is a benefit that should keep on giving throughout your fiscal year, albeit at likely a more muted rate than we've seen before. Is that consistent with how you see things going forward? And if not, how's it different?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, Jason, as you know, resin costs are particularly volatile, but here's what we would say. We'd certainly expect to get commodity cost tailwinds this fiscal year. And most of that will be driven by resin. And I also think it'll over index in the first half of the fiscal. If you go back to fiscal 2015, beginning in the fourth quarter, we saw commodity cost tailwinds, that continues straight to the first quarter, which came in as expected. And I would expect that to continue through Q2.","As we get into the second half of the fiscal year, two things we're going to monitor very closely, number one is just energy prices, because that can have an influencing impact. Second is overseas markets because it is a supply and demand market. And then third, production capacity appears to be somewhat tight depending on who you listen to and it doesn't take much of a supply disruption to cause those markets to move up quickly. So, I think we'll get tailwinds for the year, they will be more in the first half than the second half and we'll start to lap that as we move through the fiscal year.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Fair enough. One more and then I'll pass it on. You are not the first one to talk about moving dollars into trade and out of traditional pull-type vehicles, although I appreciate the aggregate spend is growing for you. Is it possible that we're on the cusp of more aggressive pricing action as the slush fund of money that's sitting within the trade budgets out there grows?","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","So, Jason, what we said is that dollars will fluctuate and I can tell you that most of our trade dollars are going into everyday low pricing. So, I can't comment on slush funds, the way you mentioned it. What we're seeing is that trade promotion these days is particularly effective to support trial in our innovations. And that's why the dollars go there, but what we've also said is that we're seeing equally strong returns in our digital and social media spend and we expect dollars to continue to flow in those two areas. So, dollars will flow back and forth, I wouldn't read too much into what's happening in one quarter, but it's certainly true that right now our trade funds in support of our innovation are particularly effective.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Very good. Thanks a lot and congratulations on the good start to the year.","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. I want to go back to Walmart for a second because you certainly said that they want investment to grow, and of course. But if you think about Walmart-specific virtual cycle, they have a very clear piece which is lower prices to the consumer drive sales growth. So, assuming there's elasticity there is their hope. And they've committed billions of dollars of price reinvestments, not this year but starting next year. So, I'm wondering, you guys are in such a strong position with them, you have great relationships with them. But that's somewhat of a double-edged sword because you do have the ability to drive volume in their store, traffic in their store, and volume out of lower prices. I understand you're trying to push innovation but might it be more difficult going forward given their shift and their commitment around pricing and their modus operandi, which is lower prices drives traffic in their store? How have your conversations shifted? And probably not yet but do you anticipate them shifting going forward on that specific topic?","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Ali, so in many ways the way I'd look at this is, Walmart has always been about very competitive prices every day and they're going perhaps back to what has worked so well for Walmart for so many years and frankly what's helped build our business with them to such a strong position. Our conversations really have not changed, what Walmart's looking for is growth that is profitable and that's exactly what we're looking for. What Walmart is looking for is innovation and they've been particularly receptive, as have many other retailers, to strong innovation and there isn't a lot of great innovation out there in the marketplace right now, as we look at various categories and as you know, we're very committed to innovation, our innovation program is pretty strong.","Fundamentally, they invest in where we invest in. They invest in neighborhood markets and they invest in ecommerce. Those are areas that we're very interested in and those are areas where market-leading brands will benefit from. So, I can tell you that while I, as you'll appreciate, can't comment on specific conversations that we'll have within every day, the conversations we have with them are predominantly around growth and that's not changed over the last few years.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So, do you think the commitment to have \"billions of dollars\" of reinvestment in price more as posturing? Or \u2013 I guess I'll leave it there. Do you think there's more posturing in that sense?","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","We'll have to let this play out, certainly. What I can tell you, as it relates to our categories is that our price elasticity certainly are such that, we have been rewarded and Walmart has been rewarded by trade up, by pricing, by all the activities that we have put in place over the last few years to grow, but also grow profitability. And we continue to have a very productive dialog with Walmart on what drives CAGR growth and what drives profitable growth. As you know, we advise them on their categories and most of the categories that we're in, so it's all I can say at this point.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. So if you perhaps use that as a jumping board and you look at your operating margins at 20.6%, again, background, biggest retailer took a profit warning, which are pretty much tying peak margins in Q1, at least, how sustainable should we think of those given what we just talked about, but also just given what you guys just said from a competitive perspective likely getting tougher, commodities being in this kind of good spot in terms of area under the curve as commodities are down and pricing is up? How should we think about the sustainability of the operating margin number you guys delivered this quarter going forward, stable, down, not just this year but beyond that, as well?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Ali. This is Steve. Let me try this. Over the long-term we continue to remain committed to adding about 25 bps to 50 bps of the EBIT margin expansion as we've talked for some time. And we're certainly feeling very good about a relative fast start this fiscal year to do it and feel very good about our plans to do that. I think as you look at the longer term, our belief is the combination of margin-accretive innovation, the opportunity to take targeted pricing, particularly in International markets and even rebuild our International margins through our go lean approach, as well as SG&A management, all of those things and our cost savings programs I think gives us confidence that we're going to deliver good, steady margin expansion. But you will have some variability across the quarters, and we've had a really good quarter in the first quarter. I think \u2013 I feel very good about the first half, but I think the second half margins will probably be a bit challenged, just for all the reasons that we've talked about. So, in short, feel good about the long-term plans that we have for the company, but you'll have some ups and downs over time across the quarters.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Appreciate the perspective. Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks so much. You talked about the potential for heightened promotional activity and competition by peers. Have you already started seeing some of that or is that more of an expectation that it will pick up as the year progresses? Because I'm trying to understand, if you grew 20% EPS in Q1, what's going to drive it to just basically flat for the rest of the year?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, in terms of the heightened competition, I think we've seen elevated competition for quite some time. I think as Benno and Steve had pointed out in their opening comments, historically when you build market share the way we have consistently quarter-after-quarter, the competition tends to come back a bit stronger. So we're certainly coming off of very strong first quarter results and it just seems prudent to us to take some of that strength and invest it back behind these innovation programs and consumer demand building programs that we have. And so that's really what we're signaling. We have yet to see another leg up in the competitive set, but as you know these tend to run in six-month windows, so we're being what we think is very responsible by stepping up the level of investment in anticipation of increased competition in the second half but we will have to see.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks. And then on the spread between volume and price, it seems to be contributing about equitably to sales right now. But would you expect that to continue to be the case as the year progresses or will you see a little bit of shift there?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think a couple of things, you're going to see us be primarily volume led, so volume will certainly drive top-line growth for the company, but in particular from our International markets, pricing will also contribute, but again a lot of that's just to try to mitigate some of the inflationary headwinds and the FX headwinds that we're seeing, so it's going to move up and down over the quarters, but it should primarily be volume with some pricing.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And then just lastly on International, both price and volume decelerated this quarter. And volume was flat for the first time in quite a while, so can you talk about some of the drivers there? And is that sort of the run rate that you expect for the year what you did in Q1?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Again, felt pretty good about the performance of our International business in the first quarter. I think looking forward, I do think it's going to get increasingly difficult in International, particularly as we move through the second half. And the reason for that is we are continuing to see a sequential slowdown in some of the emerging markets in our business and we've talked that for some time.","And foreign currency headwinds, when we went into this year, we thought foreign currency headwinds would be about three point drag on top-line sales. If you just look at the U.S. dollar spot rates today, they're a bit worse than we have thought. And so that's certainly something we're watching closely and we're expecting a significant devaluation in Argentina.","So, I do think the International business is probably going to continue to face a tough situation over the next couple of quarters, which is why again, what we're trying to do is focus on innovation in that business, focus on driving cost savings, leveraging our U.S. capabilities and really take targeted pricing where we can get it. And we think over the long-term, these things will not only rebuild margins, but position ourselves for even better healthier growth out of our International business.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right. Thanks, Steve.","Operator","We'll go next to Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys, good morning.","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Bill.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Was there any big distribution expansion this quarter that drove some of that organic growth or was it mostly comp store growth?","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","No significant distribution expansion. Certainly we've gained distribution behind our innovations as we said, but nothing beyond that, Bill.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Got you. And did you guys see that Wall Street Journal article about the guy running the U.S. was walking into stores and saw six different SKUs of ranch salad dressing. Is there something to read from that? I know it's random, but it sort of stood out at me that he picked on something so small in the big scheme of things for Walmart?","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","We've certainly seen that, Bill. Again, our food business, our ranch business, is very strong, as I think you've seen it's very strong with Walmart, but also very strong with other customers. It should also be noted that our SKU productivity is higher than that of the competition so that might be relevant here too, which worked particularly well.","Recently is \u2013 our innovation I think again that's something that Walmart has been so responsive to is innovation in the category to grow sales and grow profitably and the flavored ranches, in particular, chili, roasted garlic, avocado, cucumber have been very successful and we've gained more than 10 share points in that important segment over the last quarter.","So, we're doubling down on investment in that, as well as in the other areas of ranch, as you know, food is a growth business for us and we'll continue to invest and we feel good about where we are.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. I mean the reason I ask is because it seems like you guys are very diffusive about this heightened competitive activity. My understanding is most of the discussions on pricing and planogram stuff for next year, at least the front half of next year, has already been done. So was there anything in these conversations that made you kind of put that in the press release a couple of times and then talk about it three or four times in the earnings call?","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","No I mean, look \u2013 I feel like, what we've done is point out the strengths across the portfolio in food and elsewhere. Again, we've read that and you never like to be singled out in a comment like that, but what matters the most is what we're seeing every day in our consumption results and those are strong. And we've shared with you during the Analyst Day and perhaps also a little bit today about our continued strong plans for the ranch business going forward, mostly based on innovation and strong brand-building investments, so I feel good about that business and that's all there is to it.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, got you. And then just one quick one for Steve. So the gross debt to EBITDA is like 1.8 times. I think the net debt is more like 1.5 times. I mean are you going to revisit your target there, 2 times to 2.5 times? Is there stuff you can do to get that leverage ratio back into the comfort zone? Because it seems like also this quarter, puts and takes it was a seasonally weak cash flow quarter and you're still only at 1.8 times. So, my guess is as the year progresses, that cash flow balance is just going to get bigger \u2013 the cash balance is just going to get bigger and bigger.","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. It's a good problem to have. We're throwing off a lot of cash, obviously, as a company, certainly through fiscal 2015 and felt good about our cash flow generation in the first quarter and outlook for the full year. The debt-to-EBITDA is at 1.8 times, we're quite comfortable with it being below to 2 times to 2.5 times at this point because it does give us dry powder to be able to do things in the future, including M&A activity and return cash back to shareholders.","So, no plans to change the target of 2 times to 2.5 times, but as we've said before, we're not concerned if it's a bit below that. I think over the long-term, we're either going to get traction in the M&A market and again we're always working on a pipeline of ideas, or if we start to see a lot of cash building up, we'll have to take a hard look at the dividend in partnership with the board, as well as just share buybacks and look for ways to get the money back to our shareholders. Again, the key for us is to be disciplined in capital allocation. So, no change in strategy or framework and we'll continue to monitor it and in partnership with the board, take a hard look at that over time.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","We'll go next to Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, thanks. Guys, I guess, a little more clarity on the increased competition. It sounds like you guys have spent on innovation, spent on trade promotion, gaining lots of share. And now it sounds like in anticipation of a response from your competitors to your success, you're planning even higher spending. So, in other words, from a position of strength. I just want to clarify, do I have that right? Again, I think you said you haven't seen any uptick, you're just spending more in anticipation of competitors spending more? Is that right?","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, as you know, Chris, increasing our spending has been part of our 2020 strategy and I think as we can see in this quarter's results, that's working very well. So, what we feel is prudent to do here in anticipation of what we do believe to be heightened competitive activity in these three categories is to stay in the driver's seat. We do not like to respond to competition, we do not like to respond after the fact. We like to anticipate and we like to continue to invest in what's working for us already and we see an opportunity in these three categories to continue to up our investment.","That's all there is to it. It is about staying in the driver's seat. It's about staying on strategy and staying true to the promise of increasing our advertising and sales promotion investment and in some cases, trade promotion investment behind what's working.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Perfect. Thank you. And just one last one on manufacturing logistics. Steve, can you just go through again, just give us an update on what's going on there, the impact of the trucking situation and the height of that, the general absolute drag you're seeing and what the prospects are for that over the next couple of quarters?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So we're continuing to see inflation in both manufacturing and logistics costs. This quarter came in at about 120 basis points, pretty consistent with what we've been seeing, which is north of about a point over time. And I would imagine that that's going to continue to be a drag on margins through this year and probably well into the future.","I will say on the logistics side, while costs are elevated, they have appeared to have stabilized somewhat more recently. So we're cautiously optimistic that we may have seen the peak on this one, but keep in mind a lot of the inflationary pressures in manufacturing and logistics come from the emerging markets, where they're running double-digit rates of inflation. So, it's been a headwind. It's going to continue to be a headwind and that's why I think for us the key is going to be to really lean into the cost savings, the pricing and the other things that we can do to offset that headwind.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","We'll go next to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, good morning. We've covered a lot. I just had one quick question on something in the press release that you mentioned around the timing of customer collections impacting cash flow. Is that something specific to a retailer or something that should just kind of even itself out over the course of the year?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","In short, it will even itself out over the course of the year. It's really a reflection of the strength of the sales that we saw in the first quarter. And we have standard collection terms for all of our customers, and we saw a lot of strong shipments as we moved through the quarter and I would expect that to cash flow as we go through the second quarter. I guess what I'd have you know is that the free cash flow for the company as a percentage of sales, we think it'll be about 10% this year. And so we feel like we're off to a pretty good start to deliver another healthy year of cash flow for the investors.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Dorer, I would now like to turn the program back to you.","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.

Our Professional Products business grew sales strongly in FY 2019 wrapping up the year with a double-digit sales growth in Q4.","We've introduced a number of innovation platforms in this business over time and they continue to build momentum as we keep expanding distribution in the institutional channel. For example the Clorox Healthcare hydrogen peroxide line which launched in FY 2013; and Clorox Healthcare Fuzion, an FY 2017 innovation both have strong double-digit growth -- double-digit volume growth for the year.","In Home Care, sales grew both in Q4 and for the full year. Q4 sales were up behind broad-based volume growth including record quarterly shipments of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes.","While early, we're encouraged by the improvement we're seeing in wipes after beginning to address some of the short-term competitive headwinds we discussed in Q3. We'll continue to sharpen our consumer value equation in FY 2020 with an eye on long-term profitable growth for the category and for the brand. We're looking forward to sharing with you an exciting innovation in wipes this fall at our Analyst Day.","Lastly, within the Cleaning segment. Our Laundry business sales were up for the quarter and about flat for the full year. We're excited to share that we'll be doing another round of compaction starting in FY 2020 which will drive category growth, while at the same time reducing overall environmental footprint for Clorox Liquid Bleach.","While we're pleased with the results we're seeing in three of our four segments this quarter, results in Household were disappointing. Q4 sales were down 11% and full year sales were down 5%, driven mainly by declines in Charcoal and Glad. Turning around these businesses is as a top priority for us and we expect to see improvements in the back half of FY 2020.","Now, let's go through the drivers business-by-business. In Charcoal, full year sales declined with Q4 sales down by double-digits due mainly to distribution losses and lower merchandising primarily at two large customers in mass and home hardware during the peak grilling periods in the quarter.","We've seen retailers investing more space in support of alternative grilling fuels like lump and pellets, a growth area where we will begin to play in 2020. As a result we experienced lower merchandising support and loss some distribution while competitors have gained.","These results are disappointing and we need to launch innovation that allows us to participate in these growing alternative grilling fuel segments and better differentiate Kingsford from competitors. We're working on a stronger 2020 season plan that will include new Kingsford pellets, product improvement across our base Kingsford product, Charcoal, and robust marketing support that will continue to focus on growing household penetration.","While we expect the front half of the fiscal to be challenged we believe we'll turn we returned the business to growth in the back half of the fiscal based on the strength of the Kingsford brand, and our expectation that we will significantly improve our business plans for consumers and for retailers.","In our Bags and Wraps business, sales were down for the fiscal year with a double-digit decline in Q4. Sales and share declines continued to be driven mainly by wider price gaps as well as distribution losses in select portions of the portfolio, which we've discussed last quarter.","In Q3, we began increasing our trade investments to narrow these price gaps, and while it's early, we're starting to see green shoots in select areas where we've seen improvements and shares. Starting this Q1, we're implementing incremental trade investments that will fully close the remaining price gap and that should lead to further improvements on the business.","In fiscal year 2020, we're also planning to launch various new products in the fast-growing scented trash bag segment, where Glad has commending equity over competitors. We expect to return to growth by the back half of fiscal year after we cycled through the impact of distribution losses. Longer-term, we continue to feel good about the value creation potential of this business. Our confidence comes from our dedication and significant investment in differentiated consumer and technology-led innovation.","For perspective, we filed about 70 patents in the past five years, while our closest branded competitors -- competitor had none. We believe these type of investments will continue to drive long-term profitable growth for the brand and for the category.","Turning to RenewLife. Sales were down by double-digits for Q4 and for the year. As we mentioned last quarter, we remain focused on restoring growth in this business and have confidence in the probiotic category and in our ability to differentiate our brand from competition by emphasizing our product efficacy.","A continued bright spot in Household segment is our Cat Litter business, where Q4 sales were up on top of double-digit growth in the year ago period mainly due to the benefits of pricing. For the full year, sales were up by double-digits behind additional investment and Fresh Step Clean Paws innovation platform, which offered two new product option in the fiscal year, Mediterranean Lavender scent and unscented.","In our Lifestyle segment, sales for the quarter were flat, while sales for the full year were up 17%, primarily reflecting the benefit of Nutranext acquisition. Burt's Bees had a very strong quarter of sales growth behind a record quarterly shipment in lip care and face care and sales were up for the full year as well. Successful innovation in these categories including overnight lips cloves, lip oil and sensitive skin care product continues to drive share growth for the brand.","The business has another strong pipeline of innovation plan for FY 2020, including our recently launched lip butters, which offer a trade-up from traditional of lip balms with an experiential form flavor and texture as well as on-trend botanical blend flavors that are relevant to younger consumers. We'll have more to share with you on this in October.","As we mark the one-year anniversary of our acquisition of Nutranext, sales were up for the quarter driven by strong growth in our strategic brands, which represents about 80% of the portfolio. We continue to be pleased with the progress we've made on this business, including the integration and of high expectation for FY 2020.","Food sales were flat for the quarter, but up for the year. Q4 results reflect continued strength in bottled Hidden Valley dressing offset by lower shipments in Dry Hidden Valley products, which had double-digit growth in the year ago quarter. Ready-to-eat dips are off to a good start with early indications that the innovation is expanding usage occasions for the brand. Overall, the brand remains healthy and enjoyed its 18th consecutive quarter of share growth.","Wrapping up the Lifestyle segment. Brita sales were down for the quarter, while being up for the full year. The Q4 sales decline was driven by timing of trade spending. This benefited Q3 sales, which were up by high single-digits, while drawing from this quarter. Importantly, this business is healthy as reflected by a solid and consistent volume growth in all four quarters of FY 2019.","Consumption has continued to grow for eight consecutive quarters, and we're pleased to see our tracked channel market share up nearly one point in the last 13 weeks. We're also excited by the strong start of our bottle innovation, which was supported to increase demand spending.","Finally, turning to International. Sales decreased 4% in Q4, driven by about 15 points of unfavorable foreign currency impact primarily in Argentina, which were partially offset by the benefits of price increases and volume growth. Europe and China both recorded double-digit volume growth for the quarter behind the strong performance of Cat Litter and Burt's Bees.","Sales were down 6% for the full year, reflecting 15 points of headwinds from foreign currency impact. At the same time, we're pleased to see solid sales growth in a number of markets.","With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin, who will discuss our Q4 and fiscal year financial performance as well as outlook for fiscal year 2020.","Kevin Jacobsen","Thank you, Lisah, and thank you everyone for joining us today. Overall results were mixed in fiscal year 2019, reflecting a strong start in the first half followed by more mixed results in the third and fourth quarters, primarily behind challenges in select categories.","At the same time, I'm pleased with the progress we've made rebuilding gross margin allowing us to invest more in our brands and technology transformation to support long-term profitable growth.","Starting with our fourth quarter results, sales decreased 4% reflecting a negative three point impact from lower volume and two points of negative impact from unfavorable foreign currencies, partially offset by the benefit of price increases net of trade spending. It's important to note that the three point volume decline in the quarter was driven by our Charcoal business and to a lesser extent our Glad business.","Gross margin for the quarter came in at 45.1%, an increase of 110 basis points compared to 44% in the year ago quarter. Fourth quarter gross margin included 220 basis points of benefit from pricing and 150 basis points from cost savings, partially offset by 150 basis points of increased trade spending and 90 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs.","Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were essentially flat versus the year ago quarter. Advertising and sales promotion investment levels as a percentage of sales came in at about 10% with spending for our U.S. retail business coming in at about 11% for the second straight quarter.","Our effective tax rate was about 17% versus about 29% in the year ago quarter, primarily driven by the benefit of U.S. tax reform. Net of all these factors, we delivered diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.88 versus $1.66 in the year ago quarter an increase of 13%.","Now, I'll turn to our results for the full fiscal year. Sales grew 1% reflecting three points of net benefit from the Nutranext acquisition and Aplicare divestiture offset by a negative three-point impact from unfavorable foreign currencies.","Fiscal year sales also include the benefit of price increases net of trade spending. Gross margin for the fiscal year came in at 43.9% versus 43.7% in fiscal year 2018 an increase of 20 basis points.","Fiscal year gross margin results include the benefits of 190 basis points of pricing and 150 basis points of cost savings, partially offset by 190 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs and 60 basis points of unfavorable commodities. In fiscal year 2019, we delivered more than $120 million in cost savings hitting 12 consecutive years of generating more than $100 million in annual cost savings.","Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales for the full fiscal year were essentially flat versus year ago as ongoing investments and the Nutranext acquisition were offset by progress from our ongoing productivity initiatives as well as lower incentive compensation accruals consistent with our performance-based compensation philosophy.","Advertising and sales promotion spending as a percentage of sales for fiscal year 2019 increased to about 10% versus about 9% year ago, with U.S. Retail spending at about 11% for the fiscal year. For the full fiscal year, our effective tax rate was about 20% compared to the year ago rate of about 22%, primarily reflecting the benefit of U.S. tax reform.","Net of all these factors, our fiscal year diluted EPS from continuing operations was $6.32 compared with $6.26 in fiscal year 2018, an increase of 1% on top of a 17% increase in fiscal year 2018.","Turning to cash flow for the fiscal year. Net cash provided by continuing operations in fiscal year 2019 came in at $992 million versus $976 million in the prior year. Our track record of generating strong cash flow and maintaining a healthy balance sheet enables us to continue to invest in the long-term health of our business and return excess cash to our shareholders.","In fiscal year 2019, we increased our dividend by 10% on top of a 14% increase year ago, which continues our long history of increasing our dividend. In addition, as part of our ongoing commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, we returned $328 million as part of our open-market share repurchase program. At the end of the fiscal year 2019, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.1 which is at the low end of our target range of two to 2.5 times.","Now, I'll turn to our fiscal year 2020 outlook. We expect fiscal year sales to be in the range of flat to 2% reflecting 1% to 3% organic sales growth, primarily driven by innovation partially offset by about one point of negative impact from foreign currency headwinds. It's important to note that we anticipate first half sales to be at the low end of our range with our assumption for first quarter sales to be down as we work to restore growth on our Glad and Charcoal businesses.","For the second half of the fiscal year, we anticipate sales to be at the higher end of our range, consistent with our expectation for these two businesses to return to growth in the back half of the fiscal year.","Turning to gross margin, we expect fiscal year gross margin to be about flat to down slightly, reflecting our expectation for flat gross margin prior to additional supply chain investments we are making to drive long-term value creation.","One great example is, our first half investment to support the initial rollout of Clorox Liquid Bleach Compaction in the spring of 2020, offering improved consumer experience and meaningful sustainability benefits. We look forward to the value the Bleach Compaction will bring to the category.","We expect fiscal year advertising and sales promotion investment levels to be at about 10% of sales. Selling and administrative expenses are expected to come in, at about 14% of sales, reflecting ongoing acquisition-related investments as well as technology transformation investments to support long-term growth and cost savings.","In addition, we anticipate more normalized levels of performance-based incentive compensation. We expect fiscal year EBIT margin to be about flat to down slightly, based on our expectations for fiscal year gross margin.","Importantly, we believe we are taking the necessary actions to expand EBIT margin in the back half of the fiscal year, at a level more in line with our long-term financial targets of 25 to 50 basis points.","Our outlook also includes the ongoing benefits of U.S. tax reform, with the assumption that our fiscal year tax rate will be in the range of 22% to 23%. This includes the ongoing benefits of U.S. tax reform, partially offset by our expectation for lower excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.","Net of all of these factors, fiscal year 2020 diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $6.30 to $6.50. Consistent with our anticipated fiscal year sales progression, we expect diluted EPS to be more muted in the first half as we work through challenges on our Glad and Charcoal business and stronger in the second half.","In closing, I'd like to reinforce that I believe we are taking the right actions to address the short-term challenges we're facing in key categories, while making sure we continue to invest in the long-term health of our business.","Last quarter, we discussed the challenges we are facing on our Glad and Wipes businesses. And while there's more work to be done on Glad, we're certainly pleased with the progress with Wipes. We delivered record quarterly shipments in the quarter on top of record shipments in the year ago period.","In addition, although we expected to face some bumpiness in parts of our portfolio, we believe the cost justified pricing was a right decision. Pricing and strong cost savings enabled us to address the ongoing inflationary environment we have been operating in over the last three years, while also enabling us to continue investing behind our brands and categories in support of long-term value creation.","Moving forward, we're addressing Glad and Charcoal head-on while remaining focused on profitable growth. We will continue to invest strongly in our brands, including innovation, which will help us continue to deliver superior consumer value. We will continue to lean into our cost savings program and productivity initiatives to create fuel for growth.","Additionally, we will continue to drive our Go Lean strategy in International. We're pleased with the businesses' strong operational progress in the face of ongoing currency inflation. And finally, I'd like to make sure that it's clear that after we work through the challenges we're facing in a couple of our businesses, Clorox will be in a position to deliver result that are more in line with our long-term financial goals.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Benno.","Benno Dorer","Hello, everyone, and thank you, Kevin. Here are my three key messages for you today: first, as we discussed fiscal year 2019 was mixed, which was reflected in our back half results. We're currently facing persistent challenges in Charcoal and Glad, that impacted our top line results in the back half and full fiscal year of 2019.","We will work to significantly strengthen our Charcoal business plans as well as address the pricing-related issues and drive innovation on Glad. We anticipate these businesses will return to growth in the back half of fiscal year 2020.","At the same time, I feel good about the strength in other parts of our portfolio with strong fiscal year sales growth in a number of businesses. We delivered broad-based growth across Home Care, our largest SBU with Clorox Disinfecting Wipes to returning to growth in the fourth quarter.","We also delivered sales growth in our Professional Products business, double-digit sales growth in Litter, strong sales growth in Burt's Bees as well as sales increases in Food and Brita. I also feel good about our innovation program.","It continues to drive consumer value that is superior through differentiation in our products and brands with the introduction of consumer meaningful innovations in fiscal year 2019, including Hidden Valley Ready-to-Eat Dips, Brita Filtering Water Bottles and several new Burt's Bees lip and face care products.","We're also pleased to see continued momentum behind our Clorox Scentiva and Fresh Step Clean Paws platforms. I continue to be pleased with the Nutranext acquisition, which delivered robust growth in the fourth quarter and contributed strongly to total company fiscal year sales behind an integration that remains on track.","I'm also pleased with our strong progress in our International business. In the face of significant FX headwinds, our Go Lean strategy has delivered six consecutive quarters of profit growth. We're also seeing strong momentum behind growth platforms in several regions.","E-commerce continued to be an increasingly meaningful growth engine for the company and now represents about 8% of total company sales. And finally, we expanded gross margin, which was the key to creating fuel for brand growth in fiscal year 2019.","My second message is that our fiscal year 2020 outlook represents an appropriate plan reflecting the balance of addressing the shorter-term challenges on Charcoal and Glad, as well as our plans to continue leaning into driving long-term profitable growth. I'd like to reinforce what Kevin said about pricing and that is, notwithstanding the temporary bumpiness we had anticipated, we firmly believe cost-justified pricing was the right decision for the long term.","Pricing helped address the ongoing inflationary environment we've been facing and supported continued investment in long-term brands and category growth. An immediate priority for us certainly is getting Charcoal and Glad back on track. As I mentioned, based on our expectations to deliver stronger business plans for Charcoal and move past the issues post pricing on Glad, we anticipate these two businesses to return to growth in the second half.","That all said, we will remain principled in our commitment to long-term profitable growth and will continue to pursue strategic investments that will lay the groundwork for the future of the company. As Kevin mentioned, we're investing in the first half of the fiscal year to support the initial launch of Clorox Liquid Bleach Compaction in the spring of 2020, which we're very excited about.","And, of course, we'll be relentless in building brands that consumers love and lean into demand-building investments including increased advertising dollars at about 10% of sales. Above all, innovation remains a powerful lever for us as it's the force behind long-term profitable growth. We're pleased that 2020 will bring another robust pipeline of innovation, led by the compaction of Clorox Liquid Bleach, innovation on Clorox Wipes and new products and other businesses, including several innovations on Glad and in Burt's Bees Lip and Face Care.","We will drive trial and awareness on these new products while also continuing to invest behind several of the innovation platforms we've already introduced, such as Clorox Scentiva, Fresh Step Clean Paws, Brita Filtering Water Bottles and Hidden Valley Ready-to-Eat Dips, which all have meaningful upside potential.","Finally, the third message I'll share with you today is that we're confident in the strategic path we are laying out to continue Clorox' track record of delivering long-term shareholder value. Our new strategy is supported by a proven business model of leading brands in attractive midsize categories, strong operational execution based on innovation and an unwavering commitment to good growth, growth that's profitable, sustainable and responsible.","We have a strong global portfolio with the majority of global sales made up of number one and number two brands. We're expanding this portfolio further into health and wellness with our Nutranext acquisition, which is currently expected to deliver double-digit sales growth in fiscal year 2020. We're confident that robust innovation program will continue to deliver superior consumer value by differentiating our products and brands.","Building on our 2020 strategy, which delivered strong shareholder return, we're confident our new strategy will continue to guide us in delivering strong cost savings, generating strong cash flows, leading to top-tier ROIC and maintaining a healthy balance sheet. We remain committed to putting our strong cash flow to work, by investing in the long-term health of our business and rewarding our shareholders. And finally we'll continue our focus on growing the right way, by living our values and driving sustainability in our products and operations. We'll continue to be a mission-driven business with the goal to create long-term value for all of our stakeholders.","And with that, operator, you may now open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Dorer. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.","Steve Powers","Hey, thanks. So, I think, you've been pretty clear about the challenges that you face in wipes and Charcoal. But how should we think about the rest of the business in fiscal 2020, because there is roughly a 300 basis point spread between the midpoint of your stated long-term goal of 3% to 5% growth and this year's flat to 2% outlook?","And based on what we've heard from others, just a broader backdrop for CPG demand seems pretty favorable. So I'd like to assume the rest of the portfolio, ex-Glad and ex-Charcoal would be performing in line with at least the low end to mid-range of that long-term outlook. But if you're expecting both Glad and Charcoal to return to growth in the back half, it seems to imply the other 80% of the portfolio might also end up below even at 3% levels. So could you just help me with that and frame for me how you think that portfolio is shaping up health-wise versus the long term?","Kevin Jacobsen","Hey, Steve. Good morning. This is Kevin and I appreciate the question. And let me give you a perspective on how we're feeling about the portfolio broadly, separating the businesses, as we've talk about, that have been more challenge Glad and coal. As you heard in our prepared remarks, our expectations when we think about fiscal year 2020 is, those two businesses will be a drag on our performance in the front half or we work to get them back on track.","But if I set those aside, we feel very good broadly about the balance of our portfolio. If you look at Cleaning, Lifestyle and International, all performing well over fiscal year 2019. And when I look at fiscal year 2020 our expectation, specifically in the U.S. is that, we'll be generating top-line growth consistent with our long-term growth algorithm. As you know it's 2% to 4% in the U.S. And our expectation is we're going to be back in that range in the back half of the year as we get coal and Glad back on track.","Steve Powers","Okay. So did -- any drag versus the long-term algorithm ex-Glad, ex-Charcoal is really just International and some of the macro factors. Is that fair?","Kevin Jacobsen","Yes. That's right. And for International, we've been targeting 5% to 7%. We've continued to be challenged by FX headwinds. That was particularly true in 2019 where we had about a 15-point headwind. I'd tell you as we look at 2020 we think it's going to be a slightly better environment, but we still think it's going to be a material headwind to our International business. On a currency neutral basis they are certainly growing within that 5% to 7% if not higher, but being held back by FX at this point.","Steve Powers","Okay. Great. And then Kevin, why don't I get you talking? You gave some helpful phasing information for the -- on the top-line for the year. But could you talk to us through any phasing dynamics on the gross margin line or the advertising lines? And then I'll pass it on. Thanks.","Kevin Jacobsen","Sure. Maybe on advertising, I would say, typically we will spend the money based on when it's most advantageous for us. It tends to be a bit more loaded in the back half just based on the innovation cycle. I would expect to see something similar to that although I don't expect to see any big changes but maybe a little bit heavier on the back half.","And then on gross margin gross margin I think will be fairly consistent across the year. The investments we're making will put a little bit of downward pressure on margin. As we mentioned we're investing in compaction. They will be launching in the spring. We've got another project we're not ready to talk about publicly, but will continue to invest in it and we'll talk about that at a future date.","Steve Powers","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Kevin Jacobsen","Thanks, Steve,","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Strycula with UBS.","Steve Strycula","Good afternoon. So first a more mechanical question and then more of a strategic question for Benno. So for Kevin on the repurchase activity is any repurchase activity be embedded in the fiscal 2020 outlook? And can you give us some kind of magnitude? And were you back in the market in the fourth quarter?","Kevin Jacobsen","Yes. Thanks, Steve. I can start with our repurchase program. If I just think broadly about fiscal year 2019, we're quite pleased. We returned about $1.2 billion to shareholders in 2019. That's a combination of both dividend and share repurchases. That's up about 60% versus fiscal year 2018 as you've seen us lean into the dividend over the last couple of increases. That also includes on our share repurchase program, we have now executed about $425 million against my $2 billion authorization so about 20% of the authorization, which also included about $250 million in Q4.","As I look forward, as we've talked before this is not an ASR so I do not have a defined number of shares I'm going to buy. We've got an internal program we manage. What I'd tell you is I would have you believe that within the outlook we provide there may be some level of share repurchases. I'm not going to provide a forecast on it. But to extent, it materially changes one way or the another -- I'd certainly update you. But for now you should assume it's embedded within our EPS outlook range.","Steve Strycula","Okay. And then Benno just wanted to understand strategically how should we think about compaction phasing through the business particularly as it launches in the spring? And then what has been the feedback in your conversations with retailers as to -- that gives you confidence that some of those businesses can accelerate in the back half of next year?","Benno Dorer","Yes. So Bleach Compaction -- Steve will start in quarter three. And typically if you recall our progress on compaction over the last few times we did it we've got some experience on this the last time we did it was 2013. It takes several quarters so we'd expect to be through all of this in several stages early fiscal year 2021. So feel good about that project.","Clearly as we think about our coal and Glad -- so maybe focus your question on coal. Coal the issue is really that we're out of sync with two large customers. And we have to get back in sync strategically with those two large customers. We also need better demand-building plans. Obviously, results are disappointing there as Lisah said. And we owe our customers and consumers better plans with the right innovation. And as Lisah said, we will have product improvements as well as new Kingsford pellets in market for the next grilling season.","We'll have continued strong marketing support focused on household penetration and brand value and excitement. And again, we need to have the right merchandising plans with all retailers consistently. And we clearly didn't succeed with that in Q4. So that's the work ahead. That's work that our company has a strong track record of. We feel like we know what the opportunity is on this business as well as on Glad. And we have to get back to doing what we do best.","Steve Strycula","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","All right. Thank you. I actually have a big-picture question on your strategy. The strategy you guys just discussed and know what you're going to be unveiling further at your October Analyst Day doesn't necessarily sound like a major change from your current strategy. But I guess you have been thinking about and looking back at just subpar results in FY 2019 and a pretty weak outlook for FY 2020, I'm wondering if you guys think you might need to make more radical changes either in your strategy or possibly in the composition of your portfolio. I guess I'm really trying to understand what gives you the confidence that some of the changes you're making will result in the improvements in the second half.","Benno Dorer","Yes. Thanks Bonnie. So, we don't need that -- we don't think that that's needed, so no major change in strategy. If we think about the issues, again, they're largely contained to two businesses. And again if I think about Charcoal, we're mostly off with two customers.","And Glad is really tied to post-pricing issues where we've clearly seen widened price gaps which we're addressing and we also saw some distribution bumpiness probably across the portfolio which we can also trace back to pricing. And again we have reaffirmed that pricing is really necessary and we'll stand by that. So, feeling good about the rest of the portfolio.","Frankly, as Kevin said, it's generally solid. We'll cycle through in the post pricing bumpiness. We think we can address the Glad and Charcoal issues. And then we really think we have robust plans for fiscal year 2020 and beyond. Strong advertising sales promotion that's still relevant. We have brands that consumers love. We have our consumer value propositions and measure continued to be positive.","We have robust innovation plans. We're leaning to cost savings. And we will continue to deliver strong cash flow and then put that to work for our shareholders. We think all of the fundamentals that have worked so well for our shareholders with our company strategically for a long period of time continue to remain in place and we're excited to update you on where we're going in October in New York.","But you should expect us to lean into components that will make a difference to consumers, to customers, and to shareholders. But what you cannot expect is the departure from a strategic path that's worked for the company for a very long time.","Bonnie Herzog","Okay. Honestly that's really helpful. And if I may I wanted to circle back to something you touched on and maybe drill down a little bit further on the higher trade promo spending and whether it's working in Household or specifically in bags.","And should we assume that you're going to need to pull a little bit further on that lever as you touched on the gap from they're at which is further implied in your guidance? And then trying to think about how much do you have to pull there and whether or not that will impact work.","And then as we think about Charcoal and you touched on this, but should we also think about the promo lever being pulled in that category too for your turnaround, or is that just more dependent on some of the merchandising in innovation you mentioned?","Benno Dorer","Yes. Charcoal first. So, right merchandising, right innovation, right demand plans that's really the answer here. On Glad if you think about what we did in Q4, we did up our trade investments to narrow the price gaps. That led to sequential improvements and we're clearly seeing green shoots.","If you look at for instance the grocery channel where that was implemented first, shares have improved and now -- are now about flat. But I think we would say that the lien interest trade spend wasn't enough which is why in Q1 we're planning for additional trade spend that will fully close the widened gaps that we experienced post pricing.","So, that's working. But perhaps the progress on this has been overshadowed by distribution losses tied to bumpiness that we have explained. And then frankly it has been a little worse than we had anticipated in Q4 and has worsened and overshadowed the progress through the trade investments. So, feel good about the added trade investments that we're putting in place in Q1.","And then to make full progress in the back half what's needed is to cycle through those distribution losses and to bring innovation back. And as Lisah said earlier, we have several initiatives planned for the back half. And with all those plans combined, we expect a return to growth and we feel pretty good about the prospects of that.","Bonnie Herzog","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.","Andrea Teixeira","Hi, good morning. Thank you. So, I just want to go back to distribution just a follow-up. And I appreciate Benno your commentary about Charcoal execution in two other customers. So, I think like you know what's happening there.","And I get that obviously you may not you also said that you don't expect the shelf to flag the distribution losses that you've had until the next calendar year -- early calendar year, right? So the second half of fiscal.","So, I'm just trying to understand what makes you confident that these two retailers will put you back on shelf and that your value proposition will be more compelling in the second half of fiscal 2020 than what you have in place right now? And are you planning to or price rollbacks then for -- I mean probably -- Charcoal is probably not the case but for Glad?","And then a separate question would be on supplements on Lifestyle. I know you feel confident about Nutranext that it checks the boxes on collagen and protein trends. But you mentioned that you may decide in the last quarter conference call to a different question that I post to you that you may decide to increase investments in RenewLife in fiscal 2020. Is that a possibility now or not yet? Thank you.","Benno Dorer","Yes. So, a lot in there Andrea. Let me try to unpack this a little bit. So on Glad, as I just said, we will add more trade promotion in the first quarter of this fiscal year to fully close the gap. What makes me confident on coal that we are going to be more strategically aligned with the two retailers were clearly -- we need to do better. That's up on -- that's up to us. I feel like the combination of our plans with product improvements with new line extensions and pellets, with stronger marketing support and very collaborates -- collaborative talks with both retailers that are going on right now and better plans we will earn their confidence back. It's something that we have a strong track record of and it's something that we need to get back to.","Regarding your question on vitamins, minerals and supplements, clearly, feel good about Nutranext as is evidenced by the progress throughout fiscal year 2019 and the expected double-digit growth in fiscal year 2020. RenewLife is clearly still lagging behind. Fiscal year 2019 was a disappointing fiscal year on that business and Q4 was no exception.","For perspective, RenewLife represents a little over 1% of sales. So perhaps in terms of materiality, it's less of a factor here, but we're also working on better plans. We remain excited about the long-term potential in digestive wellness. We have a strong brand. We have strong capabilities in this category. The process will take time, but feel good about the long-term prospect on RenewLife too.","Andrea Teixeira","Very helpful. Thank you, Benno.","Operator","Next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America.","Olivia Tong","Great. Thanks. Wanted to talk a little bit about tracked versus the untracked. You talked about some of the shelf space losses that you've seen in the mass and the home retailer. But it's kind of surprising to see that the spread between tracked and untracked widened as dramatically as it did this quarter and also in a different direction than usual. So is it fair to assume that there were disproportionate losses in club and online? If so can you kind of give us a little bit more color into the channels? And then, I mean, you -- is there like stuff that came that you would -- that was up for bid and the margin profile just didn't quite meet your standards.","Benno Dorer","Yeah. Thanks Olivia. So, clearly as I would unpack this if you think about Q4 volume versus year ago the drag really is entirely at Kingsford and Glad. And within those two businesses, frankly, the majority of the drag is Kingsford. And then if you then think about the Kingsford business as we said, we're -- the issues were with two major customers. And one of them is untracked right in the home hardware channel and that -- this is a big quarter for Kingsford and this is a big customer. So the Q4 impact of that was unusual and significant. And I would point you to that single retailer in a very big business in a very big quarter to account for much of the issue.","Olivia Tong ","And then haven't talked a ton about wipes. But last quarter you sounded pretty down deep and cautious about where you are in the Disinfecting Wipes lifecycle. But then this quarter you reported record quarterly shipments of the wipes. So can you talk a little bit about what's the change there and the dynamics that kind of led to such a snapback in the underlying trends of course excluding the impact of cold and flu last quarter? Thank you.","Benno Dorer","Yeah. So positive about the progress on wipes, clearly, a competitive category still. But last quarter we talked to you about putting trade spend in place to counter what is an elevated competitive activity on the promotional side. We returned to growth this last quarter on top of a very strong quarter in the previous fiscal year. And we were able to make the trade spend increase begin to work.","And now for fiscal year 2020, we continue to feel good about this business. We expect this trade investment to continue to work. And importantly, at the Analyst Day, we'll share with you significant innovation both on the base as well as with the new product that we're very excited about. So this is a stronghold for our company. It's a growth engine for our company and we expect that to continue.","Olivia Tong ","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian","Hey, guys. So I wanted to focus on pricing for a minute. If we go back a year ago when price increases were first being implemented in the household products industry, I think at least from my perspective we heard a very confident tone from you guys more so than other companies and basically that you've earned pricing power with the increase in new product superiority at the consumer level.","If we fast forward to today, pricing has pretty much gone through almost across the board at most of your competitors and you guys had a couple of categories where you've had price gap issues in terms of both bags and wipes and a better response. So I'd just be curious to get a bit of postmortem on if anything has changed from your perspective in terms of the way you manage pricing what you sort of learned from those issues? And I guess specifically as you look at the price gaps is sort of managing the price gaps versus peers a greater priority given they appeared to be willing to use that pricing lever? Thanks.","Benno Dorer","Yes Dara. So like we said in our earlier remarks we feel good about pricing. It was cost justified is necessary to protect long-term margin also to protect the strong investments that we're making in our brands. All of them are in market now. And I would say generally in line with expectations excluding Glad and Kingsford, I would say. It's just too early.","The key indicators -- consumer indicators are strong. If I think about the consumer value measure and as you know that's a measure that we care about a lot, that's unchanged post pricing and the majority of our brands continue to be perceived by consumers as delivering superior value and that's very positive and important to us.","The categories have improved. Two years ago before we started any pricing activity our categories were flattish for the total company. Now if you think about the last 52 weeks they're up north of 2 points, up versus year ago. That's a dramatic difference and is very consistent with past experience and expectations.","So I would say excluding Glad inline with expectations, clearly the bumpiness that we had anticipated which leads generally to lower merchandising and distribution losses are there. We're seeing them. We're addressing them. But they're temporary.","But generally the good news is that pricing has been accepted, has been accepted as part of the industry where we perhaps somewhat disproportionately affected by distribution losses given that we went out with price increases as you recall Dara early and confidently. That's quite possible, but that doesn't change our conclusion that pricing overall was necessary and good.","Dara Mohsenian","Okay. That's helpful. And then looking at a bunch of your peers in the U.S. we've seen top line momentum come back to a number of names with reinvestment behind the business. It sounds like a lot of the European household products peers are also choosing to do some margin resets and reinvestments.","I guess just as we think about your business have you considered a larger reinvestment back into ad spend on what you've guided to this year? Why wouldn't that make sense here? I get that a lot of those companies don't directly compete against you. But there seem to be a number of players that are perceiving like higher spending is working to drive their business in the industry. So any thoughts there would be helpful? Thanks.","Benno Dorer","Yes Dara. We always consider how much money to spend and the -- about 10% continues to be the right number. Remember that's up already from previous years. Also the spending in absolute this year will be up and comes on the back of higher ROIs as measured by our own analytic insights. So we're confident with the 10% as the right level.","Dara Mohsenian","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse.","Kaumil Gajrawala","Thanks, good afternoon everybody. Two questions, I guess, first we've spoken quite a bit about distribution. Can you give us some context on what the impact was from distribution losses on your overall top line? And then when we're thinking -- as we're thinking about next year can you give some context on the impact of what generally seems to be lower commodity cost on your gross margins? Thanks.","Kevin Jacobsen","Thanks Kaumil. It's Kevin. I'll - let me take the two questions about commodities and distribution. On the commodity question in terms of the impact of the topline, I would tell you -- or excuse me distribution, we don't break that out. So I think we share the key drivers in terms of volume and price mix, but don't break out the impact to distribution loss.","What I would tell you on commodities in terms of our expectations, if you recall in fiscal year 2019 there's a pretty significant headwind both commodities and logistics about 150 basis points. As we look forward in fiscal year 2020 and our ingoing assumption to the year is a much milder commodity environment, I expect it to be down in the front half and up slightly in the back half, but pretty benign overall.","Having said that I do expect logistics to continue to be a headwind in fiscal year 2020, both transportation rates I anticipate will still be inflationary to a lesser degree than what we experienced in 2019, but still inflationary.","And then we continue to see inflation in logistics particularly in warehousing as we can use the warehouses being built to support fast delivery and that's putting pressure on wages. But overall, I would expect that somewhere in the 50 to 100 bp headwind which is much less that we experienced in 2019.","Kaumil Gajrawala","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","Excellent. Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in here and good afternoon to you. I want to drill a little bit deeper into two other businesses both the multipurpose liquid cleaners and bleach if we could. First, on bleach it's -- the data the measured data and tracked channels has softened of late with the private label picking up and your business spotting and share on axillary and distribution losses.","Can you give us any context of what you're seeing across all channels and what you think may be driving that? And then still on the topic of bleach, going back to 2013 the last compaction initiative -- and I'm really stretching my memory here. But if my memory does serve me correct, it created a lot of market share volatility for you I believe as private label was slow to follow and there was a perception a value perception. It was private label sitting next to you at much bigger bottles that really weighed on share and was volatile for performance for a while. A, is my memory correct there? And B, any reason it would be different this time?","Benno Dorer","Yes, in gust in general I'm quite pleased with Laundry. Laundry had a solid year Jason. And actually most recently if you think about our bleach business we gained share right? But typically what does happen is that share gains tend to over time be a little bit of a zero-sum game. And you win some and you lose some. And there's always volatility. But in general shares in the category have been over for long period of time about flat. And the value that we've been driving on this business comes from expansion of the category and from trade-up. And in the future, we don't expect to change from that strategy. Bleach Compaction feeds into that. Most of all what Bleach Compaction has always done is trade consumers up to larger sizes and with that comes a quite significant category increase.","So if you think about the benefit on -- of compaction for the company, the last time in 2013 it was actually higher sales mostly driven by category growth. And then second of course there's a margin component as well which at the time was rather significant. So given that there is a transition over for sure two quarters and of course we can't speak to competition following and what their specific timings are that always creates some volatility. But the net effect as a result of category increases and margin improvements has been very positive. And of course it's a good investment also for sustainability reasons and one that retailers are very excited about leads to better shelf holding power, fewer out-of-stocks in the category and this is a category that's always been somewhat affected by out-of-stocks. So it is a very good initiative that will create a lot of value for the company, but also for retailers and certainly for the planet.","Jason English","Okay. So long term generally good. But historically could be turbulent maybe turbulent this time around for a short duration before it gets better.","Benno Dorer","Yes. So turbulent is a strong word Jason. I don't know that I would go all the way there. Certainly there will be quarter-on-quarter volatility. But I do not recall any turbulence on the business and would not expect that.","Jason English","Okay. And on the liquid cleaners side which is a pretty chunky-sized business for you guys. Year two the Nielsen datas looked soft and I know it varies by cohort or which subsegment we look into it. But in general, there's been a fair amount of -- fairly sizable share losses that we can see on the tracked channel and also here too fairly sizable distribution declines. It looks problematic in the data but you're not talking about it. So is it indeed sort of problematic, or is it just the lens we're looking through?","Benno Dorer","It's always temporary back and forth. In Home Care generally we feel good about Home Care. There's many segments that are growing and there's always some that aren't growing. Home Care has a lot of different segments and you're picking one. We feel -- obviously it feels good about our Home Care business. It's our largest SBU, had a strong fiscal year 2019 had a strong quarter. Certainly, as a result of pricing you'll see some bumpiness there too which is temporary. But as I think about Home Care including multipurpose liquid cleaners, I feel good about that business and our plans forward.","Jason English","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy","Hey, good afternoon everyone. A couple for me. One on Kingsford and then I have a follow-up on bleach. So Benno, on Kingsford, you talked about getting into pellets and lump charcoal for some time. And naturally it would seem to make sense to extend the Kingsford brand in the category. But a few questions here. With the benefit of hindsight what do you think the company did not react earlier to the trend away from traditional Charcoal?","As you plan to extend the brand into these new forms what's your level of confidence in these new product forms that you'll indeed have success and be able to pick up some share? You talked Benno about the necessity to regain retailer confidence. How should we be thinking about that level of uncertainty here that's embedded in the outlook? And then at a higher level here how are you thinking about the growth rate for Kingsford longer term?","Benno Dorer","Yes. So, thanks Kevin. First of all, let me maybe start with the last question. So grilling fuels is an attractive category. It's very much on trend. And if you think about the category growth rates including those alternative grilling fuels like lump and pellets actually very strong strongly growing category, we're not benefiting from it. But historically we have and we have to get back to that. Would I have liked for us to be in pellets and lump by now? Absolutely.","But what we're focused on now is to get into these markets with propositions that are truly differentiated and that make a difference to the category and adds to the category and to the existing offerings. And admittedly that takes time and sometimes taking time leads to better outcomes. And while like I said I would like to be in there by now we're now focused on looking forward and putting better plans in place for calendar year 2020.","Like I said earlier, the problem is largely contained to two large customers. If we drill into say the top 10 customers, there are several customers where we're actually doing quite well. And we have plans that we put in place have been well-received and are working.","We got to do better with those two large customers. They are important customers for us. We have a strong track record of success with them and we have to get back to that.","Kevin Grundy","Okay. All right, thanks, Benno. I'll leave the Kingsford topic there. A quick follow-up, maybe this is for Kevin on bleach and the benefit of compaction. I don't know if you specified exactly the degree of compaction.","But you guys did disclose in the past that was 500 basis points of margin improvement. Do you care to put a number on, what the benefit will be to the Clorox Bleach business for this round of compaction? And then, I can pass it on. Thank you.","Kevin Jacobsen","Thanks, Kevin. Yeah, I would tell you. We're not disclosing the impact of bleach. What I would tell you, we feel very good about it in terms of creating long-term value to the company. This is another great program for us. But in terms of the specifics of the value, we won't disclose that.","Kevin Grundy","Okay. Thank you, guys. Good luck.","Kevin Jacobsen","Thanks, Kevin.","Lisah Burhan","We'll take one last question.","Operator","We have a question from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","Hi, guys. Thanks. I think I have a couple questions. One is, do you want to get a better sense of where the confidence is coming from, on the non-Kingsford, non-Glad businesses. And that the issues you've seen there won't spread?","And look I get that we always a tracked channels as less important. Tracked channel isn't that big as a business. We have also some other channels. But it's been even just recently a pretty good leading indicator of some of your issues, perhaps a little bit of a longer lag, but clearly its odd show -- the issue show up in Kingsford in the tracked channel data and Glad as well.","And so if you permit me to continue with that, lens, the tracked channels actually matter. One of the biggest indicator has been market share losses and I'm just looking at the data.","Again, it's a couple of months now. But cleaning broadly, to spray cleaners, to losing share, dressing looks like it's losing share its clearly white as you said, Cat Litter, digestive supplement. You know, I could go on. And those look like they're losing market share.","So I guess, I'm trying to get a sense of where your confidence comes, that you're not going to see a spread given the tracked channels remains -- some what a leading indicator at least that has been for the two businesses you had issues in so far Kingsford and Glad.","Benno Dorer","Yeah, thanks, Ali. So clearly tracked channels matter, because they account for the majority of the business, as it does market share, so that up front. With exception of this quarter, which again was overshadowed by Charcoal, I think we have commented in the past that, performance in non-tracked channels were stronger. We expect that to continue.","It's also fair to say, that our market share have been somewhat under pressure and not as strong as they used to be. I think that is evident. And while that's, not something that we like.","I'd also say that, what we expect about sales is to drive market share but also categories. So, we'd perhaps again go to a much stronger category, growth as a way to partially offset that.","And doing a time of pricing and the bumpiness that we talked about, distributional losses and then in some cases lack of sufficient merchandising, I would put market share softness, firmly in the camp of temporary bumpiness post pricing.","What makes me confident is that again if I think about the timing of trade spend on Brita aside that the three segments outside household are performing at minimum solidly with many, actually performing very strongly.","And then I think about our plans for fiscal year 2020 based on strong advertising sales promotion, aggressive plans to defend our businesses through trade were needed in selective areas, robust innovation plans, solid categories, a healthy U.S. consumer, an improving business in International, all those things point to a pretty stable and positive outlook that we expect to shine through in the back half.","Ali Dibadj","That's very helpful context. And just to push a little bit on that context. As we think about the first half versus back half, I don't like being so short-term oriented. But it does seem like if everything else is going okay and the confidence is still there and I get there's a little bit more Brita investments and you still got to do Kingsford and Glad, I get that.","But I guess I'm still confused about why, number one, it's so extremely, it sounds like back half loaded, i.e., I'm reading into Glad, Kingsford might get worse before they get better in the next -- in the first half.","And then two is, whether you're especially with the compaction that should help in the back half whether there's anything else that you're seeing that might actually be under pressure around the corner because with the confidence it would suggest maybe it should be better from a guidance perspective for 2020 than you've given us so far at least on the top line.","Kevin Jacobsen","Yeah Ali. This is Kevin. Maybe a couple of thoughts to think about front half, back half. As we've talked about the two businesses have been challenged. I would expect to see a sequential improvement from Glad. As we mentioned, we increased trade spending in Q4 and we start to see some improvements. We are increasing further to fully narrow that price gap back when it took pricing and I expect that to drive continuous improvement.","Coal I think is going to have a challenged finish to what we call season year 2019 as we've talked about the work we have to do looking forward to season year 2020. So I expect that to be challenged in Q1 and then be stronger in the back half.","And then maybe just a couple other things to think about is as we think about why we have confidence in the back half. Keep in mind, we're lapping a very weak cold and flu season from this year. We'll be lapping pricing at the back half of the year. The bulk of our pricing started early in 2019, so we'll be lapping most of that by the back half. The distribution losses as well will now won't be lapping. We're starting to build some of those back.","And then finally, our plans on innovation tend to be more back half-loaded. And so when we look at all those drivers, it gives us quite a bit of confidence on our ability to accelerate the performance of the company in the back half of the year.","Ali Dibadj","Okay, okay. I get the compares point certainly. Okay. Thanks very much.","Kevin Jacobsen","Thanks Ali.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Dorer, I would now like to turn the program over to you.","Benno Dorer","Yeah. Thank you all for joining us today and I look forward to seeing all of you hopefully at our Analyst Day in October.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Mr. Steve Austenfeld, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Mr. Austenfeld, you may begin.","Steve Austenfeld","Great. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining Clorox's first quarter Conference call. On the call with me today are Don Knauss, Clorox's Chairman and CEO; Benno Dorer, Clorox's CEO-elect; and Steve Robb, our Chief Financial Officer. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet, and a replay of the call will be available for 7 days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com","Let me remind you that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including, but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures, determined in accordance with GAAP, can be found in today\u2019s press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the Financial Results area of our website as well as in our filings with the SEC.

Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.","Turning to our prepared remarks. I'll cover highlights of our first quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our financial results and financial outlook for fiscal year '15. And finally, Don and Benno will close with their perspectives, followed by Q&A.","As we said in today's press release, results from Clorox Venezuela are now included in discontinued operations for both the current and year-ago quarters. All of our commentary today is on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise stated. For more detail on our past results from continuing operations, please see the additional schedules included in the press release we issued this morning.","So turning to our top line results. In Q1, volume was up 1%, and sales grew 1%, including the impact of unfavorable foreign currencies. On a currency-neutral basis, sales grew nearly 3%. Our growth reflects the benefit of price increases taken mostly in international markets and higher volume as well as a price increase on our Glad business taken earlier in the calendar year. These results were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currencies, primarily from Argentina as well as higher trade spending. Steve will provide more details on sales drivers in a moment.","In the first quarter, our U.S. 13-week market shares decreased 0.2 point versus the year-ago quarter, reflecting continued intense competitive activity in our Cat Litter and Brita businesses. The slight decline in the quarter was an improvement from the prior quarter, driven by solid market share gains in several categories, including Kingsford charcoal, Laundry and our Home Care business. This positive trend has continued as the latest data as of mid-October reflected our first total company share gain in more than a year.","Looking at our categories. They were up 0.5 point in the first quarter, a nice improvement versus the decline in the prior quarter. However, this still remains below historical category growth rates, and sustained category growth has been difficult to achieve. Continuing to invest to improve our category trends and market shares remains our top priority.","With that, I'll review our first quarter results by segment. In our Cleaning segment, Q1 volume decreased 1%, and sales were down 2% due to lower shipments of Home Care and Laundry products. In Home Care, which is our largest U.S. business unit, sales decreased modestly primarily due to a distribution loss of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes at a major club customer earlier this calendar year. At many other customers, wipes are performing very well.","In response to the intensely competitive environment on wipes, we've increased investments in 3D demand building, including increased consumer promotions, consumer communication across TV, radio and digital highlighting the value of Clorox Wipes versus competitors' products, high levels of quality merchandising and innovation with a number of new wipes products. In the last 2 quarters alone, we've launched 4 new variants of wipes, including those for glass, bathroom and heavy-duty cleaning as well as a larger-sized wipe. Clorox remains the clear leader in the wipes category with market shares remaining near 50% in tracked channels and with share trends improving. We're optimistic this trend will continue.","Looking ahead, in October, we've seen an uptick in sales of disinfecting products related to strong back-to-school execution and the start of the cold-and-flu season as well as recent concerns over enterovirus and Ebola. However, it's too soon to tell if this will have an ongoing impact on consumer use in the coming quarters. We are prepared to meet a potential increase in demand if needed. Don will talk more in a few minutes about consumer concerns regarding the spread of infection, including Ebola.","In our Laundry business, Clorox Bleach lost volume as it lapped 11% volume growth in the year-ago quarter due to the earlier introduction of our concentrated formula. From a market share standpoint, our investment in this brand and our focus on value are paying off as September marked the third consecutive quarter of market share growth on Clorox Bleach.","In our Household segment, we delivered 4 -- strong 4% volume growth and 5% sales growth. The segment's top line results were driven by strong performance in our Charcoal and Bags and Wraps businesses. The Charcoal business grew volume 16% due to promotions and consumption behind the Labor Day holiday and outstanding execution at retail. In Bags and Wraps, volume and sales were up behind solid category growth and incremental merchandising and distribution gains on Glad OdorShield trash bags, which delivered all-time record shipments behind great consumer acceptance of some of our new scents. These results were partially offset by lower shipments of Glad base trash bags behind a shift to premium trash bags.","Turning to Cat Litter. Volume was flat, and sales and share decreased as a result of continued intense competitive pressure. In response, we're investing more aggressively in innovation and on communicating our value proposition versus the competition, particularly focusing on excellent clumping and odor control. While it's only been recently launched, we are optimistic about the recent introduction of our Fresh Step Extreme lightweight products.","In our Lifestyle segment, volume was flat and sales decreased 1%. These results reflected lower shipments of Hidden Valley salad dressing and Brita products. In August, we started shipping an improved Brita filter that is faster and easier to change than competitive filters. We plan to continue introducing innovation that differentiates Brita from the competition, and we are optimistic that our Water Filtration business will return to growth in the second half of the fiscal year. Partially offsetting these decreases were double-digit volume and sales growth on Burt's Bees products, largely due to innovation in lip and face care products. In particular, our new lip crayons, new lip balm flavors, vanilla bean and wild cherry, and our face palette products were all very strong in the quarter.","Turning to International. Volume was up 5% behind solid market share performance, but sales were flat, reflecting unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, primarily in Argentina. On a currency-neutral basis, sales for International grew a strong 10%. While we expect modestly slower growth in some countries to continue, our market shares remain generally healthy across our international markets, and we're seeing improvement in most core countries and categories. With the exception of Argentina, we're continuing to invest in demand-building initiatives and innovation to support category growth.","Looking at the balance of fiscal year 2015, we remain committed to growing our categories and market shares through strong brand investment and clearly demonstrating the value that our products provide consumers across the 3 Ds. We continue to anticipate sales to be about flat or to grow in the range of 1% to 3% on a currency-neutral basis.","Now I'll turn it over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our Q1 performance and our outlook for fiscal year '15.","Stephen M. Robb","Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. Before I discuss our first quarter results, let me echo Steve's comments regarding our recast financials. Unless otherwise noted, all of my commentary today is for continuing operations, with the results of Clorox Venezuela now reclassified to discontinued operations in the current and year-ago quarters.","We're pleased to have started the year with a solid quarter. Sales came in a bit better than we expected due to stronger shipments of charcoal and slightly improved market share. This contributed to the company delivering diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.10 versus $1.05 in the year-ago quarter for an increase of 5%. In our first quarter, sales grew 1%, reflecting the benefit of nearly 2 points from pricing and more than 1 point of volume growth. This was offset by about 2 points of negative foreign currency impact, primarily from Argentina and nearly 1 point of higher trade promotion spending. On a currency-neutral basis, sales grew nearly 3%.","Gross margin for the quarter declined 70 basis points to 42.8% compared to 43.5% in the year-ago quarter. The biggest factors contributing to the gross margin decline were about 170 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs reflecting inflationary pressures internationally, particularly from Argentina, and higher trade spending. Commodity cost increases, primarily for resin, contributed another 40 basis points to the decline. Now although oil prices have declined recently, resin, our largest commodity purchase, continues to see higher prices due to tight supply. Partially offsetting these impacts were the benefits of about 120 basis points of cost savings and about 90 basis points of pricing.","Selling and administrative expense was lower in the first quarter at 13.3% of sales versus 14.4% of sales in the year-ago quarter. In the prior year quarter, the company made incremental investments to change IT service providers and to upgrade our Burt's Bees systems and processes. In the current quarter, cost savings and a onetime change in the company's long-term disability plan to make it more consistent with the marketplace also contributed to the lower selling and administrative expense.","Advertising and sales promotion came in at 9% of sales, reflecting continued strong support behind our brands. In addition, our U.S. Retail advertising was nearly 10% of sales. In total, demand-building investment, including trade and advertising expense, increased $16 million versus the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to increased merchandising behind Clorox Disinfecting Wipes and other disinfecting products and the litter business. Our effective tax rate of 33.7% was lower by about 0.5 point in the quarter versus year ago. Net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.10, a 5% increase versus the year-ago quarter.","Free cash flow for the quarter was $205 million or 15.2% of sales compared with $157 million in the year-ago quarter or about 11.7% of sales. The increase in free cash flow is primarily due to reduced employee incentive compensation payments, reflecting significantly lower year-over-year payouts and somewhat higher tax payments in the year-ago quarter. In fiscal '15, we continue to anticipate free cash flow as a percentage of sales to be about 10%.","Now we'll turn to our fiscal year 2015 outlook on a continuing operations basis. First, let me clarify the impact to our fiscal '15 outlook from reclassifying Venezuela to discontinued operations. From a sales standpoint, exiting Venezuela has only a small benefit to the sales outlook since current year sales were not expected to be significantly different than prior year sales. Our initial outlook had assumed significant and ongoing price increases would partially offset the impact of currency devaluations. We are, therefore, not changing our sales growth outlook. From a profit standpoint, our previous outlook had anticipated only a modest loss in Venezuela in fiscal '15 as anticipated price increases were expected to significantly reduce the loss. Therefore, reclassifying Clorox Venezuela to discontinued operations does not have a significant impact on our EPS outlook.","With that, let me provide details of our fiscal '15 continuing operations outlook. We continue to anticipate sales to be about flat as the benefits of innovation and pricing are expected to be offset by the continuing headwinds of category softness and about 2 points of negative foreign currency as the strong U.S. dollar is having a significant impact across most markets and in particular, in Argentina, where we continue to anticipate double-digit currency devaluations. On a currency-neutral basis, we continue to anticipate sales growth of 1% to 3% as previously communicated.","Turning to margin. We continue to anticipate gross margin to be up slightly for the fiscal year as the benefit of cost savings and pricing will be mostly offset by higher manufacturing and logistics costs as well as higher commodity costs, especially resin. In response, we are taking a 6% price increase on our Glad business in November, which is cost justified.","We continue to anticipate selling and administrative expense at about 14% of sales and advertising at about 9% of sales. We now anticipate EBIT margin will be about flat versus the prior year, a change versus the prior outlook which had assumed 25 to 50 basis points of expansion. This change in outlook is primarily due to somewhat higher resin prices and the reclassification of Venezuela to discontinued operations.","For perspective, exiting Venezuela and recasting the historical results improved our fiscal '14 EBIT margin from continuing operations by 60 basis points to 17.8% versus 17.2% previously reported. Our fiscal '15 tax rate is now assumed to be slightly more favorable than before, likely closer to 34% versus the prior outlook for 34% to 35%. Net of all of these factors, we continue to anticipate diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.50, with a slightly lower EBIT margin outlook to offset by the tax rate.","Looking forward, the U.S. environment remains intensely competitive, and we are committed to accelerating top line growth through product innovation and stepped-up investments in our demand-building programs. We will also continue to lean in harder on our strong cost savings programs and drive efficiencies to increase productivity.","And with that, I will turn it over to Don.","Donald R. Knauss","Okay. Thanks, Steve. Hello, everyone. Happy Halloween to everybody. I'm pleased to see the fiscal year is off to a really solid start in the midst of, as we all know, a tough environment out there, in part reflecting the benefits of a strong summer barbecue season, as both Steves talked about, on our Charcoal business. But I think it's also important to note that we're seeing improving market share trends in several categories, supported by increased demand-building investments and innovation. You certainly saw that in the first quarter.","A question being asked a lot lately is whether concerns over enterovirus and particularly, Ebola, have had a material impact on driving growth of disinfecting products. Well, in Q1, we obviously saw no real impact from Ebola, given that the Cleaning division was down 2% in sales as we noted earlier although we did see an impact on certain disinfecting products from stepped-up execution behind our typical back-to-school season and the start of the cold-and-flu season. In fact, if you look at the wipes category in the quarter, the wipes category was up 9%, and we were up a bit above that, gaining almost a share point.","Now in the most recent 4 weeks of MULO data, this is data ending October 19, we have seen a continued uptick in disinfecting product purchases related to those consumer concerns about the spread of infection. If you look at the Wipes category in that latest 4-week period, it's up in the mid-teens, and we're growing at a faster clip than that, continuing to gain share. So as -- at the same time, as Steve said, it's really much too soon to tell if those concerns are going to have an ongoing impact on consumer use and product consumption over the course of the coming quarters. We'll see how that plays out.","Certainly, offering solutions such as household disinfectants, like Clorox Regular-Bleach and Disinfecting Wipes, which meet the Centers for Disease Control's current criteria for use in hospitals, that aligns with our health and wellness strategy to help stop the spread of infection in general. So as part of our Stop the Spread of Infection campaign, we're always looking for ways to help educate consumers on how to best protect themselves and their loved ones against disease. So for example, information about enterovirus and Ebola have been posted on clorox.com, including the CDC's recommendation on disease prevention. In addition, we have posted a list of our disinfecting products that meet the criteria established by the CDC. So we think the consumer is well informed.","Also consistent with our values as a company and our long-standing practice of helping in times of crisis, we're working with governments and nongovernment organizations to meet critical needs in the U.S. and abroad. Just recently, we donated thousands of bottles of Clorox Bleach to West Africa, where bleach is obviously one of the most urgently needed supplies. Bleach is essential for disinfecting safety equipment and sanitizing health facilities, and we obviously believe our donations will help protect health workers, who play a pivotal role in containing that epidemic. We're also working with USAID to assess the ongoing needs in that region, and we stand ready to assist further as needed.","I think it's reasons like that have made me proud to have led this company for the past 8 years. And I've certainly appreciated speaking with all of you each quarter, I think today is actually my 33rd earnings call, and at various meetings and conferences around the country and around the world. I think you've always pushed our thinking, and you've made us better for that. And for that, we're all grateful.","I'm pleased to be staying on as Executive Chairman of the Board, and I couldn't be more pleased with the selection of Benno Dorer as the company's next CEO. I think many of you have met Benno over the years, so I know you're familiar with his experience and his strong strategic skills. Benno and I have worked closely together for the past 8 years that I've been here, and I can certainly testify that he's got a broad perspective and tremendous domestic and international experience here at Clorox and from his days at Procter & Gamble.","He's got a strong track record of achieving results and driving change and shares with me, I think, a very similar approach to leadership. While it is certainly no-nonsense, and we focus very much on execution, it's also based on a strong set of core values. And I think those values start with a focus on integrity and putting our people first, and I have every confidence he's going to be a great leader for Clorox.","And I think in addition to Benno, as you all know, we've got a terrific set of executive leaders from Steve Austenfeld, Steve Robb as CFO, Dawn Willoughby and Nick Vlahos as the new Co-Chief Operating Officers and the rest of the executive team. So I'm very pleased that all these changes have been done with internal candidates. We've got a very strong bench in this company. It's a great company, great people. It's been a privilege and an honor to have served them over the past 8 years.","And so with that, I'll turn it over to Benno, and we'll wrap it up and kick off the Q&A.","Benno Dorer","Hello, everyone, and thank you, Don. I very much appreciate your words, and I look forward to taking over the reins of the company next month. I'm deeply honored and excited.","As everyone on the call knows, Don has just done a tremendous job leading Clorox. During his tenure, he led the company through a successful Centennial Strategy and went on to lay the groundwork for the future by establishing the company's 2020 Strategy. He does leave big shoes to fill, and I'm excited to be working with the executive team and leaders across the company to build on the strategy Don has led over 8 years. Now with Don staying on as Executive Chairman, we'll be able to make this transition seamless for the Clorox organization and the benefit of all of our stakeholders. There is no better time to be CEO at Clorox. Our people are second to none, and I believe our focus on big-share brands in midsized categories, countries and channels is the right one for us.","As I've been sharing with folks in the past 6 weeks or so, this transition has a lot to do with continuity, no extreme right or left turns. I believe we're on the right path with the 2020 Strategy. At the same time, the defining issue for Clorox is accelerating profitable growth, so we're leaning into this strategy and accelerating the key elements that I believe drive the greatest value. First, we will increase our investment in demand-building programs to reinforce the value proposition of our brands, to reinvigorate our categories and to profitably grow market share. Now that means, first and foremost, creating values for consumers by delivering superior, innovative products that delight them and ensuring our communications make clear why our products are the ones to choose. Second, we will grow into profitable new categories and channels through innovation, partnerships and acquisitions. And third, we will remove waste in our work, products and supply chain to create organizational capacity and to fund growth.","Underpinning all of these will be a continued focus on our people. As CEO, my job is to keep Clorox people focused on our 2020 Strategy and empower them to deliver results in a way that's consistent with our values as a company. With strong plans in place for the current fiscal year and a 2020 Strategy that sets clear objectives and focuses everyone on value creation, I am very optimistic about the future and firmly believe we have what it takes to succeed. In the interim, of course, it's about hitting our fiscal year annual goals, which is why I'm pleased we're off to a solid start this fiscal year.","And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from John Faucher from JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess I want to talk a little bit about, there's a perception that the U.S., in general, is getting better. And if the consumer comes back, can you talk about where you stand from a marketing standpoint relative to peers, share of voice, et cetera, in order to be able to take advantage of that on a consistent basis? And then also want to follow up a little bit about sort of the pricing question. Don -- or you guys talked -- or Steve -- I'm not sure which one talked about sort of the pressure in the resin market. Is that something that you're going to be able to pass through to consumers? And do you need the consumer to be a little bit stronger in order to absorb some of that pricing?","Donald R. Knauss","Yes. John, I think in terms of the U.S., clearly, the slight uptick we saw in the categories in the quarter with the 0.5 growth rate that Steve mentioned is certainly an improvement sequentially over where we saw the prior quarter. And looking at the University of Michigan's consumer confidence index this morning, which came out in pretty good shape, I do think the consumer in this country is becoming a little less cautious. Now having said that, we still have 1\/3 of the households in this country making less than $35,000 a year. So and those wages are stagnant. So we're cautious about this. I think that's one of the reasons we're committing to spending more in marketing dollars to support the brands in the coming months. So you -- as you look at this quarter, for example, you saw about a 5% increase in our demand spending. I think that will be fairly consistent throughout the year. A lot of that spending is supporting innovation like Fresh Step lightweight litter. It's supporting increased merchandising behind disinfecting products as we go into the flu -- cold-and-flu season. So all in all, I think you'll see that increase in spending, John, continue to support the innovation we've got. We've got another wave coming out in January with brand news across most of the major brands. So I think we'll be in a good position to capitalize on that as the consumer improves. It was also interesting to note that when you think about the low-income households in this country, you're going to see more innovation from us on what we're calling LOOP products, low out of pocket. For example, we're just launching a $0.99 Clorox Bleach product that will particularly, probably most likely, show up heavily in the dollar channel. So we think the innovation, the focus on LOOP products and the increased spending behind that innovation should put us in a pretty good place.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And if I could -- Don, I guess, if I could just follow up. More spending, do you think -- are you spending enough after you get these adjustments relative to some of the declines we've seen in brand support over the past couple years? So I appreciate that you're spending more. Is it back up to the level you need for the right level of share of voice?","Donald R. Knauss","Yes. I think so, John. If you look at the spending in the U.S., for example, this quarter, we were at nearly 10% in advertising and consumer promotion. So I think that we're -- and we're going to try and continue to push the envelope on that. I think -- and when we look at the categories where we face off with private label on bleach, charcoal and trash bags, we virtually have -- we have 100% share of voice in bleach. We have 100% share voice in charcoal. And we've got near branded share of voice of 100% in trash. So I think we're in a pretty good place.","Stephen M. Robb","John, this is Steve. Let me weigh in on your second question, which has to do with resin prices. It's interesting, as we've all seen, energy prices have really traded off pretty sharply over the last couple of months, but the resin market has actually been climbing steadily higher. It's pretty tight supply-demand balance right now. As a result of that, we have announced, effective in November, we are taking a 6% increase on our Glad business. What we typically see when we do this is you can see volume be somewhat depressed for a couple of quarters, sometimes 2 to 4 quarters, which is pretty normal, but then the consumer tends to come back. And again, Glad is a category that as resin prices move up, we tend to take pricing. It's cost justified. Takes time but the consumer adapts to it, and competitors have historically followed pretty quickly on that. So we think it's a right decision to protect our margins, and we think it'll be fine with the consumer over time.","Donald R. Knauss","Well, I think what's interesting, John, if you look at the data in the quarter, if you look at trash, the category was up almost 4.5%, and our share traded off about 0.4 share point. If you look at the September data, the category was up 5%, and we were up in shares 0.3 share point. So it seems like, if that's that same pattern playing out, that after a few months of absorption, consumers will come back, and that's what we're seeing in the data.","Operator","And next, we'll take a question from Steve Powers from UBS.","Stephen Powers - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes. So you've mentioned the category acceleration in the quarter, better share trends, new innovation, and all that signals a basis for optimism on the top line, I think. And then on the bottom line, the exit from Venezuela, the $0.05 disability plan benefit this quarter should help as well. So just given all that, just trying to understand the maintenance of your full year guidance. Is that just more conservatism early in the year? Or are there things on the horizon that are offsetting some of those more positive trends so far?","Stephen M. Robb","Well, I think, as you say, we're certainly off to a good start on the year, and we feel very good about the plans we have in fiscal '15 and how we're executing against it. But I think it's important to note we're 90 days into this year, and we are going to have to continue to watch what happens with foreign currencies, commodity costs and how the consumer holds up as we go through the holiday season and get into the back half of this fiscal year. So I think we need more time to see how some of these things unfold as we move through the year. But at this point, we certainly feel like we're off to a good start and feel very good about the outlook that we have out there.","Stephen Powers - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then separate question on Venezuela, if I could. As you think about that exit, is that, at this point, a fairly cut-and-dry exercise, meaning that you have a clear blueprint to follow and that you've got line of sight to the end point? Or are there key unknowns, risks that we should be aware of that might alter the expected P&L impacts or cash cost over the course of that exercise?","Stephen M. Robb","Yes. And as you saw in our press release, and I guess I would echo, we continue to believe that the after-tax cost of the exit will be about $70 million to $80 million. Now a large portion of that will fall in fiscal '15. Some of that will obviously continue onwards. But I would say we have a plan. We've executed the plan, I think, very well. But it's obviously a tough situation, and there are unknowns. So I think we're going to need to continue executing the plan that we have and moving through it. But at this point, we think the after-tax cost of $70 million to $80 million and the cash cost on an after-tax basis of $5 million to $10 million, these numbers feel right to us.","Donald R. Knauss","I think that the after-tax cost is something to really focus on, in the $5 million to $10 million range. I think that as you look at FY '16 and '17, we expect very minimal impact from that. We're in the process now, we have been in an expedited sales process on the assets in Venezuela. We'll see how that plays out over the next coming weeks.","Operator","And next, we'll take a question from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You talked earlier about improving U.S. macros and how they're looking a touch better. But I'm just kind of curious, how much do you think your improved performance is a function of better macros and people's willingness to trade up perhaps versus the business-building initiatives that you guys have done?","Donald R. Knauss","It's interesting, there was a survey out this morning, Olivia, from the -- that said we were the only large company not to go down in consumer satisfaction in the last year. I think our focus on 60-40 blind wins, superior products, I think, and the in-store execution that we're seeing around assortment, merchandising, pricing and shelving is really paying off. So I think the fact that we're starting to see share gains for the first time in a year as a total company, and October certainly looks to be the same trend as September in that regard, I would say that says that a lot of this is due to the team's execution in the field and the strategy and focus across the 3 Ds. So I'm pretty bullish when I look at the rest of the year, given the next wave of innovation coming in January and the superior execution I've seen in the first quarter. And again, if you look at the overlaps into the second half of the year, I mean, we were negative 2% in sales. We were positive in the first half, which is what we're lapping now. So as you look at all those factors, really good innovation, increased brand support spending levels, really good execution in store and a bit of easier overlaps as we get into the back half, I think a lot of it's due to this team's effort rather than any -- certainly, having some tailwinds helps, but we'll always prefer to swim with the current than against it.","Benno Dorer","And Olivia, this is Benno. I'd also be cautious to call it a trend just yet. I think we've had quarters in the past where we've seen improvement, and then that was followed by a disappointment. So I'd love to wait another quarter or 2 until we call it a trend. I'm still cautious about this, and we're still focusing on what we can control, which is predominantly emphasizing the value of our brands, increasing our investments to drive market share and making sure that we execute our innovation with excellence. So I share the optimism, but I'd also say we want to remain cautious as far as the consumer is concerned. It remains a very challenging environment.","Donald R. Knauss","Yes. I think as Steve said and Benno said, I think we've got a quarter under our belts. There are headwinds out there in terms of currency and certainly, commodities, to some extent. So we're cautiously optimistic is probably the best way to put it.","Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. Understood. Maybe to follow up, in Household, that was -- that certainly beat my expectations. So I'm just kind of curious what you think about the sustainability of those gains. Clearly, new distribution in Bags and Wraps probably means at least 3 more quarters of benefit, but what about Charcoal? Was that a surprise to you that -- how strong Charcoal was?","Donald R. Knauss","We had very strong execution, and especially in our top 5 customers, and 2 of those top 5 are not in the syndicated data, which is Home Depot and Lowe's. So that's why the share was flattish. But when you look at the performance, as Steve said, we were up 16% in volume in the quarter. So I think that as we look forward, we're going to continue to focus on that level of execution going forward. I think we've got -- last couple years, we've got a really good game plan in place on Charcoal. And if you look at the innovation on Litter, we're cautiously optimistic, too, about Litter trends improving as we get into the next quarter and the back half of the fiscal year. And of course, Glad, we'll see how we play out in the next -- with this next price increase. But if you look at Glad in the quarter, I mean, Glad's volume was up almost 2%. And so -- and as I said, we're starting to gain a little bit of share back in September. So Charcoal was a driver, but we've got the game plan in place on how to drive that brand.","Steve Austenfeld","Olivia, just as a reminder, as Don pointed out, Charcoal is performing quite well right now, but we are moving into the smallest quarter of the year just due to seasonality and even the winter season. So even if it continues to perform well, at least for the next quarter or so, it won't have the same sort of impact it had in Q2 -- or in Q1, I should say.","Operator","And next, we'll take a question from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Benno, congratulations on the new assignment, and Don, congrats on retirement.","Donald R. Knauss","Thank you, Jason.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I'm sure you'll stay busy. So I wanted to drill down a little bit more on the cost outlook. You're talking about elevated resin prices now. I guess the trade's talking about some of these poly reactors coming back online soon and the potential for some loosening. As you mentioned, some of the feedstock is quite down. It appears that resin markets are poised to roll over. So I guess, first, would love to get your thoughts on that. And then secondly, what does it mean for your pricing? I know, looking back in time, October '08, you took prices on Glad trash bags up 10%. 2 months later, in December, you had to roll them back, and then there were a number of rollbacks that followed that. Why would this time be different if we get the relief?","Stephen M. Robb","Well, let me start off talking a little bit about the resin market. In the -- it's a tough situation because, to your point, feedstock prices are down pretty significantly. But at the same time, we've really got a situation where supply remains fairly tight, demand remains fairly solid, and when you bring it together, it translates into rising prices. And it's certainly what we anticipated coming into the year, but we recently saw another several penny move upward in resin prices that certainly looks like it's sticking in the marketplace. So our expectation is that prices are moving up, that they're likely to stay elevated. You could see some up and down over time, but these markets have tended to float up, level off for a period of time and then go to new highs. So that's really what we're planning for. As it relates to the pricing that we've taken on Glad, again, this is a category that tends to follow what happens with resin prices. So as prices go up, we try to price to the long-term average cost in resin. If, by some chance, resin prices go back down, you might have to step up the merchandising spend at that point. But at this point, we think prices are up. They're likely to stay elevated, and we're taking pricing accordingly.","Operator","Our next question will come from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Don, we are going to miss you. You've done a great job here, and Benno we look to, certainly, hearing more from you.","Donald R. Knauss","Thanks, Ali.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I had a couple questions about Venezuela first. So if I look at the kind of supplement table where you break out and restate the adjusted with the kind of $17 million shift to the losses from discontinued section, does -- so just from a clarification perspective, does that include the devaluation or not? Because I thought the devaluation was about $0.13, that ends up being $0.13. And if it does, I guess I want to ask -- or even if it does or doesn't, I want to ask your thought process in getting out of Venezuela. You clearly are the first ones to do it. You have been ahead of your peers on Venezuela. So I want to get a better sense of how you think about it, what you thought tomorrow was going to look like in Venezuela, in terms of the $70 million hit today and the $70 million charge to get out of it. And then if you can parlay that also to what your vision is for Argentina, given you guys, again, have been ahead on the Venezuela story here.","Donald R. Knauss","Yes. Let me start, Ali, with the thought process on Venezuela, and I'll let Steve jump in on the question you had on the chart. The thought process was, we have been under price controls for 3 years in Venezuela. And as you know, we believe that we may have been uniquely disadvantaged in the fact that about 70% of our portfolio was under price control. And of course, over that 3-year period, absorbing over 100%, in some cases, 200%, inflation cumulatively over that period of time took our gross margins from about -- in the high 30s to 40%, which was fairly consistent with U.S. gross margins. It was not materially different, and it was one of -- it was certainly a competitive gross margin for us, down into negative gross margin territory most recently. We had 29 meetings with the government between July of 2012 and July of 2014 explaining the predicament we were in and the real need for pricing in that market to be able to create a sustainable business. And of course, last year ended with $77 million of revenue and a $23 million operating loss. Although we had a more modest loss built into the margin -- or into the budget for this year, the pricing that we had been promised in June was delayed by 3 months. Each month was really another hit to the P&L, and of course, the pricing that was actually delivered in September was significantly below what we were promised. We saw no hope that we could create a sustaining business in that country. And given the issues -- the other macro issues they were dealing with, including the price of oil dropping, we didn't see any sustainable model for continuing to operate in that market, and that's what drove the decision. So over a 2-year period, after 29 meetings, it was time to make a call, and it was clearly in our shareholders' best interest to exit. And that was the thought process.","Stephen M. Robb","And Ali, this is Steve. Let me address at least a portion of your question regarding Venezuela financials. All of the activity of Venezuela in the quarter has been reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations. So that would include things like the operating losses in Venezuela for the quarter, which were about $6 million; asset charges associated with inventory, property, plant and equipment; as well as certain exit costs, including severance and recognition of foreign currency translation losses. This is one where it's pretty technical and detailed. I think we've got some good schedules in the web attachments to help you with this, and we also have a 10-Q coming out early next week that really details this. But happy to take your call offline if you'd like us to step you through more of the details on this.","Benno Dorer","And then you asked about Argentina. First of all, I'd say Argentina is not Venezuela. First of all, we actually made a profit in fiscal year '14. And the country -- our performance in the country was actually better than we expected, in part because we are getting pricing from the government and also the fundamentals in the country are better, which includes the fact that the middle class consist of about 40% of the population versus only about 10% in Venezuela. And keep in mind that Argentina, historically, if you look at the last 40 to 50 years, is moving at about 10-year cycles economically, and right now, we're near, even though -- probably not at the bottom but near the bottom of that cycle. So what we're focused on in Argentina is executing what we can control with excellence. That includes a strong focus on cost savings. That includes offsetting, as best as we can, inflation through pricing, and that includes margin-accretive innovation. Said that all, I will say that we're closely monitoring the situation in Argentina, and we fully expect the situation to remain challenging for a while.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. Can I ask 1 question which has 3 kind of quick hits on different categories? One is on Glad trash shifting to more premium. I guess I would have expected more of a pricing increase. You mentioned price, but I don't know if that includes price mix. I would have expected more of price mix kind of increase as you go into ForceFlex or what have you versus the traditional Glad trash there. More details, if you can, on Hidden Valley. It seems that some shelf space has been lost, I guess, when we do our in-store checks. Want to get your perspective on that, whether that's just a short-term thing or just misread. And then third is if you play forward on Glad on the price increases based on the oil price -- based on the commodity price from the resins perspective, historically, that has come from oil prices, over time, and certainly, you start seeing an impact maybe 4 or 5 months later from oil into the supply chain for resins. Is that contemplated? Or is it a different situation this time?","Stephen M. Robb","Ali, let me start with your last question first. As it relates to resin prices, here in North America, those resin prices are actually more closely aligned with natural gas ethylene, ethane. They're not directly tied to oil prices. Now oil prices can obviously influence the global market for resin pricing, and we're obviously working in global markets. But from a feedstock standpoint, oil can go down, and it's quite possible that resin prices can go up. The biggest factor driving resin prices up right now is something we've been talking about for quite some time, which is supply and demand. And I think the good news is, as you look out over the long term, several years from now, there is new capacity being built here in the U.S. that'll bring new supply to the market. But that's several years out, and therefore, as we look forward into the market, we think the supply-demand situation is going to remain fairly tight. That's likely to put some upward pressure on the floor underneath resin pricing.","Donald R. Knauss","Yes. Ali, as far as your question on Hidden Valley and the other brands, on Hidden Valley, we've seen no distribution losses in terms of shelving. We have seen some of the larger customers cut back on inventories, which is a short-term blip before merchandising -- as merchandising comes out of the summer. So there's nothing structural there at all. In fact, if you look at shares of Hidden Valley salad dressing in September, for example, it was basically flat. The category is down about 0.5 point. I think we were down 0.1 point, so basically flat. We've got some innovation on Hidden Valley, like premium dry dips, so the brand's as healthy as ever. So we've seen nothing in terms of any structural change to shelf spacing -- to shelf space. As far as Glad goes, we've got about 70% of that brand now is in premium trash. I think the falloff in the base trash has dragged down a little bit on the pricing. But that mix, as we go through the balance of the year, should continue to improve, and we'll see with this latest price increase, what that does to pricing on the brand in general.","Operator","Our next question will come from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First of all, congratulations to both of you. So on the promo spend line, I think you said you had $16 million of incremental strategic spending in the quarter. Is the right way to read that is advertising was up, like, $1 million and the other $15 million was higher contra-sales promotions?","Stephen M. Robb","Yes, that's the way to look at it, Bill. And when you look at that $15 million, it was basically in merchandising support behind innovation and cold and flu.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, got you. All right. Because the pricing was still pretty healthy, and I would have thought that, that spend would come out against...","Stephen M. Robb","Yes. It was more couponing, merchandising display support, those kinds of things. So it wasn't TFIs, if you will, so much in terms of temporary price -- temporary fund increases for price reductions on shelf.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, got you. And then on the Charcoal side, like, the growth was obviously pretty extraordinary. Is there anything one-off that we should be mindful as we model the first quarter of next year? Is there like a big promotion, like a fence thing at Costco or whatever that might not get repeated?","Donald R. Knauss","It's hard to know. I think, again, at the end of the day, we had really good plans that we put in place. We executed them extremely well, and the weather was good. And when you bring it all together, it turned out to be a very nice quarter for the Charcoal business. I think, again, over the long term, we feel good about the plans to grow that business. But obviously, lapping double-digit growth is going to be challenging as we get into the first quarter of next year.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just lastly, on the professional business, we didn't talk much about it on the call. There hasn't been deal activity there in a while. Is it just because it's taken a while to find the right assets? Are you guys kind of putting that on hold? Or kind of what's driving that?","Donald R. Knauss","I'm sorry, Bill, I didn't hear the first part of your question.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I'm just talking about professional. We didn't really hear a lot about it on the call, and there hasn't been a lot of deal activity there from you guys. And I know it's a pretty clear strategic priority, so I was just wondering why we haven't seen more on that front.","Donald R. Knauss","Yes. I think we're still -- recall that when we had the analyst meeting a couple of years ago, we've talked about the 3 legs of our stool: U.S. Retail, PPD and International. PPD we said would grow in the 10% to 15% range. We don't see that changing, Bill. It grew at a -- in a single-digit rate this quarter, but we had some challenges with a claim on one of our products that we've reinstated. And so we see that business continuing to grow at the double-digit rate going forward, so I don't think there's any issue there. As far as M&A goes, that's one of our primary focus areas, obviously, is M&A in that space, bolt-on M&A, that is. So we'll see what happens there. But nothing really changing in terms of what our expectations are for that business. And clearly, as you look at the retail trends in October around stopping the spread of infection, we're seeing that same thing translate into health care facilities as well.","Benno Dorer","And then Bill, if you -- again, our ambition for the professional business going forward is to grow it in the 10% to 15% range, and that continues to be a mix of organic and M&A. So while it's always tougher to plan for obvious reasons, as Don said, we continue to be focused on finding the right M&A partners for that business. But we'll also stay disciplined, and we'll want to be focused on finding the right opportunities at the right time.","Operator","And next, we'll take a question from Wells Fargo, Chris Ferrara.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Guys, can you talk a little bit about, I guess, your thoughts early on in the process of the disinfecting products picking up? Like, wipes were good, you cited that, into October. They were decent in September, right? So how do you think about how much of that is consumer pantry loading versus what's actually coming through? And again, I know it's early on, right, but you've seen this sort of stuff before, right? We've had other instances of this, right? So is it your sense that pantries are being loaded? Or do you think this stuff is actually being used? And then also, are retailers now -- are you thinking you're going to see more sell-in in anticipation of consumers picking up?","Benno Dorer","Well, like you said, it's really too early to say. So we're pleased with the incremental activities we've got in merchandising as a result of our planning, which was mostly around back-to-school and mostly around the flu season, and we've certainly seen an uptick. But historically, we have seen seasons where that has led to incremental consumption and also incremental household penetration. Keeping in mind that household penetration in this category is still only at about 50%, and there's ways to go. But we've also seen other seasons where it's led to a trough in the periods post the flu season. So I would say it's really, really too early to say. We are seeing an uptick in merchandising and an uptick in initial sales, but I would say it's too early to say.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it. That helps. And I guess, on the guidance, the EBIT margin number obviously is coming down. I think I understood you guys right, but are you basically saying that because Venezuela -- the reclass of Venezuela is what's driving that margin target down, in other words, the pricing you're expecting in Venezuela is why you had thought EBIT margin would have been up 25 to 50? Is that -- am I getting that right?","Stephen M. Robb","Yes. It's -- so first of all, and this is important, the absolute EBIT margin in fiscal '14, as a starting point, is 60 basis points higher. So we're starting from a higher place. All we're saying is that for fiscal '15, we think EBIT margin will be about flat, could be a little above or a little below that, but we think it's about flat. And the reason for that is because some of the expected EBIT margin improvement that we were counting on was coming from improving Venezuela, and we're actually going to get that. We're just getting it a different way. We're getting it because we've decided to exit the business. We've also had a bit more pressure in resin than we had anticipated. All of that said, as we look to the longer term, I think we continue to feel very good about the cost savings program, the pricing actions we're taking, the tight controls we have in place on SG&A. All of that gives us pretty good confidence that we'll continue to see good, solid EBIT margin expansion of 25 to 50 bps over the long term.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes, that's great. And then just real quick. I don't know if you said it, but the disability help or the $0.05 in benefit, where did that -- did that flow through COGS and SG&A? Or was that in other?","Stephen M. Robb","Yes, your accounting is really good. It flows through both, as a matter of fact. Some of that floated to SG&A, some of it floated to COGS. You did notice that our SG&A cost as a percentage of sales came in lower than the year ago. Part of that was because of the cost savings programs that we were driving in the company, and then a portion of that's just this onetime accrual adjustment that we needed to make in the quarter.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about International volume trends. It's just been so long, given the pressure from Venezuela, that we've seen kind of a \"clean number.\" So would you say that this kind of mid-single-digit pace is something you see as sustainable and really what's been underlying the reported trends for a while now or not really?","Benno Dorer","Yes. So Lauren, our stated goal as far as sales is concerned for International is 5% to 7% in year-on-year sales growth, and that remains our goal. And I'm -- we're seeing some slowdown, particularly in the faster-growing LatAm markets. Said that, it's important to remember that the absolute growth in those markets is still faster than in North America, and these are still attractive and profitable areas to invest. So I would say no change to our ambitions. What we are focused on is shifting the investment within International from less profitable and more stable markets into those faster-growing markets, like Chile, Peru and Colombia, and we're focused on improving our 3D plan execution to drive market share. And I'm pretty pleased with the progress, but we can do more. I also think that this is a good time to remind ourselves that, really, what we want to do in International is to improve the profitability of the growth in those markets as a primary objective, and we're doing that through cost savings. We're doing that by reaping the benefits of the SAP implementation in Latin America, through pricing and through margin-accretive innovation. So really no change to innovation, 5% to 7% sales growth, but more profitably to reverse the margin decline that we've seen as a result of onetimers as well as inflationary trends in International.","Donald R. Knauss","I think, Lauren, just to build on Benno's comments, I think where we have really focused our investment, and you look at the countries we've talked about in the past, Peru, Colombia, Mexico, to some extent, all those countries in the quarter had high single-digit volume growth, which is pretty encouraging from our standpoint. Even Argentina had low single-digit volume growth, there was still volume growth, which we felt very good about. So where -- those countries where we have invested resources, we're seeing those pretty good trends continue.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And then just another follow-up on the -- both professional products and Ebola concerns. Nothing to sneeze at in terms of your aspirations and growth rates you've been getting in professional. But I would think that with bleach being, and many of your products, CDC approved for fighting Ebola, there would be an enormous sales opportunity around this concern to get doors to open you've had trouble getting into before for whatever reason. Is that something you're trying to push harder with your sales force on right now?","Donald R. Knauss","Well, I think we're always very careful, Lauren, about trying to take advantage of some public health scare for people. So we're trying to be very mindful of that. I would say this, that bleach, which is the most effective and cheapest disinfectant in general has had -- there are some barriers with hospital usage and acute care facility usage, given the odor, if you work around it all day. There's residue. I mean, bleach is basically saltwater, right, with an electric charge to it. So if you wiped out a black toilet in a hospital, there's a little salt residue that you have to go back and clean up. What we're seeing from hospitals now is some of those concerns around odor and some -- a little bit of residue, those pale in comparison to the concerns about stopping the spread of infection. So I think to your point, bleach has always been acceptable, but it's probably becoming more acceptable in this environment that this is the thing that is the most effective against most bacteria and viruses out there. So clearly, as I said, the step-up we're seeing in the wipes category in October is not unlike the step-up we're seeing in professional and acute care facilities either.","Operator","Our next question will come from Erin Lash with Morningstar Investing Company.","Erin Swanson Lash - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered, but I wanted to follow up on the uptick or the pressure from manufacturing and logistics costs in the quarter. We've heard from a few other consumer product companies that the driver shortage is weighing on their cost of delivery, and I was wondering if that's what your increase in costs was related to and if it wasn't, what that kind of reflects.","Stephen M. Robb","I think that's right. I think it's several things. It's driver shortage, and just the shortage of trucks, in general, I think, is putting a bit of upward pressure. Wage inflation, obviously, is contributing somewhat. And then even on rail, I think rail costs are starting to go up. You've got more oil moving on rail as opposed to other forms of transportation, and that's kind of crowding things out. So I don't think it's any 1 thing. I think it's a collection of things. We've certainly seen the pressure, and we would anticipate that, that pressure's going to continue for some time.","Donald R. Knauss","I wouldn't -- Erin, it's interesting, I wouldn't say there's necessarily a numerical shortage of drivers as much as the new federal regulations around limiting drivers to 8 hours versus 12 hours, obviously, cuts down the capacity that an individual driver can have. And that's what's really fueling part of this, no pun intended.","Operator","And next, we'll take a next question from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","A couple of questions on -- very category specific, on wipes. I understand that the category overall has picked up. When you see the data though, and we haven't seen that October data that you are referring to, we still see very strong growth of private label and growing double digits, lapping huge growth from last year. And now private label and Reckitt have essentially 50% share. So to what extent do you feel that the category -- the pricing architecture of the category is safe given the growth of private label? And secondly, on Cat Litter, if you can explain us in terms of what is lacking on the innovation or marketing side or pricing side on your end that Nestl\u00e9 and Church are doing so much better on the pet litter category.","Donald R. Knauss","Yes. Javier, let me take wipes, and I'll turn it over to the Benno on litter. On wipes, we feel very good about the pricing we're getting in the market. Of course, wipes is one of those products where we didn't really take pricing for 14 years, so the architecture in that category has been fairly -- very -- in fact, very stable and consistent. If you look at the share data, over the last 4 months, we've seen very positive share gains for us. If you take our share, which is almost back to a 50%, we're equal to the private label and our branded competitor combined. So we feel very good with our trends in that category and our pricing and our margin structure in that category. So with the innovation we've got rolling out, as Steve noted, we've got 4 different new wipe formats out there, we feel very good about how that category is performing. It's kind of promises made, promises kept. We told all of you we thought we'd see those share gains coming back, and that's what's happening.","Benno Dorer","And then, Javier, on litter, first of all, Litter is a business we believe we have the right to win and certainly also has attractive tailwinds from a consumer standpoint. And I believe and the right to win is certainly grounded in the fact that we think we have a superior product that controls odor better than the competition. I think it's fair to say that over the last few months, we've been somewhat under pressure because the execution in that category on our side wasn't where we wanted to be, but we're moving fast to correct that and putting plans in place to reverse the share trends. And while we don't expect that to happen overnight, it'll take a few quarters, we're optimistic that we will be able to grow share in that business within a few quarters. And the plans that we're putting in place starts with new advertising that's squarely focused on demonstrating why our product delivers superior value to consumers. It includes an investment, and Don spoke to this earlier, in the right merchandising frequency, and we're starting to see some of that. And then finally, a real step up in innovation programs, which includes, of course, the lightweight litter, which is out there right now and really off to a nice start. And in some ways, this program follows the program and the model that we started to implement on bleach and on Disinfecting Wipes a few quarters ago, where we're now seeing a return to share growth. Our ambition certainly is, on litter, to drive the same results. So a business where we think we have the right to win, where we're putting improved plans in place and where we are cautiously optimistic that we will see a reversal of the share trends in the near future.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","And a follow-up on laundry additives like bleach and that kind of product. During the price war or at least the price promotions that Procter ran in July and August, we saw a lot of, I don't know whether it's retailer sponsor or if there was communication between you and Sun Products, but there was a lot of co-merchandising of Clorox products and Sun detergents. Is this something that you guys conducted? Is it something that is going to continue? What shall we read in terms of if this is some sort of strategic alliance that you are getting? If you can comment on that, it will be helpful.","Benno Dorer","Yes. So on bleach, this is something that we've been focused on. If you think about the category, anytime a retailer is able to sell more than 1 product in the category, meaning a bleach or a laundry additive along with a detergent, that leads to an increased dollar ring for the retailer and is, of course, valuable. And we've been driving that strategy with our retailers, including partners like Sun for a while now, and we're seeing good success behind that. So to answer your question, that is strategic, and it's intentional. And it's something that you should expect to continue to show up in the marketplace.","Operator","And that question will come from Connie Maneaty from BMO Capital Markets.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets Canada","I was interested in the comment that you made about 1\/3 of households making less than $35,000 a year. I'm wondering if you know what percentage of that big population is a core Clorox consumer and if you are adequately reaching them or if -- and if not, how big do you think this LOOP program can become? How many categories can it spread to?","Donald R. Knauss","Yes. Connie, it's interesting, our market share of cleaning products with that low-income consumer is almost identical to our market share in the general population. Now the risk is that, that share erodes and is more fragile than our share with the general population. And that's one of the reasons why we're so focused on these LOOP products, which I think can cover a number of different categories that we compete in. We're focused, first, on cleaning. But clearly, when you think about trash bags or you think about Hidden Valley or you think about any of our brands, there's a way to get a lower out-of-pocket price point on the shelf by adjusting package size. So that -- the good news is that people in that low-income group want brands. They want premium brands, and they also tend to buy premium brands around the first of the month when the pay period hits. So we're also trying not only to influence our packages and our -- the size of -- or to get to the right price point, but also tie our merchandising support in those channels to the first part of the month so we can capitalize and help them get access to our products when they have the money to afford them.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Did the LOOP -- is it just a change of packaging? Or is it also a change of formulation? Because it would seem to me that you'd already been serving the dollar stores pretty well. So what's the difference between...","Donald R. Knauss","Yes. It's more of a change in packaging size. So for example, on Clorox Bleach, it's identical to the product we put in the 64, the king size, it's just in a smaller package, whether it's 16-ounce or a quart-sized type package. So we don't want to do anything that would jeopardize -- or put a cheaper product in. Now there are other brands that we've launched, like Fraganzia, that have a different formulation that are targeted, for example, to a lower-income consumer that would be the same product. So regardless of what package size we'd be in, we would not do anything to cheapen the product from the core sizes.","Benno Dorer","So thanks, everyone, for joining us on today's call, and we look forward to speaking with you again when we share our second quarter results.","Operator","This concludes our conference for today.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. And I would now like to turn -- introduce your host for today's conference call, Mr. Steve Austenfeld, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Mr. Austenfeld, you may begin your conference.","Steve Austenfeld","Great. Thank you. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining Clorox's Fourth Quarter Conference Call. On the call with me today are Don Knauss, Clorox's Chairman and CEO; and Steve Robb, our Chief Financial Officer. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet, and a replay of the call will be available for 7 days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com.","Let me remind you that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures including, but not limited to, free cash flow, EBITDA margin, EBIT margin, debt-to-EBITDA and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations.

Don will then close with his perspective on the business, followed by Q&A.","In our fiscal fourth quarter, volume was down 3%, and sales were about flat versus the year-ago period, reflecting the factors we discussed with you on our last call, including unusually cold weather conditions that affected our Charcoal business, as well as the impact of declining foreign currencies. We also saw heightened competitive activity, which I will talk about more in a moment.","For the full year, volume was flat although sales grew 3% within the outlook we provided at the beginning of the year. For the second consecutive year, we're pleased to have delivered more than 3 points of incremental growth from innovation.","Turning to our categories. In the fourth quarter, we saw modest growth of 40 basis points in the U.S., with gains in Laundry following our concentrated bleach transition, as well as Home Care, Water Filtration, Cat Litter and Natural Personal Care. The only material declines were in the Bags and Wraps category and that was solely in the nonstrategic food storage segment, as well as the Charcoal category, which was impacted by poor weather well into the quarter.","In Q4, our multi-outlet market share results in the U.S. were essentially flat, reflecting a decline of 10 basis points with mixed performance across our categories. Glad share was up strongly for the fourth consecutive quarter behind our premium OdorShield offering. Burt's Bees in the Natural Personal Care category was also up nicely as was Charcoal, which rebounded in recent weeks with improving weather. Overall results were impacted most strongly by a share decline in our Laundry additives category, driven by increased private label support for bleach at key retailers, as well as heightened competitive activity in our Cleaning business. I'll talk more about our plans to address market shares in a moment.","With that, let me turn to our fourth quarter segment results. In the fourth quarter, our Cleaning segment volume declined 4% with sales down 1%, driven slowly by declines in our Home Care business due to competitive activity in Disinfecting Wipes and Toilet Bowl Cleaners. After achieving a near record high market share on Wipes earlier in the year, we're seeing competition aggressively step up spending. Despite a challenging fourth quarter, the Home Care business did deliver strong results for the full year, including record shipments across Disinfecting Wipes during the height of the flu season.","Looking ahead, we have strong plans in place to address our recent decline and emphasis on expanding wipes usage to new occasions, increasing our merchandising support as we lapped last year last year's flu season and launching new products in fiscal '14.","Volume in our Laundry business was flat, and sales were up modestly as we lapped last year's Phase 1 rollout of concentrated bleach and continued to see high levels of merchandising activity on private label bleach. Looking back over the year, we feel good about the progress made on our Bleach business, achieving the highest level of sales growth in 4 years -- excuse me, in 20 years and significant gross margin improvement as we benefit from the cost savings related to our concentrated bleach conversion.","While our market shares have been challenged, we expect these declines to moderate over time behind increased demand building spending and recent assortment gains on shelf.","Lastly, our Professional Products business again delivered very strong growth with broad-based gains in Food, Cleaning and base Healthcare.","In our Household segment, Q4 volume was down 1%, while sales grew 2% with growth in Glad and Cat Litter, more than offset by a decline in Charcoal. As we discussed on last quarter's call, the impact of very poor weather drove soft consumption in our Charcoal business through the early part of the fourth quarter. As anticipated, market shares rebounded into positive territory for the quarter and were even stronger in the last 4 weeks.","Our Glad business delivered another strong quarter with gains in volume, sales and market share, driven by our premium trash bag business as our trade-up strategy continued to yield positive results.","Our Lifestyle segment saw a flat volume with sales growth of 2%. Our Food business had another strong quarter with growth in Hidden Valley salad dressing, as well as from the launch of pasta salad kits. Despite double-digit retail consumption, Burt's Bees sales were up only slightly due to a comparison against double-digit growth in the year-ago quarter when we began shipping several new products. Burt's Bees is off to a strong start in fiscal year '14 due to carryover from the recent lip color product launches, good consumption on the face line and strong demand creation focused on the base business.","Brita faced another challenging quarter, as we lapped the pipeline build from last year's Brita Bottle launch and continued to see competitive activity. We remain focused on bringing innovation to the Water Filtration category. In July, we launched new kids bottles with Nickelodeon characters in advance of the back-to-school season and have additional innovation launching later this calendar year.","In our International section, volume declined 6% with sales down 1%. As has been the case for several quarters, roughly 1\/3 of our business comprising developed markets continue to provide economic stability to the portfolio. The approximate 1\/3 of our business composed of Argentina and Venezuela continue to face economic headwinds that we've seen throughout the year, particularly margin compression reflecting very high inflation and the inability to take price increases due to price controls, coupled with declining currencies. And the remaining 1\/3 of the business, which is mostly in developing markets, continue to perform very well as we focus on driving profitable growth with the Burt's Bees expansion, as well as in our established businesses in key countries such as Chile, Peru, Mexico and others. In these markets, our categories continue to grow at double-digit rates on a local currency basis.","Looking forward, stabilizing Venezuela and Argentina remains a priority, while we drive growth and innovation across the balance of the business. As we close the year, we feel good about the strong growth in Professional Products, Glad, Food and Burt's Bees, as well as the very successful transition to concentrated bleach. That said, we are disappointed with the results on our Charcoal business, driven by the unusually cold weather, the unfavorable effect from foreign currencies, as well as some of the market share declines seen from recent competitive activity.","Looking ahead, we continue to anticipate sales growth for fiscal year '14 in the range of 2% to 4% with the first half of the year at the lower end, if not below that range, due to the competitive activity I've discussed, foreign currency headwinds and challenges in Venezuela and Argentina. We anticipate stronger top line performance in the second half as our plans to address the competitive environment take hold and we benefit from innovation.","With that, I'll turn it over to Steve Robb.","Stephen M. Robb","Thanks, Steve. Welcome, everyone. I'll start by reviewing our fourth quarter and fiscal year financial results and then discuss our outlook for fiscal '14. In our fourth quarter, sales were flat, reflecting 3 points of pricing benefit, offset by 3 points in volume decline. Our sales results were also impacted by about a point of foreign currency, offset by favorable mix and lower trade spending. Excluding the impact of foreign currencies, sales grew 1.3%.","Turning to gross margin. We're very pleased with the strong finish to the year, with an increase of 130 basis points to 44% of sales compared with 42.7% in the year-ago quarter. The biggest factors contributing to gross margin improvement were cost savings of 150 basis points and about 120 basis points from pricing. These factors were partially offset by higher manufacturing and logistics costs, which reflect continued high inflation in Latin America. As expected, commodity costs were about flat year-over-year.","For the fourth quarter, we delivered diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.38, a 5% increase versus the year-ago quarter.","Next, I'll turn to our results for the full fiscal year. Sales were up a solid 3% in fiscal '13, with gains in all 4 segments, reflecting the benefit of price increases, moderated by the weather's impact on our Charcoal business in the second half of the fiscal year, declining foreign currencies and challenging market conditions in Argentina and Venezuela. Fiscal '13 gross margin was up 80 basis points to 42.9% compared with 42.1% in fiscal '12, reflecting 160 basis points in cost savings and 120 basis points in pricing. We're proud of the track record for delivering cost savings, and fiscal '13 marks more than 10 consecutive years we delivered at least 150 basis points of margin improvement from our cost savings programs. These factors were partially offset by the impact of higher manufacturing and logistics costs due to high inflation and price controls in Venezuela and Argentina.","Selling and administrative expense for the full fiscal year was 14.4% of sales, down slightly versus fiscal '12, primarily driven by lapping nearly $12 million in advisory fees related to the withdrawn proxy contest last year and reduced costs associated with prior infrastructure-related investments. These benefits were partially offset by higher wages and employee benefits, largely due to inflation, as well as investments in systems and processes to support the long-term growth of the Burt's Bees business.","Advertising spending for the full fiscal year was about 9% of sales, a modest increase versus the year-ago period. Importantly, our U.S. Retail spending was nearly 10% of sales, a 5.5% increase versus a year ago, reflecting continued support for our domestic brands and categories. Advertising spending in our International business was lower, as we reduced investments in markets with challenging economic environments and reallocated the funds to our U.S. business.","Our effective tax rate of 32.7% on earnings from continuing operations was up over 1 point versus fiscal '12, reducing diluted earnings per share by about $0.09.","Free cash flow for the full fiscal year increased to $583 million or about 10% of sales versus $428 million or about 8% of sales in fiscal '12. This increase was the result of favorable changes in working capital, the prior year settlement of interest rate forward contracts and higher earnings. In fiscal '14, we anticipate free cash flow as a percentage of sales to be about 10%. As a reminder, we define free cash flow as cash provided by continuing operations less capital expenditures.","In the fourth quarter, we sold our former R&D facility in Pleasanton, California. That transaction, combined with the second quarter sale of our general office building in Oakland, California, resulted in net sales proceeds of $135 million for the full fiscal year. Consistent with our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders, we increased our dividend by 11% and resumed share repurchases in the fourth quarter, purchasing 1.5 million shares for $128 million. We ended the quarter with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.1, at the low end of our targeted range of 2 to 2.5.","Net of all the factors I've discussed today, in fiscal '13, we delivered diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.31, an increase of 5% versus fiscal '12.","Now we'll turn to our fiscal year 2014 outlook. As Steve mentioned, we anticipate sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%, with the first half of the year at the lower end and possibly below that range. Contributing factors include a challenging comparison to about 5.5% sales growth in the first half of fiscal '13, heightened competitive pressure on Laundry additives and Disinfecting Wipes and about a point of impact from foreign currency declines. As you saw from our press release, the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar is putting more pressure on sales than we had previously anticipated. If exchange rates remain elevated, our full year sales and earnings results will be negatively impacted.","For the full fiscal year, we continue to anticipate gross margin to be about flat, reflecting cost savings of 150 basis points and the benefit of price increases, offset by about 1 point from inflation impacting manufacturing and logistics costs and about 1 point from commodity cost increases. We anticipate significant downward pressure on gross margin in the first half of the fiscal year due to the challenges in Venezuela and Argentina and the impact of elevated commodity costs, mostly from resin.","However, we anticipate improvement in the second half of the year, driven by some pricing benefit in International and moderating commodity costs. We're closely monitoring oil prices since they've rallied significantly over the last month and remain above our outlook for $90 to $100 per barrel, which, in the near term, are driving some commodity costs above our forecast. If energy costs remain elevated, our margins will be pressured and we'll have to take a hard look at pricing.","We continue to anticipate EBIT margin to increase between 25 and 50 basis points, reflecting lower selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales and consistent with our long-term goal of reducing this item to 14% or less of sales. Due to the timing of spending, we expect expenses to be higher in the first half of the fiscal year. We also anticipate a higher effective tax rate of 34% to 35% in the next fiscal year. The company's outlook continues to reflect $0.05 to $0.10 of diluted earnings per share impact, mostly affecting the first half of the fiscal year related to the anticipated effects of continued price controls and high inflation in both Argentina and Venezuela, as well as the carryover impact from the devaluation of the bol\u00edvar in February. As a reminder, we are not assuming any additional Venezuela currency devaluation in our fiscal '14 outlook at this time. Net of all of these factors, we anticipate diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.55 to $4.70 in fiscal '14.","In closing, I'm pleased we delivered solid results in fiscal '13. Our team's hard work to deliver strong cost savings and margin improvement has certainly paid off. I'm also very pleased that we met or beat our financial targets compared to our fiscal '13 outlook we provided a year ago, including 3% sales growth against our range of 2% to 4%, 60 basis points of EBIT margin improvement versus our target of 25 to 50 basis points and $4.31 of diluted earnings per share versus our range of $4.20 to $4.35. Moving forward, we'll continue to be very -- on managing through the macroeconomic challenges we continue to face, as well as the recent changes in the economy impacting both foreign currencies and commodity costs.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Don.","Donald R. Knauss","Okay. Thanks, Steve, and hello, everyone, on the call. And while I feel good about our results overall for the year, I'm sure we all would've liked to had concluded with stronger sales in the fourth quarter and we'll talk more about that as our plans for the fiscal year '14. But there are many parts of the portfolio that performed well in the fourth quarter, notably our premium brands such as Glad, Hidden Valley and Burt's Bees as certainly as well as our Professional Products business, which had strong double-digit growth again.","Now at the same time, our recent top line results were dampened by an increasing intense competitive environment that Steve mentioned, particularly in our Cleaning segment. But I would say we've got strong plans in place to address the heightened competitive environment where it's affecting our business. And while it will take some time to turn those shares around, I'm very enthusiastic about the demand building plans we have, including the innovation we recently launched, and we have teed up for fiscal '14 with another round of innovation coming in January of '14. So as Steve discussed, we're also facing commodity costs and currency headwinds as we enter fiscal '14. We've seen a run-up in resin cost, which impact us across the business. We continue to anticipate meaningful currency declines in Argentina, and the U.S. dollar has certainly strengthened across many geographies so we're closely monitoring both.","Looking at the full year, which is our focus, I really do feel good about the accomplishments that Steve just mentioned, but we did deliver that solid sales growth of 3%. We had gross margin expansions of 80 basis points. And we slightly reduced SG&A costs as a percent of sales, resulting in 8% pretax profit growth and economic profit of $426 million, and that was an increase of 6% versus last year.","And we said many times that we manage our business on an annual basis, recognizing that we're going to get some variability in quarters. But looking at '14 -- or looking at fiscal '13, for example, we had about 5.5% sales growth in the first half and less than 1% growth in the second half. We're one of those periods now that we encounter on occasion where the going is a little tough and it's going to continue for the next couple of quarters. But I certainly feel confident that the strength of our brands, the heightened investment we're putting behind them in fiscal '14, and the continued innovation you'll see in nearly every part of our business will return stronger results, certainly, by the second half of this year, enabling us to deliver solid results for the entire year.","Now just stepping back for a moment from the year, we also take a longer view over the horizon of our strategic plans. Our Centennial Strategy successfully guided us through the most challenging economic period we've all witnessed since World War II. If you look at the 5-year period of Centennial, and this is when it was firmly embedded in our plans, this would be from July 1, 2008 through June 30 of this year. We consistently grew sales and economic profit, delivering a 3% compounded annual growth rate for sales and a 6% compounded annual growth rate for economic profit. I think, as you all know, we also generated strong cash flow that enabled us to significantly increase our annual dividend rate from $1.60 to $2.56, with our recent 11% increase to our dividend in May. That marks the 36th consecutive year we've increased total annual dividends paid to our stockholders.","Most importantly, between the share price gains, share repurchases and increase in total annual dividends paid to our stockholders, we delivered total shareholder returns of 88% in that 5-year period compared to an average of 82% for our peer group and about 40% for the S&P 500. So looking ahead to the 2020 strategy, I really do believe we have strong plans that build on our success from Centennial, and we all look forward to reviewing that with you at our Analyst Day here in California on October 3. For those of you who can attend, you'll have an opportunity also to tour our state-of-the-art innovation center. This is the new investment we made over the last year, and you can see how we're really bringing new product ideas and packaging ideas to life. And if you haven't made plans yet to attend, please do so soon. Steve and the IR team can answer any questions you may have about that.","And with that, let's go ahead and open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And at this time, we'll take a question from Ian Gordon with S&P Capital IQ.","Ian J. Gordon - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","So you commented, I think, in the release that advertising as a percent of sales in the U.S. was 9% in the quarter. I think your longer-term targets are 9% to 10%, and I know a lot of the overall lower level in the past year has to do with some of the pullbacks overseas. But this maybe seems like the first time the U.S. is coming in a little bit low. Can you perhaps shed some light on that? And do you think maybe that had any of the impact on your sales in those categories where you were facing a lot of competition?","Donald R. Knauss","Yes, Ian, this is Don. The actual spending was 9.2% for the U.S. Retail business. It was a little below 9% if you include the PPD, which is our business that is going into -- basically into hospitals. So if you exclude that, where you don't have typical advertising, it was actually at 9.2%. And that compares to 8.8% a year ago, so it was actually up. And if you look at the full year, it was in the high 9s. So I feel pretty good about both the quarter being up and the full year being up. And if you look at the brands where we typically face off with private label, for example, Glad trash, Charcoal and bleach, 2 of those brands in the last 13 weeks have gained pretty significant share. So Glad gained 0.8 share point and Charcoal's gained 0.8 share point. Clearly, we have some challenges on bleach, which we'll be addressing. But I think -- I don't think it's a function of the advertising spend at all because, as I said, both in the quarter and the full year, we're up.","Operator","Looking forward, we will hear from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","What are your category growth assumptions, maybe I missed it, for next year to kind of get to the 2% to 4%?","Stephen M. Robb","Yes, well, this is Steve. Category growth assumption hasn't changed from the last time we discussed this on our last call. Basically, we're assuming categories are flat to up about 0.5 point to 1 point so somewhere in that range. We do expect category growth is going to be sluggish. Importantly, we are counting on 3 points of incremental sales growth from innovation and feel very good about that. And again, embedded in the outlook is also about 1 point of foreign exchange headwinds. And again, as you saw in the press release, and as I mentioned, that's something we're also monitoring carefully.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. The 3 points of innovation, can you just talk a little bit more about what you have out there in the trade already that's going to drive the 3 points?","Donald R. Knauss","Yes, if you look at, for example -- or let's just take the innovation that's going out the last few months, Bill, if you look at the spray cleaners like the new tubeless technology on spray cleaners, there's been a number of new color additions on the Burt's Bees line; new fragrances on the bleach line; new fragrances on the Glad OdorShield line, the new lavender there; the new hard-sided Brita Bottles and then the Nickelodeon bottles for kids on the Brita On-The-Go bottles. So it's pretty widely spread across every major brand we have. And you'll see another round of innovation as we come into January this year. Bleach, for example, we had 2 new SKUs that just started shipping in June. That would be -- these were on the king sizes, that was a new Splash-less and another fragrance on the king size, so we got incremental shelf space on those. So it's pretty broadly across the full range of the major brands.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And why do you think the category growth is still sluggish? Because like, there's certain signs like there's green shoots in the economy and some categories are accelerating and other are still flat so -- and what's the best way to explain that?","Donald R. Knauss","Yes. I think it's more about competitive intensity than it is about any particular drama with the consumer. Our categories, when you think about it, are really in this fairly tight band of up 2 or down 2. And when I look at the competitive intensity in the last 13 weeks, you've got a number of multinational brand players who are refocusing on the U.S. market. And we're seeing increased trade spending, which is lowering pricing and taking dollars out of the category. And I think that's -- it's really more of a phenomenon than a competitive intensity that we're seeing rather than it is the consumer shifting their buying habits because if you look at our shares, for example, the last 52 weeks, we've lost less than 1% of our share and private label's gained about 1%, up a couple of tenths. So there's not any real dramatic movements in shares. So I think it's more about the competitive intensity taking dollars out.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And then just one last one. What's the sticks on bleach? The product's great, obviously. Private label has been pretty aggressive. I mean, how -- you said you had some plans in place. I'm just curious what they are.","Donald R. Knauss","Yes, it's interesting on the category. This is the strongest category growth rates we've seen probably in over 20 years on bleach, 8.5% category growth in the last 13 weeks, 7% category growth in the last 52 weeks. There are 2 things we're focused on, Bill, one is merchandising. We've got to get back into a more national cadence on merchandising because of the staggered role we did, which we just completed in March. Recall we started that role in August of '12, we completed it March of '13. We couldn't do national merchandising events with a number of national footprint and customers. We're starting to get back into that. So that's one. Second, we're also going to increase the number of events we have this year, so you'll see at least a 10% increase in merchandising events. The other thing you'll see is more innovation on large sizes, more fragrances, different formats like Splash-less, and we're focused on getting increased shelf space with those new items.","Operator","At this time, we'll take a question from Joe Lachky with Wells Fargo Securities.","Joe Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I was just hoping you might be able to pair through some the reasons for the top line weakness in the quarter, and more so, like, why you guys didn't really see it coming from a few months ago. And maybe if you could, along those lines, kind of quantify the impact versus your expectations way between Home Care, Charcoal and International, those 3 buckets.","Stephen M. Robb","Well, let me start off and then I think Don and Steve can weigh in. I think going into the quarter, the one thing that we did anticipate and we did communicate was the fact that the weather was particularly bad and that was impacting our Charcoal business. You might recall that we had indicated that April weather wasn't particularly good and that's certainly carried into May. So that was not a surprise to us. And it was for that reason that we actually indicated that our sales outlook of 3% to 4% was likely to be at the low end of the range. Now I think the other thing that we saw in the quarter was that the merchandising and competitive intensity, primarily on the Disinfecting Wipes business, it really ramped up significantly. And if I was to point to one thing that's different, that would be the item. I think importantly, as Steve said in his opening comments, the Charcoal, as the weather has begun to improve, we've really seen that business bounce back nicely. And we're putting plans in place to vigorously defend the shares of our Disinfecting Wipes business and so we feel good that we're taking the right steps there. And while it's going to take a couple of quarters, we're certainly taking actions to defend that business as well. But those are probably the 2 things that I would point you to.","Joe Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then I guess on -- follow-up, I guess, on the Cleaning segment where you're seeing a lot of promotion on the Wipes business. I mean, obviously, that offset a number of the positives that you had with the bleach selling and Professional Products. I mean, was there anything else in there driving weakness? I mean, was that all Wipes? And I guess, that would lead me to believe that there was a pretty serious deterioration in the level of sales for Wipes. And if it's all driven by essentially competitive promotion, does that mean that essentially price and promotions are the primary consumer consideration in the Wipes category? It's really not based upon branding at all?","Donald R. Knauss","Well, I would say that recall that -- because I don't want 1 quarter to paint a picture on Wipes, that this has been an extremely successful franchise for the company. I mean, we reached a 60 share last September. And I think we're still -- while we're not happy with the fact that we've lost significant share down into the 50 range in the last 3 months, we think those shares will start to improve in the second half with some innovation. But there was very aggressive pricing in a couple of major retailers. And given the size of the business, it's not a $2 billion or a $1 billion brand. It's a several hundred million dollar brand. You can get movement like that on shares pretty dramatically. So I think it's -- you're going to see from us a couple of things, Joe. One is your going to see more innovation coming in the second half of the year. You're also going to see us drive at least 5 pulse periods on Wipes where last year we had about 3 pulse periods. So we're going to amp up the merchandising. We're going to defend this business just like we've done in the past. And one of the learnings we got after H1N1, we were all concerned, remember 4 years ago, about lapping that spike from H1N1. We're getting back into the same kind of merchandising cadence we did the following year there where we protected that business. So I wouldn't want one quarter of fairly dramatic share erosion, to paint a picture, that this business is in a steady decline because it's not. We got caught and sometimes it's not bad to get punched. It wakes you up, and we're wide awake right now.","Operator","And we'll go to Michael Steib with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Steib - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Can I ask 2 questions, please? One is going back to the question on pricing. I was wondering what level of pricing is implied really in your 2% to 4% sales growth outlook for next year and how could that change if your price indeed does stay where it is now? I think you indicated that you would review the pricing strategy, if that was the case. And secondly, why are the margins in the Lifestyle segment down? It's the only segment, the domestic segment, where it's down. I was just wondering if you could explain why that's the case.","Stephen M. Robb","So starting with pricing in our outlook of 2% to 4%, we do have some pricing built in. Some of it is a carryover of the price increases we took in fiscal '13. And we have some incremental pricing, primarily in the second half. It's been assumed in International markets where you're dealing with very high rates of inflation. So I would say we have a modest level of pricing. And if energy costs remain elevated for an extended period of time, we'll have to go back and take a hard look at that and figure out what's the right level of pricing. But at this point, you'll see less pricing in '14 than '13, but we're monitoring the energy markets and the impact that that's going to have on our feedstocks over time. In terms of the margins in Lifestyle, we're making some incremental investments in our Burt's Bees business in particular. One is to support the growth of the business. That business has been on fire. It's been growing double digits for quite some time. And one of the things that's happened is we've actually outgrown our systems platform that we have in the business and so we are in the process of basically transitioning them from their current systems platform over to the U.S. SAP platform that we have, and we're making some incremental investments to do that. And you're seeing that come through in their profitability. That will continue into the first couple of quarters of this fiscal '14, but it should generate not only better growth over time but also some additional cost savings for us.","Operator","And at this time, we'll take a question from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So a few things. One is the 3% incremental for next year expected from innovation. We got that number often. How much of that, if you could, is price -- incremental price versus incremental volume, just on that piece? Because obviously if you take that away from the 2% to 4% growth number. You're talking about flattish underlying growth. And I would've hoped that gets a little bit better, particularly around the bleach compaction that should be increasing that category's growth rate like you've seen so far.","Stephen M. Robb","Ali, the 3% growth number that we have been talking about and actually delivering and oftentimes meeting [ph], that is the incremental sales on a year-over-year basis net of cannibalization. So it does not include pricing, either up or down. It's really just the incremental lift that we're getting from the new products, again, net of cannibalization.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","But the sales at -- at this time, sales have 2 components, right, price and volume. If it's net of cannibalization, what's incremental? So pure share gain? Is that another way to think about it, volume share gain? Or is there price because it's innovation and you're taking prices on that innovation? You know what I'm getting at?","Stephen M. Robb","Well, I would say, generally, its incremental volume that we're picking up. But again, if you bring new products to market that are at higher price points, if you're treating the consumer up to premium products, you'll certainly have that in there. Does that answer your question?","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. Sort of, I guess. Let me shift a little bit to the competitive situation, which you mentioned a couple of times, both on the release and in this call, and trying to get an understanding a little bit more about that. So if it is in a particular set of categories, Home Care, Wipes, in particular, you've talked about, and if it is extra trade spend, why does it take 6 months to respond?","Donald R. Knauss","No, I don't think it takes 6 months to respond. The response is almost immediate. You'll see response in this quarter starting in July. You'll see response, Ali. It doesn't take 6 months. What does take 6 months is just I'm talking about the cadence on our innovation, which is a July, January cadence. So what I'm speaking of is the merchandising response begins immediately. Those 5 pulse periods I talked about, for example, are spread across the year, including starting this fall. The next wave of innovation is in January. So that's what I'm speaking about.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And then my last question is, you make note of your 2.1 debt-to-EBITDA, which is the low end of your 2 to 2.5. Can you talk about that in the context of what you'd do with that extra flexibility? So M&A has been something you've done in the Away From Home category, some smaller ones here and there soften, et cetera. Can you tell us how you think about M&A given that flexibility versus buybacks as another example?","Stephen M. Robb","Sure. Our uses of cash remain essentially unchanged. Our #1 priority is to support the organic growth in all the things that we've talked this morning, but also bolt-on acquisitions. If we've got opportunities, particularly in the Professional Products space but even in U.S. consumer packaged goods, if there's attractive businesses that offer good growth and margins, we'll certainly look at that and we've got enough dry powder to be able to do bolt-on acquisitions. So that's probably the highest priority. Second priority has been to support the dividend. We know that's important to a lot of our investors and in the fourth quarter. You saw a fairly nice increase there of 11% on the dividend. And finally, I would say we are going to look at share buybacks over time. We did it, we entered the market as I mentioned in my opening comments, to pick up about 1.5 million shares. We've been out of the market for a while as we focused on paying down debt. I think you'll see us certainly come back into the market to offset stock option dilution and soak up the incremental shares that have been out there for a bit of time. Beyond that, if we start to build up cash and we don't have a need for it, in partnership with the board as we always do, we'll look for ways to get that back to the shareholders, either in share repurchases or dividends over time.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","In your second priority, how far off the 2, 2.5 or even higher would you be willing to go in this current environment for M&A?","Stephen M. Robb","I would say that 2 to 2.5 is the right long-term number for the company. That doesn't mean it couldn't actually go a little below that over time, if you're building up some dry powder for transactions. If we had a really attractive transaction, again, that met our criteria, we'd be willing to float a little above the 2.5 for a short period of time. But I think if we did that, what you would see is that we would work to get that paid back down. We recognize that interest rates are fairly low right now, obviously, but I think it's also important that we keep the leverage ratios in check for the long term as well.","Operator","At this time, we'll go to Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Sorry for coming back to the Wipes side. Looking at the data that we get from truck channels, what we see is that the share losses are to a private label. And essentially, your Wipes are 25% premium to private label. So I guess the question is, what changed in private label? Is it that there is new capacity there for private label that it wasn't before? And to what extent that is a structural change in the industry that may force you to...","Donald R. Knauss","Yes, let me start on Wipes, first of all, just for some background, regardless of the fourth quarter where we obviously saw the decline, Wipes had a strong year mid-single-digit growth rate in volume. So it was still a really good year on Wipes. But -- and the price gaps versus private label on a day-to-day basis really haven't changed. I mean, we haven't taken pricing on Wipes in over 10 years. So it's not a question really of every day pricing. It's a question of merchandising support, add feature activity and shelf positioning where private label is on the shelf vis-\u00e0-vis our power offering. And this is isn't concentrated in a few key customers. So it's not an everyday price issue. It's more of that merchandising phenomenon I talked about and that's why it's so important for us to increase the pulse periods we're going to drive against.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","But the data also shows that you had been increasing volume for -- on the merchandising. So it seems to me that probably there could have been something on the private label side in terms of a new co-packer out there. Is something in that regard that you know of that may have triggered the accumulation of buildup of market share in the last 6 months?","Donald R. Knauss","No structural change that we've seen in the category other than the increase in merchandising supports and changes in packaging graphics and which -- and some changes in shelf positioning items being moved to eye level that may have been on the top or the bottom of the shelf in some retailers. But no other structural change in terms of capacity in the category or a new entrant.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","And just for -- just for clarifying and then this is my last question. Is it -- do you produce Wipes internally or you do it with a co-packer?","Stephen M. Robb","We use a mix of sources for that, but we use a co-packer primarily to produce a lot of the volume and have long-term arrangements put in place.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","So the -- so that co-packer could be producing the same thing for private labels, right?","Donald R. Knauss","I don't want to comment on -- yes, I don't really want to get into that for competitive reasons, but I will just say there are different formulations. Our substrate, which we think is superior in Cleaning and that's what the consumer tells us in blind testing, we have a different substrate than what you'd see in private label. We also have different chemistry on the disinfectant formulas. So in terms of cleaning and disinfecting efficacy, we win. We have superior offerings in both those dimensions. So we feel very good about the offering. So again, once we get back into this more aggressive merchandising support, which we will amp it up, and get back to some innovation in January, which will get us more shelf space, we feel like we've got the right plans in place.","Operator","And moving forward, you will hear from Olivia Tong with Bank of America.","Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I want to talk about price versus volume. What -- was the makeup of contribution from price, was that in line with what you expected? And can you sort of parse out how much was in price mix? How much was price versus mix?","Stephen M. Robb","Are you talking about gross margin to clarify?","Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","No, on the top line.","Stephen M. Robb","On the top line. So we picked up about, in the quarter, fourth quarter, we picked about 3 points from pricing and we picked up a little bit from mix, offset, as Steve mentioned in his comments, by about 3 points of volume decline.","Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Right. And I'm trying to understand how much -- was that pricing in line with what you had expected and then also...","Donald R. Knauss","I would say pretty much in line, Olivia, with what we expected. If you want to look at trying to understand the relative impact of volume versus price, it was more impact from volume than it was price. And volume and mix were pretty strong.","Stephen M. Robb","Correct.","Donald R. Knauss","And that's what not only drove the top line, it drove the gross margin expansion.","Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And then on compacted bleach, just a philosophical question, but has there been any change to purchasing patterns other than, obviously, consumers needing to purchase half as much as they used to? Are there any differences in terms of acceptance on compaction? Or is there anything in terms of one region versus another?","Donald R. Knauss","We're not seeing much change in region, although we did see more trade-up to king size in the middle part of the country. But there are a couple of things that are interesting that's going on and I think that are certainly driving the category into these mid-high single digits. One is we're seeing proper dosing now. In fact, we may see some overdosing and that certainly was the phenomenon years ago when laundry detergent first compacted. So people can get the proper dose now. We're also seeing less out of stocks because we've got about 24% more units on the shelf in the category. So less out of stocks is obviously driving the volume as well. And I think third -- the third thing we're seeing is we are seeing a change with the Bleachable Moments campaign of Millennials coming into the category. So we are seeing a mid-high single-digit increase in people under the age of 35 coming into the category. And most of that -- a lot of that is not just for laundry use, it's for disinfecting and cleaning around the house, which leads to higher volume. Typically, Cleaning drives higher usage volume than Laundry does.","Operator","And at this time, we'll move to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I know you guys have gotten questioned many times in the past about the difference between Nielsen numbers and then what you report. But I was just curious this time around if your perception of retail inventories, particularly in some of the categories, where sales fell short of expectations.","Steve Austenfeld","Lauren, this is Steve. We look at this pretty closely at the end of every quarter. And this quarter, there didn't appear to be any major variance or difference in retail inventories. I would say early part of the quarter, we might have been a little concerned on Charcoal just because the sales have been down due to the weather, but it picked up strongly towards the latter part and we're refining that category as well.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then in the, I think it was the press release and then also in the commentary, the 2 businesses mentioned that haven't been discussed so far were Clorox 2 and Toilet Bowl Cleaner as areas of kind of, again, increased activity and some challenges. So just anything you can offer there would be great.","Donald R. Knauss","Yes, on Clorox 2, Lauren, I think it's a continuing relevance in question. I think we've got a repositioning on that brand more as a stain fighter. We've been focused on that the last few months, we'll continue to drive that. There's some new innovation coming there in January as well. On Toilet Bowl Cleaner, more of a merchandising uptick by competitors than anything else. We saw the same phenomenon on spray cleaners, with some innovation on spray cleaners from some of the multinational competitors and a focus on driving merchandising against that innovation. So both from -- there were several multinationals that came out with spray cleaning innovation and then, obviously, supported that with some heavier merchandising.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And on Clorox 2, I mean, is there work that you guys have done or plans you can talk about similar to Bleachable Moments for regular bleach, right, to try to get at this usage and relevancy issue? Because I feel like it's been a couple of times of trying to answer this challenge with products. Or maybe it's a merchandising and positioning question?","Donald R. Knauss","Yes, we do think, given that our testing on the product efficacy against most stains is superior to our competition, we haven't done, to your point, Lauren, a very good job of communicating that from a positioning and marketing standpoint. So that's really the focus going forward is, to your point, understanding how to better position the efficacy we have in this product.","Operator","At this time, we'll take a question from Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital Markets.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","You said or alluded to in your prepared remarks that if foreign exchange and raw materials stayed at elevated levels, it could have an impact. So could you quantify, if they do stay at these rates, what sort of margin compression or EPS risk you think there is?","Stephen M. Robb","I'm not going to give you a specific number. I would say this. Let me take each one in turn, starting with foreign currency. What we've embedded in the outlook, as you saw from our press release and our comments, was about 1 point of foreign exchange headwinds. I think the risk is if the spot rates stay at today's level, and I would just remind everybody that foreign exchange markets are incredibly volatile so this can change pretty quickly one direction or the other, we will have downward pressure but I think it's premature to speculate as to what that would be. We're 1-month into a fiscal year. We've got a lot of time left. Commodity costs, certainly, we're going to see a little bit more pressure in the first quarter than we may have originally anticipated. We have built into our outlook 1 point of gross margin compression from commodity cost increases. What I would say is that in order for us to see greater than that, you'd have to see oil remain elevated for an extended period of time. And if that was to happen, than it will put more downward pressure on the margins and it's something we're watching carefully, but then we would respond over time by taking pricing to recover it. But beyond that, we need to get further into the year to really see how this is going to affect both sales and earnings, if at all.","Operator","At this time, we'll go to Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A quick question. You ran through a number of headwinds in the first half, lower sales growth, lower gross margins, higher expenses. Should we expect any earnings growth in the first half of the year?","Stephen M. Robb","I would say earnings growth is -- earnings are going to be challenged in the first half and earnings could potentially -- actually be down. This is something we're watching closely. And I think what we're going to have to see is what really happens with low foreign exchange, as well as commodity cost and how that, plus competition, plays out in the first half. But I think it's fair to say that earnings growth will be much better in the second half. And at this point, we do have plans in place to get to the outlook range that we've shared. But it will be a much more challenged in the first half than the second half.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Is it fair to say that the second half acceleration is contingent upon the success of this competitive response that you're mounting?","Stephen M. Robb","That's certainly one piece of it, but we also think that when you look at sales, we've got strong innovation that Don talked about. We've got the plans that we're putting in place to vigorously defend our shares. That should get traction as we move through the year. And we even have comps that are a bit softer and you're looking at it in the second half year-over-year. So for a lot of reasons, we think certainly the sales growth is going to be much better in the second half than the first half. And the same thing with margins. We're expecting much better margins in the second half than the first half.","Donald R. Knauss","And Jason, I don't want to overplay the competitive response. If you look at the challenges we've had on Wipes and bleach, for example, Wipes in the last quarter, bleach for the last 9 to 12 months, those 2 represent about 12% to 15% of our overall business. So -- and if you throw in the entire Home Care side, including spray cleaners, you're talking about 1\/5 of our business. So when you see -- we've seen strong growth on Glad, strong growth on Litter in the recent couple of quarters, Charcoal coming back, Food still strong, Burt's still strong, PPD very strong. So I don't want to overplay the competitive intensity but it is going to be a challenge, certainly, in the first half of the year. And obviously, the comp, we're comping 5.5% growth as well. So -- but I wouldn't want to paint the picture that the competitive intensity is dialing up and hurting 50%, 60%, 70% of our portfolio because it's just not accurate.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. I want to come back real quick, just to get comfort on this back half acceleration. Is there anything unique about the shape of inflation throughout the year or the shape of your productivity curve?","Stephen M. Robb","Well, in terms of gross margins, at least we look at commodity costs, we do think that, again, we've got about 1 point of margin compression from higher commodity costs. It's likely based on what we know. It will likely be a bit more in the first half and a bit less in the second half because we -- our outlook is for oil to be in this range of $90 to $100. The other thing I would just point out too is you think of the margins first half, second half and inflation, tremendous challenges at Argentina and Venezuela in the first half. The combination of price controls and inflation is really putting a drag on the gross margin in the first half. We do anticipate that the second half is going to be a bit better and that we are likely to be able to get some pricing through in the second half, and that should again take some of the pressure off the margin as well.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Knauss, I'd like to turn the call back over to you.","Donald R. Knauss","Okay. Well, we appreciate everybody being on the call today. I know there were a lot of competing calls going on, and we look forward to seeing everybody in October out at our Analyst Day when we share the 2020 strategy with everyone. So thanks, and take care.","Operator","Again, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"5212":["The Clorox Co.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Mr. Steve Robb, Chief Financial Officer for The Clorox Company. Mr. Robb, you may begin your conference.","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Thank you, and hello, everyone. Before we start with our prepared remarks, I wanted to acknowledge Lisah Burhan's participation on the call. As you may recall, Lisah had previously worked in Investor Relations and is now back and we're very pleased we're going to be able to expand the team with Lisah taking on several responsibilities including the quarterly earnings calls. She has worked in every one of our business segments and will be a great addition to our team. Steve Austenfeld, who you have known for years, will continue to be a leader in Investor Relations. And going forward, you'll continue to see both Lisah and Steve at investor meetings, conferences and at our next Analyst Meeting on October 5 in New York.","The flow of the call will be the same as in the past. Lisah will cover performance by segment, I'll address our financial results and outlook, and finally, Benno will close with his perspective before we open it up to your questions.","With that, I will turn it over to Lisah to cover our segment results.","Lisah Burhan - The Clorox Co.","Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'm glad to be back in IR and I certainly look forward to working with all of you in the future. But before we jump into results, let's remind you of a few things. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com.","On today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including but not limited to free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enable investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations.","Reconciliations with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks, or supplemental information available on our website as well as in our SEC filings. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release.","Please also recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.","With that, I'll cover results. For the total company, fourth quarter volume and sales grew 3%, with sales growing all across all segments. Our sales in the track channels remain healthy. We continue to see particularly strong growth in non-track channels including growth in e-Commerce, Home Hardware and Club.","Turning to results by segment; in Cleaning, Q4 volume grew 4% and sales increased 2%. Cleaning segment topline was driven by Home Care behind record quarterly shipments of Clorox disinfecting wipes, early successes of new Scentiva wipes and sprays, as well as broad-based strength across the Clorox equity portfolio. We are especially pleased with the growth of our wipes business this quarter, given we have fully lapped last year's distribution gain in the Club channel. Overall, Home Care delivered a third consecutive year of very strong market share growth, hitting 20% on a 52-week basis, its highest share in six years.","Our Professional Products business volume increased, although sales were flat following double-digit sales growth in the year ago quarter. Volume gains were broad-based with contributions from a number of recent innovations in the surface disinfecting space.","Lastly, within our Cleaning segment, laundry sales and volume declined, primarily due to category softness. Positively, however, we continue to grow our premium Clorox Splash-less Bleach resulting in share gains on total Clorox liquid bleach.","Turning to Household segment; fourth quarter volume increased 5% and sales grew 4%, reflecting strong topline growth in Renew Life, Cat Litter and Glad. Starting with Cat Litter; sales grew double-digits behind innovation and strong merchandising support. This also was the third consecutive quarter of market share growth for litter supported by our prior launch of Fresh Step with Febreze. Our Glad bags and wraps business saw solid topline growth behind ongoing success from our premium OdorShield trash bags, particularly in the Club channel, which more than offset the decline on our base business.","Although overall track channel market share for Glad was down in the quarter, we continue to see \u2013 we continue to gain share consistent with our strategy in the higher-margin premium trash bag segment and our OdorShield trash bag delivered all-time record volume in fiscal year 2017. In addition, we continue to see strong growth in non-track channels, including Club, Home Hardware, and notably, e-Commerce. Fourth quarter non-trackable shipments were flat, in line with our expectations. We continue to feel good about our plans for this business going forward and the category is on track.","Finally, we remain excited about Renew Life. Our distribution expansion plans remain on track with gains in the Food\/Drug\/Mass channel and behind dual placement strategies at key accounts as well as very strong growth in e-Commerce. We will continue to focus on expanding distribution in fiscal year 2018. And we've begun supporting this business with a new national marketing campaign.","Turning to Lifestyle; volume declined 1% and sales grew 2%. Burt's Bees delivered solid topline growth this quarter on top of double-digit topline growth in the year ago quarter. The business also drove share gains behind incremental distribution and merchandising activities in lip care. We have a strong innovation lineup for fiscal year 2018 with some of these items already on shelve.","In our Food business, volume declined slightly due to lower shipments of KC Masterpiece barbecue sauces. That said, consumption and shares in our key segments remain healthy and we are especially pleased that our Hidden Valley equity delivered a tenth consecutive quarter of share growth. To wrap up the Lifestyle segment, Brita sales were flat in Q4 as gains from innovation behind our Stream pitcher were offset primarily by strong competitive activities and a strategic choice to rationalize a lower margin part of our portfolio.","Finally, turning to International, volume and sales were up in Q4 despite more than 3 points of FX headwinds, and slower category growth in countries like Argentina and Peru due to macroeconomic trends. We continue to take pricing to offset unfavorable foreign exchange as part of our larger effort to improve margin.","Now I'll turn it over to Steve, to provide more details on our fiscal 2017 performance as well as outlook for fiscal year 2018.","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Thanks, Lisah. And we are certainly very pleased with our results in the fourth quarter and fiscal year. We're performing well in a challenging environment, delivering strong sales and earnings growth while generating healthy cash flows.","Turning to our financial results for the fourth quarter, Q4 sales grew 3%, reflecting 3 points of volume growth, which included about 1 point of benefit from the Renew Life acquisition and about 1 point of pricing, primarily in International. These factors were partially offset by about 1 point of unfavorable mix.","Gross margin for the quarter came in at 45.7%, an increase of 30 basis points, and was our highest quarterly gross margin in eight years. Contributing to the gross margin expansion were 150 basis points of cost savings and 50 basis points of pricing. These factors were partially offset by 130 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs from continued inflation, and about 90 basis points of unfavorable commodity costs consistent with the rising trends we've previously communicated.","Fourth quarter gross margin also reflected 50 basis points of benefit from lapping one-time integration costs related to the Renew Life acquisition. Selling and administrative expenses came in as expected at 12.9% of sales, compared to 14.1% in the year-ago quarter, largely driven by lower incentive compensation costs and productivity gains. Advertising and sales promotion investment levels for the quarter remained healthy at about 11% of sales, compared to 12% of sales in the year-ago quarter when we made particularly strong investments to support our brands and drive trial behind our innovation programs.","Our fourth quarter effective tax rate came in at 31.7% versus 34.3% in the year-ago quarter and included excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Now net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.53, an increase of 21%.","Now, I'll turn to our results for the full-fiscal year. Sales grew 4%, reflecting 6 points of volume growth, which included about 3 points of incremental sales growth from our innovation programs, about 2 points of benefit from the Renew Life acquisition, and 1 point of pricing benefit, primarily in International. These factors were partially offset by nearly 2 points of negative mix and about 1 point of currency headwinds.","Gross margin for the fiscal year decreased 40 basis points to 44.7% compared to 45.1% in fiscal 2016 when gross margins increased significantly at 150 basis points. Our fiscal year gross margin results reflected 150 basis points of cost savings and 60 basis points of pricing, which were more than offset by 170 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs and 60 basis points of negative mix.","Selling and administrative expenses for the full fiscal year came in at 13.6% of sales, in line with our expectations and consistent with our long-term goal to be less than 14% of sales. Advertising spending as a percentage of sales for fiscal year 2017 came in at a healthy 10% of sales. And for the full fiscal year, our effective tax rate was 31.9%. Net of all of these factors, our fiscal year diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $5.35 compared with $4.92 in the year-ago period, an increase of 9%. This, on top of an 8% increase in fiscal year 2016.","Turning to cash flow for the fiscal year. Net cash provided by continuing operations came in strongly at $871 million versus $768 million in the prior year, an increase of 13%. We're real pleased with our track record of generating healthy cash flows. This allows us to reinvest in our business with a focus on keeping our core healthy. What's also important, this allows us to return excess cash to shareholders. And we're particularly proud that for 40 consecutive years, we've been able to increase our dividend. At the end of fiscal year 2017, our debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.7, which gives us the financial flexibility to continue investing in growth and meeting our capital allocation goals.","Now I'll turn to our fiscal year 2018 outlook. As we mentioned in our press release, we anticipate sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%. As always, this reflects a number of assumptions, including about 3 points of incremental sales growth from new products, approximately 1 point of pricing and about 1 point of negative impact from foreign currencies which remain volatile.","Turning to margin. We anticipate gross margin to be up slightly, reflecting the benefits of cost savings and price increases partially offset by ongoing inflationary pressures as well as higher commodity costs. Importantly, based on our assumptions for gross margin as well as improvements across other P&L line items, we anticipate fiscal year 2018 EBIT margin to expand modestly.","Now for our fiscal year tax rate. We expect our fiscal year effective tax rate to be between 32% and 33%. As previously communicated, we continue to anticipate variability in our quarterly and annual tax rates, given the inherent uncertainty of share-based transactions. Net of all of these factors, we anticipate fiscal year 2018 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.52 to $5.72, an increase of 3% to 7%.","While it's still early in the fiscal year, I'd like to highlight a few significant trends we're actively working to address. First, we're operating in a more competitive environment. We're experiencing it in key categories, such as trash bags and litter. And the competitive dynamics in retail remain elevated. Second, we continue to be pressured by rising commodity costs and ongoing inflation. And finally, we're continuing to face challenging economic conditions within International, including a more difficult pricing environment and a longer recovery period in Argentina.","Consistent with our 2020 strategy, we're responding to these challenges by continuing to invest strongly in product and brand differentiation to keep our value proposition sharp. We're leaning into our cost savings pipeline and our productivity initiatives to support our margins. And finally, executing our Go Lean strategy in International, which emphasizes improving margins through operational efficiencies.","In closing, we're very pleased with the strong finish to fiscal year 2017. We're making the right strategic choices to support the health of our business and to continue delivering long-term value creations for our shareholders.","And, with that, I will turn it over to Benno.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Thank you, Steve, and hello, everyone. There are three things I want you to take away from this call. First, I'm particularly proud of the more than 8,000 Clorox people around the world for delivering yet another year of strong year-over-year financial results in fiscal 2017. We delivered sales growth in every quarter of the fiscal year, which is not common in an environment where growth is so hard to come by. Growth was broad-based, as we grew volume at 24 of our top 30, or 80% of our U.S. retail customers. And while our focus on traditional retailers remains core, we are seeing strong progress in e-Commerce, where sales are up ahead of our objectives at more than 30% for the fiscal year, having accelerated into the fourth quarter.","While gross margin declined modestly for the year, notably off a very strong year-ago increase, in Q4 we had our highest gross margin in eight years, driven by very strong cost savings and the beginning of a turnaround in International. And we delivered 9% diluted EPS growth and, in what is a hallmark for Clorox, we delivered another year of strong free cash flow at about 11% of sales.","Second, we continue to focus on consumer value to differentiate our products and brands in an environment where value remains king. We made great progress against what we call the Clorox Value Measure, or CVM, which reflects a combination of product performance, price and the consumers' perception of our brands. In fiscal year 2017, based on CVM, the majority of our brands are seen as superior by consumers, and this is because we place such strong emphasis on innovation, staying tight on our price gaps and continuing to invest heavily in brands that consumers love.","We continue to see strong returns on our demand creation investments, which we focus disproportionately on our profitable growth brands. In line with our strategy, digital marketing expanded from 41% to 45% of our media spending in fiscal year 2017, and we invested a healthy 10% of sales in advertising overall. And we had another strong year of innovation, delivering about 3 points of incremental sales to the top line.","Third, we have a strategy that continues to work, which gives me confidence, even in the face of what we anticipate will be a more competitive retail environment. As retailers increasingly compete based on value and competition in categories like trash bags and cat litter remains elevated, we'll continue to keep our price value sharp and to continue to invest in brand building and innovation.","We'll stay focused on margin enhancement in the U.S. and International as we aim to extend our track record of delivering 10 consecutive years of cost savings at $100 million or more and lean into the more profitable parts of our portfolio. And we remain committed to our overall strategy. And we'll share more with you in October at Analyst Day about how we're staying agile on our priorities and operating plans in the face of this challenging and ever-changing environment.","So in summary, remaining committed to our 2020 strategy means we remain committed to you, our shareholders, and creating value for you by staying the course while making the adjustments necessary to continue to deliver good growth. And that's growth that's possible, sustainable, and responsible.","Operator, you may now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, everyone.","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Good morning, Bonnie.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Morning. My question, my first one is on cost savings. I was hoping you guys could just give us a sense as to whether you still think 2% of your total addressable spending is a reasonable cost savings target? I guess also in looking at FY 2018, should we expect this to be more heavily-weighted towards COGS-related savings or more towards SG&A-related savings? And then finally, how should we expect this to ramp over the course of the year?","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Bonnie, this is Steve. Let me take that question. So a couple of thoughts about the cost savings program. We always target to get 2 points of productivity out of all of the addressable spend. I would actually tell you that we've been doing quite a bit better than that over the last couple of years. We've been getting about 150 bps of margin expansion. Now, that's across all lines of the P&L.","And I think just based on the health of the cost savings pipeline that we have, importantly, as you probably heard us on recent calls talk about stepping up our level of investment behind cost savings, I think we feel very confident that we can continue to deliver healthy cost savings well into the future and our goal for fiscal 2018 would be to deliver something in the area of 150 bps of margin expansion from those cost savings programs. You're going to have some variability across quarters, but I would say you should expect healthy cost savings in each of the quarters as we move through the year.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then in terms of your SG&A, it was 12.9% of sales in the quarter, and I guess that was a little bit lower than what we were expecting, so I'm wondering if there was any pull forward in savings that might have helped you guys meet this objective for the year that now might limit how much SG&A savings you can achieve in FY 2018. And then along those same lines, you're again guiding to SG&A at less than the 14% of net sales, so does that imply flattish SG&A or are you guys expecting to generate incremental relative savings there?","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","So just a couple of reminders. Well, first off, I was very pleased with SG&A cost coming in at 13.6% of sales for the full year. And that was very much consistent with our plans including the fourth quarter. The fact that the fourth quarter was so much lower than what you saw in the same period a year ago is a reflection of the fact that we were anniversary-ing compensation costs, which were a bit elevated last year based on the strength of our performance, both top and bottom line, but also cost savings this year.","Just from a forward-looking standpoint, I think as we've said for many years, we'd like to get that below 14%. We've done that, and I think we feel good about it. I think there's more opportunity here. It is going to take time. It's not going to happen in one quarter. It's not going to happen in one year. But I do think there's an opportunity to continue to move that number down even below the number that we just experienced in fiscal 2017, although I would say the rate of decline will probably slow a little bit from here. But I think that will be an area to contribute to future margins.","As it relates to margins overall for fiscal 2018, as I indicated in my opening comments, we do expect modesty EBIT margin expansion and I think a little of that will come from our gross margin. Some of that will come from just optimizing all of the other lines in the P&L and I think on balance, while there will be variability across the quarters, I think we should have another year of good margin expansion at the EBIT level.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. That was helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. Hi. Thank you. So I just wanted to talk a little bit about private label and how you think things have changed. So I know you've been competing successfully with private label for a long time, but are you sensing some change, especially as you have retailers like Amazon coming on that are trying to compete in specific categories?","And then are there categories where you're seeing more private label? And then how do you square the potential increase of private label with the increase in commodities at the same time? So would just love to get sort of your overall view on where you think things are going to go from here on that front. Thanks.","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Yes. Thank you, Faiza. So private label, pretty stable. Let's make that the headline. As a reminder, we compete in nine major categories and in three of those nine, private label is a major competitor, so just to put it in perspective. But as you rightly said, we've competed very well in the past against private label, and we continue to do so as you look at volumes, as you look at sales, as you look at market shares. And it's been relatively stable. Certainly, there's a lot of talk about German discounters and perhaps Amazon focusing on private label, but overall, I would characterize the situation as pretty stable and for us something that we're pretty comfortable with.","We're always watching private label, but if you look at it over a prolonged period of time, over the last decade, the gains that they've made are pretty modest, but we have also gained at the same time in an environment where value remains king for the consumer, and that's perhaps the reason why we've done so well. We keep our price gaps sharp, but importantly we keep our products differentiated and we invest in our brands, and as a result, as I mentioned in my introductory remarks, the majority of our brands is perceived as superior versus everybody in the marketplace in their categories, and as a result, we've also been able to grow household penetration on our brands.","We have gained a substantial amount of household penetration across our entire portfolio, led by the Clorox brand, and that just suggests that in an environment where certainly value, like I said, remains king, we continue to operate effectively and as long as we continue to focus on value, which is the core pillar of our strategy and perhaps the most important non-financial metric that this management team is focused on, I expect us to continue to do well.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason English from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good afternoon, folks. Thank you for let me ask a question. I guess I wanted to start with topline outlook. You have a solid year, congrats on that, but clearly, we're finishing the year with one-handles on organic sales. Your guidance implies acceleration to 3% to 5%, inflection in pricing, strong volume. It's hard to get comfortable with that in context of everything we're seeing in the industry. So help walk us through that. Maybe a bit of an outlook by segment could be helpful and some of the puts and takes that get you comfortable with the acceleration implied on the forward.","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Yes. Jason, let me give you my perspective. Now recognizing we're 30 days into the fiscal year and we're pretty early in this, we think 2% to 4% is a balanced outlook. I think it's prudent outlook. It does make a couple of assumptions that I laid out at the beginning that we're comfortable with, things like getting three points of incremental sales growth from our innovation programs, which we've been doing quite successfully over the last couple of years, and equally importantly, I think we're feeling good about the innovation we launched in 2017 that should carry over to fiscal 2018. So that's one piece of the assumption.","The second assumption is around pricing. Now, of course, we've been taking pricing in markets like Argentina and other countries with higher rates of inflation, but we're also going to take a hard look at pricing in targeted areas within the U.S. portfolio to the extent that commodities and inflationary pressures continue to remain elevated. So I think that's something else we're looking at. I would also just point out that while we are lapping Renew Life, it's in the base now, this is a business growing faster than the rest of our portfolio, and we would anticipate it should contribute modestly to the growth rate on a go-forward. And when you combine that with our Burt's Bees business, which has got momentum, our Litter business behind Febreze and some the other trends, we think 2% to 4% is a balanced outlook at this point, but let's get farther into the year and we'll take a look.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So that's really helpful, thank you. It sounds like a lot of it is predicated on getting price inflecting from negative to positive territory, clearly, right, since you're looking for plus one price. And at the same time, it sounds like you kind of need competitors to go along so we don't get some volumetric disruptions, some of these great penetration gains you've achieved, don't unwind the other way. Is there anything you're seeing in the market today that gives you confidence that competitors, the kind of environment will be conducive of that type of development?","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","To be clear, while we have built-in about a point of sales growth, more than half of that is likely to come from international. This is not a sales outlook that's contingent on pricing to be successful. It is contingent upon base business remaining healthy and growing, we're investing behind that. It's contingent upon continued momentum on the innovations. Those are the things I would point out. But I would also just call the pricing out because we are committed to protecting our margins, and I think there is some opportunities for targeted pricing. And importantly, we've got a very good track record of doing this and doing this well, and having the pricing stick market. But it's a smallest piece of the top line growth plan.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","And, Jason, this is Benno. Perhaps to build on Steve's remarks. The two things I would remind us all on that give us confidence that a selected look at pricing can be successful is, one, that we do pricing when it's cost justified, and of course cost increases is something that all the players in our categories are seeing in a similar fashion. Second, I think we are seeing now and we have remarked upon it during our introductory comments that categories from a value point of view are a little softer, volumes are still pretty healthy, but values are a little softer. And that doesn't help anybody. The least of which is retailers who are looking for category growth. And as you know, we are advising our retailers as a strategic partner on how to grow categories. And pricing and trade up continues to be a very effective way of growing the categories and retailers know that.","So while this certainly is not an easy environment to take pricing, we certainly know about price sensitivities on major brands pretty well. We know about the costs and we know about the discussions that we have with retailers pretty well. So while we don't take it lightly, we certainly think that taking a hard look at selected categories where pricing may be cost justified here in the U.S. is prudent.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Very good. Thank you, guys. I will pass it on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Powers from UBS. These go ahead.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Yes. Hey. Thanks. Maybe just following up a little bit on that. The guidance outlook you've given, obviously, has a pretty wide range of outcomes built into it. And just how would you handicap the factors that are not fully in your control? In past year, I think we all would've said the macro-environment, inclusive of commodity and FX. But it sounds like from the discussion, you know from your prepared remarks and the discussion we've had so far that maybe you're more concerned about the competitive environment, and the retailer environment be it Amazon, hard discounters or incumbent retailers and how they are reacting. Is that a fair take on the world as you see it that you're more focused on the competitive environment, maybe then the macro as opposed to in past year?","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","I have to say it's both. I would say, however, that the competitive environment has really stepped up, and across the retail landscape you're seeing the same thing we are seeing. That something we are watching closely. And that's why in our outlook this 2% the 4% sales growth, we are assuming in tracked channels, the categories are basically flat. Now let's be clear, in non-track channels, e-Commerce, et cetera it's growing quite a bit faster. But we've tried to be prudent in assuming that in-track channels it's likely to be about flat. So we are certainly watching that carefully as well as the competitive landscape.","The other thing we're going to continue to watch s foreign currency. We think it's about a point of headwinds. All we know is, it's volatile. I would point out that in a large part of the foreign currency headwinds will come from the emerging-market, including Argentina. So that's a number we will track pretty closely. And of course, commodities. Improvement played out about as we expected. We started talking about this I think almost a year ago, the fact that we thought commodities would start to increase. We are certainly are seeing it, it's something we watch carefully. So for a lot of reasons, we think the outlook for the top line is balanced.","The earnings outlook has obviously got a range on it because of currencies, commodities, and even the effective tax rate which, as we saw in the last year can move quite a bit based on share-based compensation. So, it's early in the year, seems like an appropriate balanced outlook, again, given the variables and I think we just need to get farther into the year to see how some of these things unfold.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's fair enough. As you try to make good on e-Commerce, I was wondering if we could just take a little step back and ask you to talk about how you're going after that opportunity. To what extent is there a separate e-Commerce team at Clorox versus it being integrated into each division and operating unit? My guess is that there's a bit of both going on, but if you could just talk more about how you're set up to make the most of e-Commerce and how that might vary across businesses, obviously, Burt's and Brita and Renew Life, we talked about the opportunity there is more immediate versus, say, core Glad or legacy cleaning. So just a little bit more of how you are kind of operationally going after the opportunity. Thanks.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yes, just to put it in perspective, Steve, and your instincts are pretty good on this. So e-Commerce for the fiscal year grew 30%. So we're certainly seeing an acceleration as we end the fiscal year and e-Commerce in total now accounts for 4% of the company for the first time. And if I look at the largest customer that we have in the e-Commerce space and I look at the last quarter, business almost doubled. So we certainly like where we are.","The growth is broad-based across most of our businesses. Certainly intuitive that businesses like Brita, with Brita Stream innovation, is doing particularly well. Businesses like Renew Life, but, frankly, also businesses like Glad Trash, more traditional businesses are doing very well. So broad-based and healthy and that's because we have brands that matter in e-Commerce and we are building and have capabilities and partnerships in the e-Commerce space that matter, too.","The way we're organized is that there's a separate P&L. So there is a general manager overseeing the e-Commerce activity. But it's very tightly linked to our corporate functions and very tightly linked to our business units. The corporate functions are in charge of building capabilities, in this case, capabilities that matter in the e-Commerce space. And the business units, of course, have to contribute resources and have to be very tightly strategic aligned with our e-Commerce plans.","So this is not unlike how we're operating in other fields and what this does is provide a good balance between having strong focus on the channel and building channel-specific capability, but also ensuring that whatever we do is consistent with the business strategies and, importantly, that it's profitable.","As a reminder, I think you all have heard us say before that on average, by and large, e-Commerce profitability is about in line with brick-and-mortar profitability, and that's what we care about given that we're not just after growth, but as you heard us say multiple times in the past and also today, good growth and good growth for us is profitable and sustainable.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Good morning, guys.","Lisah Burhan - The Clorox Co.","Good morning.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Benno, I want to get your perspective, I guess, on the level of satisfaction with the trade spend over the past year. And I guess I ask this in the context of a lot of discussion on the level of intensity, particularly in the U.S. at this point. And you touched on some of this. There seems to be some level of satisfaction with increases in household penetration. But with the benefit of hindsight now looking back over the past 12 months where the depth of promotion here was pretty deep, are you generally satisfied with the longer-term health of the brands?","You got seemingly the volume pickup. But now with the benefit of the past 12 months and seeing the data, are you satisfied with key performance indicators, like household penetration? Are you seeing repeat purchase rates? And I sense the answer is yes and that's what's giving you the confidence to lean in here on this 3 points of growth from innovation and new products you're looking out to fiscal 2018. But I was hoping to get your perspective there just because it seems to be a pretty hot topic in the space.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. Thank you, Kevin. Trade spend for us is not necessarily evil, but we have certainly increased our trade spend over the last few years as part of our strategy to continue to invest in our brands. We have spent a significant amount of trade to generate fast trial and awareness on innovations. And, again, if I can spend in-store on things like displays, given that trade spend goes far beyond price promotion, then that's a really good spend.","And we have done a lot of that and, as a result, our innovation has been successful. And as a result, we've expanded household penetration and we're gaining market share in most of our big and strategic categories. So can't help but feel very positive about the consumer fundamentals that we have. I want to be very clear, and we've said this in the past, we are not interested in buying volume growth or buying market share growth, but earning volume growth and earning share growth. And a strategic and smart approach to trade spend certainly is part of that.","Having said that, there are certainly categories, and we've named Litter, Glad Trash and also Disinfecting Wipes, as examples of that where we have invested perhaps more tactically and in response to heightened competitive activity. And that's simply the name of the game and always a balance to respond to competitors and make sure that we send signals that don't lead to an exacerbation of a price promotion in the marketplace. Responding in kind often is the best way of getting trade promotion to subside in the mid and long term.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Okay.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","So in a nutshell, I feel good about where we are on trade spend, but there are always opportunities to optimize. And we are a very disciplined company. We always look at ROI. The businesses and the general managers are doing that on a quarterly basis. And if there's an opportunity to improve ROIs, they will take advantage of it. And typically you will find more opportunities in buckets where you have increased spending over time. And trade spend certainly falls into that category. So I would expect that, as you would expect as well, we would see trade spend over time probably as continuing to be elevated, but also as an opportunity to be optimized.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks for that, Benno. That's helpful. Just one quick follow-up on an unrelated issue. Your portfolio is doing really well and you can see that in Nielsen data, the share trends have been positive broadly across the portfolio. One area I guess where it still struggles is Brita. And at least based on the Nielsen data, it's down double digits. Can you give us an update there? That's probably like a 20 basis point, 25 basis point drag or so on total company top line results. Is there more investment that's needed there? More innovation would you consider selling that? Or is that a potential exit? Any update there would be helpful. Thank you.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","We're seeing green shoots on Brita, but it's certainly not where it needs to be, And we've always said that this is going to take time. Again, we will earn growth, not buy growth. As a reminder, track channels, what you're seeing, accounts for less than two-thirds of sales on this category. And we're seeing certainly better performance in non-track channels. So perhaps that gives you additional perspective.","But what we've done is invest behind the brand, in particular the recent innovation, Brita Stream. And Brita Stream results are really encouraging. It's now become the number-one pitcher family. And in Q4, what you've seen is sales were flat as the lift from innovation was offset by a strategic choice that we made to rationalize the lower-margin part of the portfolio as part of our efforts to drive growth profitably.","If you just look at the core business, back on the topic of green shoots, which is poured through systems and filters and accounts for about 80% of the business, volume actually has grown mid-single digits behind this innovation. So as I look forward, we'll continue to focus on this core segment, we'll continue to invest behind the innovation, which is successful and my hope is that in 12 months from now, we'll see continued improvements on Brita. But admittedly, it's not exactly where we want it to be. But it's moving in the right direction.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Thank you very much for the time. Good luck.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, there, and thank you for taking my questions, so and congrats on the results. So following up on the comments of the increased marketing investment, the 200 basis points that you alluded in the slides and it doesn't sound to me, by the way, too high given your performance, but how do you break down in terms of trade spending against advertising? So and given incremental spend that you mentioned, and it doesn't seem potentially not incrementally in total amount, but just a better distribution of it. Why should the sales growth in fiscal year 2018 be below the long-term kind of like more the long-term algorithm of 3% to 5%? Should we see the 2% to 4% as the new long-term normal? And related to that, do you see some additional distribution gains? Perhaps some innovation as you replace faster-moving items against your core, let's say, core portfolio? Thank you.","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Okay. Andrea, you've got a couple of questions there. Let me see if I can answer each of them in turn. But let me start off with the outlook, and answer the question around 3% to 5%, which, as we have said for some time, we do believe that over the very long term is the right growth rate for the company.","Now, there's a couple of things I would point out. It presumes that the categories \u2013 this is in track channels, of course, but also untracked, grow 1% to 2%. As we said in our opening comments, as we've said subsequent, the categories are flattish, at least on a track basis. So that's certainly weighing on the results a little bit. We also have about 1 point of FX headwind built in there. So that's part of the reason you're more in the 2% to 4% than the 3% to 5%.","But again, I think 3% to 5% still feels right for the company. As far as investment, the choice between advertising or trade spending, your question seemed to allude to how do we think of that? We follow the money. We look at returns on investments. So we have significantly, over the last few years, stepped up our level of advertising.","Why? It's working. We've stepped up digital. Why? Because it's working. And we are getting the returns, and we can see the returns, both in volume and in sales and importantly in terms of profit. That's why we've been increasing it. We've also increased trade promotion spending. We brought that number up because when the consumer's ready to spend, it's great to put a situation in store where it really helps that.","So I think you will continue to see us adjust spending both in absolute as well as by mix of spending based on where the opportunities are, innovation portfolio, et cetera. But I think on balance, we feel good about the level of investment, but we will adjust that up and down and adjust the mix as needed.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And just to be clear, Steve, the 2% that you have on this slide includes both, right, trade spend and advertisement? It looks low. Or that's the 2% that you talk on the slides is everything?","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","I think to be clear, what we had talked about going back several years ago, you're not referencing the quarter or the year. I think you're referencing that several years ago as a part of our 2020 strategy, what we had said is we wanted to invest one point of incremental sales growth, call it $60 million, in incremental consumer demand building investment, whether that be trade, maybe a bit of R&D or advertising. We've gone well beyond that. And we've done that because we've had the innovation programs to invest behind, and we've done it because it's worked.","I would say today we feel very good about the level of investment. Although, as Benno pointed out, we are going to continue to really look at all of these buckets and just make sure that we are getting the highest possible ROIs for all of the spend. But, today, we feel good about the investments we have made and we are going to stay the course.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And the shelf space, lastly, sorry \u2013 just building to the growth. Do you still have some potential additional shelf space? Because what we see the TDPs (47:45) we can't really track everything. As Benno said before, a bunch of these other categories, especially the probiotics, we can't track. So you still have embedded in this guidance there is also some gains in distribution, right?","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","I think over the next couple of years, yes, we do believe there's distribution opportunities certainly with Renew Life in food, drug, mass and expanding that. We've got opportunities as we bring consumer meaningful innovation to shelf. We believe that will create opportunities for incremental shelf space. So I think the short answer is, yes.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yes, Andrea, maybe just a quick add on. I actually think that shelf space rationalization is an opportunity that's as big as shelf space expansion. What I mean by that is that a lot of retailers, among them our biggest retailer, are realizing that having more variety on shelf isn't necessarily something that the consumer rewards them for, because consumers love to have clarity at shelf and want to find the brands that they love, which happen to be market leaders quickly and without a lot of barriers.","We, of course, have a lot of those market leaders and brands they love, and we expect to benefit from more rationalized shelving, that is less cluttered and more consumer friendly, and we are seeing that with several of the customers. So I would look at that as an additional opportunity whereas perhaps less about expanded shelves, but a fewer SKUs at shelf to make consumers' shopping trip easier and make it easier for consumers to find the Clorox brands.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you, Benno, and thank you, Steve. Appreciate it.","Operator","The next question comes from Olivia Tong from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. Just wanted to follow up a little bit on levels of brands as far as fiscal 2018 goes, because as we sort of think about, first on advertising, do you expect much of a change in advertising level, you know, just the ad ratio in fiscal 2018? So that's question number one, actually.","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Well, to answer question number one, we would say the advertising level, which is at about 10% of sales in fiscal 2017, that feels about right to us. You're going to see some variability across quarters depending on what we emphasize and, of course, the number could move up or down a bit but we think that number is about right to support our brands.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Perfect. And then, so pricing is going up. It's a little bit from international to recapture FX. It's a little bit from potentially commodities, so recapture that. And then perhaps a little bit opportunistic as well. So I guess I am just trying to better understand your level of confidence in realizing all that price benefit, especially considering the backdrop of retail competition right now, which your peers are doing, particularly, your more domestic peers?","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Yes, I think the confidence level is fairly high. Keep in mind the majority of the pricing that we're anticipating is coming from international markets where we're dealing with much higher rates of inflation and it's pretty well accepted by the consumer in that area that you're going to see rising prices. And if you go back and look at the last couple of years, we've got a very strong track record of taking pricing in international. Of course, it's never easy, which is why we try to marry it up with innovation and other things we can do, but I think we feel pretty good there.","I think all we are saying is that in the U.S., as we now start to see commodity costs continue to move up on a consecutive basis, higher rates of inflation, we're going to go back, not broadly, but we're going to go back on a very selective basis and go look at where there may be some opportunities for pricing and where it's cost justified, where it makes sense, where we can marry it up with innovation hopefully. We're going to take a look at that and see if there isn't an opportunity there.","But again, our outlook for 2% to 4% contemplates a small amount of U.S. pricing. Our outlook is reliant on innovation and keeping our base healthy and driving against our growth initiatives for each of our business. It's not a pricing driven growth plan.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks. And then just on innovation, I imagine you will give us a lot more detail at Analyst Day, but is it fairly uniform in terms of the expectations across the board? Or are there certain brands that are seeing more activity this year versus prior years?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yes, Olivia, on innovation, I would say that past is a good predictor of what's going to happen in the future. Certainly, we like broad-based innovation across the entire portfolio. We also like a skew of our innovations towards what we call the growth businesses and I think that will continue.","We also like multiple year innovation platforms, so I would say there's an opportunity, the first opportunity for us, is actually to continue to invest in some of the very successful fiscal year 2017 innovations in the back half and I would name Clorox Scentiva, Fresh Step with Febreze and also Brita Stream as examples. And then as you rightly pointed out, you will get more information during Analyst Day on what this will look like. I'd also remind everybody that innovation for us typically tends to be skewed more towards the back half and this fiscal year will be no exception.","The one innovation I'd like to point everybody's attention to, perhaps, that we can talk about because it's going on right now is as we talk about differentiation and product improvements on our large brands to keep value sharp is on Clorox liquid bleach, where last month we began rolling out a new technology that we call CLOROMAX. And CLOROMAX is a patented polymer technology which for the first time in what is a 104-year-old history on the product, not just cleans surfaces but also protects surfaces, also has a laundry benefit in that it keeps laundry whiter longer.","So it's a really consumer noticeable and meaningful innovation that we'll start supporting through marketing next month and that we're excited about. And that's part of an ongoing program to keep our brands healthy and not just get into new spaces but keep core brands and core categories differentiated and deliver better value to consumers, which we continue to think, in this environment, is the right way to go.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks so much, Benno.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Just a couple of big picture questions, Benno, maybe if you can help out. Housing formation has been an important part of category growth in the businesses you compete in, as well as the unemployment rate. And those two have looked pretty good recently. And every company across the space this quarter has been talking about a weak environment. I'm just trying to maybe understand from the research you've done, what exactly is going on? What do you think is really happening with the category and the consumer?","And then the second question is when you really get out of the here and now and think about the future, disruption obviously has been coming at an accelerated pace. If you were to identify three to five things you think would really shape and evolve this industry or the industries you compete in and the way you think about your strategy, what would you call out?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yes, Nik, thank you. On the first one, yes, you look at consumer fundamentals quite positive, right? You look at the metrics, but you certainly also look at confidence, unemployment, overall spending, that's all quite healthy, which is why, as we think about our categories, consumers buy our categories. We're not seeing a malaise in the consumer at all. That's quite healthy and steady, which maybe isn't a surprise, because we mostly deal with everyday products that are somewhat indispensable and we have a lot of market leaders and we invest in them. So feel good about the consumer environment, frankly.","When we talk about a more competitive retail environment, then it's largely driven by heightened competitive activity and it's driven by retailer activity. Certainly, retailers are pushing value, right, well documented in this environment where there's retailer overcapacity, in this environment where perhaps there's a little bit of elevated anxiety around the emergence of discounters. So I would say a lot of it is driven by the players in the field and by retailers. Consumer environment, quite healthy.","Disruption, I would point at two. And those are the two that I think are also well documented. One is the retail environment, where there's overcapacity and where there's certainly speculation about perhaps more consolidation and a disruption in this space, and we'll have to see how well the said discounters will do, but I think the retailer space continues to be one that we're watching. I'll also point out that our company has continued to do extremely well no matter whether times were good or bad with retailers, and we think that it's not an either\/or world, but an and world for us, meaning that we have to do well with core brick-and-mortar customers, but also with emerging customers, for instance in the e-Commerce space and last quarter is a really great example of how we're doing that exceedingly well.","So retailers is perhaps the one disruption, and the second one that will also probably not surprise you when I mention it is technology. Consumers migrate towards technology and, of course, that means that commerce is also migrating towards technology and there will be winners and losers. And what's important for us is to continue investing, and we're doing that well, and of course the growth rates that we have on e-Commerce are a good way of letting you know that we're quite successful and we're of course also doing very well as we think about technology marketing, and that's evidenced by the fact that we now in fiscal year 2017 spent 45% of our working media dollars in digital and social, and that's up from fiscal year 2016, and I wouldn't be surprised if that's up again in fiscal year 2018.","On that note, we can also talk about the fact that we have recently started the strategic marketing partnership with Facebook, elevating the commitment that we've had with them to a strategic level. We've had a similar partnership that's been very successful and working very well for us with Google in place for a number of years now. And Facebook is next in line. And we have really great complementary capabilities that work for them and work well for us. And what that will hopefully continue to do is make sure that the ROIs that we are seeing in digital, which are very strong, need to continue to be healthy. And I think there may be even room for improvement.","So I pointed retailers and technology as the most prevalent sources of disruption. And the good news is that our strategy has provided leadership in both areas for the company for a while now, and we'll update everybody in October on how we'll keep driving that.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you, Benno.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney from Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good morning. Thanks very much. Couple of questions. First, what products, Benno, would you say \u2013 thank you for all that data. What products would you say you're selling best proportionately through e-Commerce as a whole? And outside of e-Commerce, your whole company, do you think it's fair to say as you emphasize consumer value that you're getting a disproportionate amount of growth from a higher income household maybe than you have in the past? Any insight you have around that.","And my second question is,. you've haven't had this little debt for a long time and it's never been cheaper. So does that indicate any course of action to you from a capital allocation standpoint? Does it make looking at acquisitions harder? Or are there modes of capital usage? Thank you very much.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah, I'll let Steve comment on that. And I'll take the first two, Jonathan. The best businesses on e-Commerce, I've touched upon them earlier, are businesses like Renew Life and Burt's Bees and Brita. On those businesses, e-Commerce accounts for north of 10% of sales. And if that's a precursor of things to come for the other businesses, then that's great.","But I'd also say that the growth is really broad-based. We're seeing really nice growth in our Professional business, we're seeing nice growth in trash. We have a lot of brands that resonate with consumers in e-Commerce, and I feel good about how we're driving it across the entire portfolio.","On consumer value, no, actually, your question was are we getting a disproportionate amount of growth from the higher end of consumers? No. Our brands are as relevant for less affluent consumers. We're seeing strong growth across the entire spectrum. Also, as you look at different age groups, we're seeing strong growth across various age groups, including Millennials. And that's because we're investing in the business and we're going where consumers are. And that's because we're keeping the value sharp in our categories at high price points, but also at lower price points. And we manage our business across the entire spectrum of the consumer landscape very well.","And, with that, I'll let Steve comment on that.","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Well, we're seeing the same thing you are in debt. It has been, and continues to be, fairly cheap actually. And we'll see how that unfolds over the coming years. Interest rates are anticipated to begin rising at some point. What have we been doing about it? Well, every time we've had debt come due, we've generally put debt long in the market to try to lock that into our capital structure and take advantage of it. We think it's good for shareholders. And since it's a permanent part of the capital structure, it seems to make sense to us.","If you look at the next 12 months or so, we do have some debt coming due in October. We've got about $400 million coming due. So we'll take a hard look at that and see what our financing choices are. But in terms of capital allocation priorities, those remain unchanged. We're going to continue to be disciplined in how we allocate capital, how we run this business. It's great when debt is cheap. We're certainly taking advantage of that by going long in the market with our debt placement. But it doesn't change how we think of investment decisions, which is really about investing for the long term for the benefit of our shareholders.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj from Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. I wanted to go back to top line a little bit, please. So in 2017, obviously that's 4%. Renew Life made up about 2 points, Costco kind of roundabout 1 point, or less than 1 point. So it was really more like 2% of top-line growth in 2017 without those things. 4% actually more like a 2%. So if I look forward to 2018, you're saying 3% to 5% ex-currency. You're saying the world is more competitive, but at the same time, you're saying you're trying to take pricing. And it sounds like maybe the pricing is more outside the U.S. except for strategically in the U.S.","So I'm struggling getting from 2 points up to 3 points or 5 points, unless you already have pricing locked in or you already have shelf space gains locked in. So I just struggle with that gap, especially when you say things are just tougher from a competitive perspective. And we know everything is tougher broadly from a retailer perspective as well. So just another crack at that might be helpful for me at least.","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Okay, Ali. I'll echo what I think I've said in my opening comments as well as answering the question a few times. I do think the 2% to 4% outlook we have is balanced. It's prudent. As you say, it does have a couple of assumptions. Innovation, 3 points, feel good about that.","A bit of pricing. It's not a huge amount of pricing, most of it's coming from international, but there is some pricing in there. Renew Life, no question we'll be lapping that, as I said earlier. But importantly, it will contribute to the growth rate of the company because it's growing much faster than the portfolio with attractive gross margins, I might add. So I think that's going to help us.","And then finally, it's our U.S.-based business. I feel good about the base business in the U.S. Our Burt's Bees business is continuing to do well and we've got an exciting innovation plan for 2018. Our litter business, (1:05:46), Febreze and other initiatives is doing well. Our cleaning business, particularly in disinfecting wipes, but even more broadly, continues to do well. And I'm excited by the new product launches, like Scentiva and some of these platforms we're creating.","So I think when we look at the totality of that, we believe we've got a solid plan to get into 2% to 4%. Let's see what happens with currencies. Let's see what happens with categories as we go through the year. Again, we're 30 days into it. But that's the outlook that we have and that's the business plan that we're executing against today.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So on those business plans, again, about a 3% to 5% organic is what you're aiming for. How much of it is already locked up? So do you have agreements on pricing for the year already and do you have the shelf space placements for Renew Life and others already? How much of that is actually in the bag, so to speak, versus still in negotiations for those pricing and shelf space in particular?","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Ali, I don't think we're going to get into that kind of granularity retailer by retailer, brand by brand. Again, I would say that we certainly feel good about the distribution expansion plans for Renew Life. We've been well underway with those plans for some time. We're already starting to see that distribution pick up. And as far as pricing, I think we've got a very good demonstrated track record. So I think we provided quite a bit of color to the investment community this morning around our outlook and how we're thinking of it.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I'm not asking very specifically. I'm just saying how does this stuff work. At this point, would you have pricing agreed to over the next year, shelf space agreed to over the next year? I totally get it. Don't tell me brand by brand, just in terms of the operations how this works.","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","That depends on when you take the pricing. Obviously, in the second half of the fiscal year, the answer would be no. For pricing actions in international that are bit more imminent, the answer would be yes, we've been working on it. Again, I would just reference you back to the bridges we've provided historically. And I think the track record for sales for innovation, even for distribution, is quite good. So you're just going to have to take it on faith that we've got good business plans that we're executing against it. That doesn't mean we can't be wrong on the 2% to 4% outlook. It just means it's our best estimate at this point and based on the prevailing trends that we're seeing and how we've been executing.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah, if I go back to many of your remarks over the past, I don't think our company is seen as exuberant when we look at our outlook when I go back to Steve's remarks that this is a balanced outlook that reflects confidence in our strategy. It certainly also reflects what we know is a difficult retail environment. But it's balanced. Right? It's early in the fiscal year, but it's balanced, but we feel good about the 2% to 4%.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And then just my last one, on that balance, you say in your press release and you've talked before, from an innovation perspective in 2018, three points of incremental sales and about 1 point of price increases, those are the words in the release. Just for clarity sake, is that 4% total, 3 points of incremental sales and about 1 point in price increase? Is that just 3%? And is it really balanced, quote, unquote, or is it really dependent on innovation, so we're seeing any wavering interest in your innovations at this point? That's it for me. Thanks.","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Ali, I think we're getting into too much detail, but three points is incremental sales growth on a year-over-year basis, one point of pricing best estimate, that's the net effect of the rate impact in sales that we have calculated. But with that, I think we've provided what we can provide for today. If you have other questions, we're happy to answer those.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Shannon Coyne from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Shannon Coyne - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So in looking at some data we have access to, it looks like AmazonBasics made it into the top 10 brands by bestseller share of voice on Amazon in the household cleaning supplies category year-to-date. And I was happy to see that you have two brands in the top 10. And I know you addressed private label as a whole already, and I understand that. But can you talk a little bit more specifically about your strategy to fend off Amazon specifically, given their potential increase control over search going forward? And how does that play out over time as you increase your online penetration, for example? Do you see the cost of placement with Amazon going up over time?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah, Shannon, a lot of questions in there. So I'll maybe leave it as our business with Amazon as is our business with other e-Commerce retailers. It's very strong. I surely expect private label to play a role in e-Commerce as is the case in brick-and-mortar. You've noted from my previous remarks that I feel comfortable in our ability to compete with private label. And at the end of the day, the U.S. consumer is a brand buyer, and our brands resonate very well in e-Commerce, which is why we have such strong growth rates. And which is why you noted our brands play extremely well, including in the research or survey that you suggested.","So I don't look at Amazon as a customer that's in any way different than our other customers, and I would look at that as an opportunity as well as a risk. But the opportunity far outweighs the risk, and we're taking advantage of it. We are partnering with Amazon on how to grow the categories, on how to build virtual shelves, on how to help them create a supply chain that is efficient and that works for us. So there's a lot of good news here. And we certainly are counting on that good news to continue. There's a lot of growth upside for us as a company.","Shannon Coyne - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks. That's helpful. And just one more question and then I'm done. Burt's Bees was up double-digit this quarter. Can you talk about how big you think that brand can become, and then what you're doing to gain or defend market share given the likely heightened competition going forward, given the category growth that we're seeing in the natural category. For example, The Honest Company entering Target. Would you do an M&A transaction in this category to move faster? Or can you just talk a little bit about that category? Thanks.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. So, perhaps as a clarification, Shannon, so the business, this last quarter, was up solidly off of a double-digit growth last year ago. We have talked about Burt's Bees a lot over the last few years as one of our growth SKUs and the results have certainly warranted that. We have a healthy core, and the core is growing with key customers, and we have a lot of innovation that continues to be on track. Last year's highlight was lip color; lip color's the number five brand in the category right now. It's overtaken a lot of large companies and larger brands based on a strong reception from consumers and customers.","If you think about Q4, we saw particularly strong consumption in sales in the core lip care category and strength across most key customers. So, really strong business with a healthy core, with innovation that's on track, and certainly continued plans to invest in the consumer to invest in more innovation, and you'll see some of that during Analyst Day, and continued strong focus on the core lip business knowing that we have a lot of tailwind from the consumers. So I feel really good about that, and we've had a really nice track record of growing this business for 10 years now and I don't expect that to stop anytime soon.","Shannon Coyne - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thanks.","Lisah Burhan - The Clorox Co.","I think we have one more question after this.","Operator","Yes. And our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I'm fine. We can pull the call. You've covered a lot of ground. Thank you so much.","Lisah Burhan - The Clorox Co.","Thank you.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Thank you. Thank you, all. Thanks for joining us on this call, and I look forward to seeing all of you hopefully in October at Analyst Day in New York, and to speaking with you again in November when we share our first quarter results.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Mr. Steve Austenfeld, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Mr. Austenfeld, you may begin your conference.","Steven Austenfeld - The Clorox Co.","Thank you. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining Clorox's third quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, Clorox's Chairman and CEO; and Steve Robb, our Chief Financial Officer. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet, and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com.","Let me remind you that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including, but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the financial results area of our website as well as in our filings with the SEC. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release.","Please recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.","So with that, we'll now turn to our prepared remarks. I'll cover our highlights of our third quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our financial results and outlook, and then finally, Benno will close with his perspective. And then we'll open up the call for your questions.","So let me start with our top line results. In the third quarter, we reported 4% sales growth, which is really building on the results we've seen year-to-date. And, I think it's worth noting, this is in a consumer environment, where generally growth has been hard to achieve. Helping drive these results for Clorox are the investments we've made in our brands, including in innovation, and I'll be talking more about that in a moment.","So let me start with our Cleaning segment. In our Cleaning segment, we saw third quarter volume increase 13% and sales grew 7%, and this was behind higher shipments of Home Care and Professional Products. And sales growth, while quite strong at 7%, did lag volume growth primarily due to unfavorable mix from incremental distribution in the club channel, as well as our higher investment in trade promotion in the quarter.","In Home Care, which is our largest U.S. business unit, sales increased double digits and this gain was driven by very strong volume growth, particularly from disinfecting products with record third quarter shipments of Clorox disinfecting wipes behind club channel distribution, as well as from our new Clorox Scentiva line of disinfecting wipes and sprays. These products provide an experiential fragrance while cleaning the home, and while still early, Clorox Scentiva is off to a strong start. If you look across all of Home Care, the gains in volume were really very broad-based across both channels and the entire portfolio. And this is really consistent with our results because, as we saw, the business unit delivered its 11th consecutive quarter of market share gains.","Moving to the Professional Products business, it delivered strong sales growth in the quarter with continued strength in professional cleaning, driven by Clorox disinfecting wipes, Pine-Sol and Glad, aided in part by strength in B2B e-commerce channels. And in professional healthcare, the new product we discussed with you last quarter, Clorox Fuzion, continues to run well ahead of expectations. As a reminder, Fuzion is a new cleaner and disinfectant for healthcare institutions that kills microorganisms, but with minimal residue or odor which addresses a significant need in the healthcare business.","Turning to our Laundry business, sales decreased slightly largely due to continuing softness in our Clorox 2 color-safe laundry additive business. However, our strategy for the entire Laundry business remains unchanged as we continue to trade up consumers to more value-added offerings such as Clorox Splash-less Bleach, which is doing quite well, as well as leveraging the Clorox equity across both Laundry and Cleaning, which is reflected in the success we've seen in our Home Care business.","Turning to our Household segment, we delivered 9% volume growth and 4% sales growth. Lower third quarter sales in Charcoal were more than offset by the benefit of the Renew Life digestive health business we acquired last May, as well as from higher sales in Cat Litter. Starting with Charcoal, sales and volume were down in Q3, but this was following high single-digit growth in the year-ago quarter. So simply put, we were facing some pretty challenging comparisons versus a year ago.","Looking at this year, the initial ramp-up for the summer barbecuing season was a bit slow, in part due to poor March weather, and it also skewed slightly away from our premium instant-lighting product, Match Light, resulting in an unfavorable mix impacting Q3. But, as a reminder, the bulk of our Charcoal business occurs in the fourth quarter, which is the current quarter that we're in now, and we're supporting the 2017 grilling season with our new premium Kingsford long-burning briquette that we started shipping in January.","Turning to Cat Litter, sales increased strongly, supported by all-time record shipments of Scoop Away and strong shipments of Fresh Step, primarily due to increased merchandising support, the Fresh Step with Febreze innovation, and strength in the grocery channel. And while still early, our new Fresh Step Hawaiian Aloha item, which began shipping in January, is off to a strong start. And while the category remains highly competitive, we did have our fourth consecutive quarter of market share growth for the Scoopable Fresh Step franchise.","Turning to Glad Bags and Wraps, sales came in flat for the quarter with volume down slightly, driven by a softness in our food protection business. However, our premium trash bag business, particularly behind OdorShield, continues to grow, consistent with our strategy to support retailers in trading up consumers to more value-added offerings.","And then I'll wrap up the discussion of the Household segment with Renew Life, which contributed strongly to the segment's growth this quarter. You know, in short, we remain very excited about this acquisition. Again, we made this acquisition about a year ago, this month. And we continue to be focused on distribution expansion strategy. That remains on track, and we feel very optimistic about future distribution opportunities.","Turning to our Lifestyle segment, volume decreased 1%, and sales decreased 3%. And the slight decline in volume was primarily driven by lower shipments in Water Filtration and Natural Personal Care, reflecting comparisons to double-digit volume growth in both businesses in the year-ago quarter.","So, starting with our Brita water-filtration business, despite the sales and volume decline due to tough comps, again, particularly on our faucet mount products, our Q3 shipments this year on our pour-through systems and filters increased behind our latest wave of innovation, and specifically that was on a couple of products launched in mid-February. At that point, we started shipping our new Brita Stream Filter As You Pour Pitcher, which makes filtering water ten times faster, as well as our premium Brita Longlast Filter, which lasts three times longer than legacy filters and reduces more contaminants, including removing 99% of lead.","Looking at Burt's Bees, Q3 sales and volume declined in comparison again to double-digit volume gains in the year-ago quarter as we lapped the launch of Burt's Bees lipsticks. At the same time, our lip balm business continues to perform very well with record third quarter shipments. And looking ahead to fiscal year 2018, we have strong plans in place for innovation in several areas to keep growing this business.","Turning to our Food business, sales decreased and volume was flat for the quarter as we made significant incremental investments in March that are anticipated to contribute meaningfully to fourth quarter volume growth in support of new products. And these include Simply Ranch, a preservative-free offering in our original ranch lineup, and two new flavors of ranch, chili lime and cucumber basil. We're also leveraging the strength of the Kingsford brand, our Charcoal brand, by launching a new line of barbecue sauces.","And then finally looking at our International business, sales increased 3%, while volume declined 2%. The modest volume decline was mostly due to lower shipments in certain Latin America countries, notably Argentina, driven by macroeconomic conditions. Partially offsetting this were increased shipments in Canada, which benefited from the Renew Life acquisition.","And broadly speaking, although macroeconomic conditions remain tough, we are encouraged by the progress in our International business as our go-in strategy to improve profitability is also providing for selective investments in key markets which will support future top line growth. For example, in recent quarters, we have launched laundry innovations in several international markets that are off to a good start, including in Asia and Latin America.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Steve to provide more detail on our Q3 performance and financial outlook.","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Well, thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. We're pleased to deliver another strong quarter of both volume and sales growth. And importantly, as we indicated in our press release, we're on track to deliver solid sales and earnings growth for the full fiscal year.","Now, turning to our financial results for the third quarter, third quarter sales grew 4% reflecting 7 points of volume growth, including nearly 3 points of volume contribution from the Renew Life acquisition and 1 point of benefit from pricing in International, mainly in Argentina.","These factors were partially offset by nearly 3 points of unfavorable mix and over 1 point of higher trade promotion investment to support our innovation programs. Gross margin came in at 44%, a decrease of 130 basis points, compared to a 210-basis point increase in the year-ago quarter. As always, we provide details on our gross margin drivers in a supplemental schedule that's a part of our earnings release.","What I'll focus on now is our perspective on third quarter results, and what we're anticipating for the full year. Third quarter gross margin was lower than anticipated, primarily from the impact of negative mix in our Charcoal business and strong performance in the club channel across multiple businesses. All other assumptions for third quarter gross margin played out as we anticipated.","Turning to the full year, we anticipate fiscal year gross margin to decrease modestly, reflecting ongoing inflationary pressures, firming commodity prices, unfavorable mix, and negative foreign currencies. In addition, fiscal year gross margin reflects higher trade investments to support product innovation.","These factors are expected to be partially offset by the benefit of cost savings and pricing. Longer-term, improving gross margin continues to be a priority, and we certainly feel good about our strong track record of delivering meaningful cost savings year-after-year. We have pricing power from leading brands, and we'll continue to invest in the more profitable businesses in our portfolio.","At 13.6% of sales, selling and administrative expenses were lower than the year-ago period, and we continue to anticipate fiscal year expenses to come in below 14% of sales. Advertising and sales promotion spending was up $15 million with total spend nearly 11% of sales, reflecting continued strong support for our U.S. business and select growth opportunities in International.","Our effective tax rate was 30% versus 33% in the year-ago quarter, reflecting excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.31, an 8% increase versus year-ago, this on top of 12% growth in the year-ago quarter.","Turning to net cash provided by continuing operations, year-to-date cash flow came in at $483 million, an increase of nearly 11% versus the year-ago period.","Now, on to our fiscal year 2017 outlook, we continue to anticipate fiscal year sales growth in the range of 3% to 4%, reflecting solid sales results to-date and the strength of our innovation program. Our updated sales outlook also reflects about one point of negative impact from foreign currencies with most of the impact having occurred in the first half of the fiscal year.","We continue to expect the advertising and sales promotion spending to be about 10% of sales, and we anticipate fiscal year EBIT margin to increase roughly 25 basis points from lower selling and administrative expenses.","In addition, as previously communicated, we'll be lapping a number of items in the fourth quarter, including integration costs related to the Renew Life acquisition, the negative mix effect from distribution expansion of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes in the Club channel, and a return to more normal levels of performance-based incentive compensation costs. As we move through the balance of the year, we'll also be closely monitoring how the charcoal season unfolds.","Turning to our fiscal year tax rate, we continue to anticipate our fiscal year tax rate to be between 32% and 33%, and, as previously communicated, we continue to expect ongoing variability in our quarterly and annual tax rates. Net of all of these factors, our fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $5.25 to $5.35, an increase of 7% to 9%.","As we look beyond fiscal year 2017, we'll continue executing our strategy in what remains a very challenging operating environment. First, recognizing the high level of competition in several U.S. categories and the intensifying competitive dynamics in retail, we'll continue to invest behind our brands to support our categories and maintain the help of our core business.","Next, in light of continued, slowing international economies, executing our Go Lean strategy remains a priority with an emphasis on long-term margin improvement through productivity gains and select margin-accretive growth initiatives.","And finally, as we previously communicated, commodity prices are increasing and inflation will remain for the foreseeable future. We'll continue to maintain a healthy cost-savings pipeline, invest in more profitable businesses in our portfolio, focus on lowering SG&A costs as a percentage of sales, and take pricing as needed to protect our margins.","In closing, we feel good about our results in the third quarter, and we're on track to deliver solid sales and earnings growth for the full fiscal year. Importantly, we believe that strong execution against our strategy and a sharp focus on what we can control will help us continue creating solid shareholder value over the long-term.","Now I'll turn it over to Benno.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Thank you, Steve, and hello, everyone, on this 104th birthday of The Clorox Company. As I round out our prepared remarks, there are three things I want to share with you today. First, we're pleased to have delivered continued strong volume and sales growth this quarter in an environment where growth is so hard to achieve. This was our fourth consecutive quarter with 7% or greater volume growth.","Our focus is first and foremost on the health of our core business by offering superior value to consumers behind strong brand investments and innovation. And the robust innovation we launched in the first half continued to be a key driver of volume and sales growth in Q3 with several new products off to a strong start, including Clorox Scentiva wipes and sprays and Brita Stream pitchers.","And with marketing support now turned on for most of our new products including Hidden Valley Simply Ranch and Kingsford Long-Burning Charcoal, we feel good about the outlook for innovation in our fourth quarter as well.","We also continue to feel good about Renew Life, which contributed two points to sales growth this quarter. Yesterday marked the one-year anniversary of the acquisition of this business, and I'd like to take a moment to recognize all the people across our company who have made the integration of this business so smooth and successful and who are driving distribution and market share.","In Q3, our International business also continued the upward trend we started to see in Q2. We delivered another quarter of strong profit growth with our Go Lean strategy behind price increases and cost savings which include the sales of a distribution facility as our team continues to focus on improving profitability.","The next point I want to emphasize is that we continue to have confidence in our strategy, which gives us quite a bit of resilience in what remains a difficult environment. Here are a few examples; it has been widely discussed that to attract consumers, retailers have become very competitive, focusing on price and value for their shoppers.","And as a result, what we're seeing from a category standpoint is that dollar and volume growth have been roughly the same in recent periods. And this clearly is a change from the last few years where price increases in our categories resulted in dollar growth exceeding volume growth. Importantly, however, it's our view that consumers are not buying fewer items. They're just buying at lower price points. And fundamentally, we believe our categories are healthy.","From a Clorox standpoint, we therefore plan to stay the course with our strategy to invest in brand building behind superior products and innovation with the intent to deliver better value for consumers and to spur category growth for our retail customers.","It's also important to note while our focus on traditional retailers remains very important to us, we're seeing very strong gains in our on-track channels such as with some of our institutional health care, Burt's Bees lines, and Renew Life probiotics lines and in some of our on-track channels such as Club, Home Hardware, Pet Specialty, and eCommerce. And regarding eCommerce, technology continues to transform the way consumers shop our categories and we believe that our focus on leading this technology transformation will continue to be a competitive advantage for the company. Case in point, eCommerce sales are up 30% fiscal year-to-date and our digital marketing investments continue to deliver strong ROIs.","In addition, our strategy helps us weather macro impacts over time, such as rising commodity costs which, as noted last quarter, are now becoming more of a headwind. In response, we'll continue to lean into cost savings, SG&A productivity programs, and the more profitable parts of our portfolio to support our margins.","All that said, my third point is that we remain confident we can continue to create solid shareholder value over the long-term. We remain committed to maintaining strong brand building investments as we continue driving household penetration, engaging with consumers in provocative and captivating new ways, and launching consumer preferred innovation across the portfolio. We'll continue to drive our business with core customers and in eCommerce channels supported with strong digital marketing execution.","We'll continue leading into our Renew Life acquisition to capitalize on distribution expansion opportunities in the fast-growing digestive health category. And we'll also continue to drive cost savings and productivity programs in the U.S. and in International and we'll also leverage our pricing power where appropriate over the long-term. So in this challenging environment, I remain confident in our strategy.","And with that, we'll open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Dorer. We'll go to Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Thanks for the question. Good afternoon, guys. First question, Benno, just on the guidance for the year, organic sales growth now. So it looks like the midpoint of your guidance implies about 2.5% growth at the midpoint, but given about 3.5% year-to-date, it would seem to suggest a deceleration about half a point of growth in the fourth quarter. So, if you could just confirm that and some of the drivers behind it?","And then related to it, of course, there's been a lot of discussion, some of which you touched on, with some of the weakness that we're seeing in the U.S. in a difficult retail environment. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in April? The Nielsen data we're looking at suggests that industry growth for you has gotten a little bit better but still negative, so maybe you could comment a little bit on what you're seeing so far quarter-to-date? And then what's implied in your guidance for industry growth here for the balance of the year. Thanks.","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Kevin, this is Steve. Let me start off. You've got a couple of questions there. First, in terms of our sales outlook for the year, as we said in the press release and our opening comments, we anticipate 3% to 4% sales growth for the full fiscal year. And I'm certainly very pleased that we're at the upper end of that fiscal year-to-date. I think as you look to the fourth quarter, a couple things I would point out. Number one is we're going to begin the process of lapping the acquisition of the Renew Life business.","That, for the full-year, is expected to deliver about two points of incremental sales growth for the company. But again, we'll start lapping that as we go into the fourth quarter. We're also going to start lapping the expansion of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes into a major club store customer in the fourth quarter. So I think on balance, when you run the math, we'll see where we come out. But it's possible as we start to anniversary that, the growth could be a bit lower in the fourth quarter just because we're anniversarying some of those items. I'll let Benno take your next question.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yes. So on categories, look, in Q3, our U.S. business was up 9% in volume. And that's, I would say, puts us, you know, in a position to be well positioned relative to our competitors. Shares are steady. Volumes in our categories are steady and, frankly growing, so the categories remain quite healthy. And I would call our business in the U.S. on track. What we're watching per our introductory remarks is category value as consumers migrate towards more value and as retailers compete with each other more based on pricing. And that's something that we're certainly focused on, and we're also focused on non-track channels.","A lot of the growth right now comes from non-track channels and that business, frankly, is very healthy as we think about eCommerce, as we think about club, home hardware, the institutional channel, dollar, new channels, convenience stores, others. We feel like we have a tremendous amount of growth opportunity in non-track channels that we're taking advantage of.","So I would call our categories quite healthy and, frankly, resilient. What we need to make sure is that the volume growth that we're seeing in our category continues to translate into strong dollar growth and we're doing that by investing in the more profitable parts of the portfolio and the higher dollar ring parts of the portfolio, which includes innovation, and we're doing that by maintaining the strong brand investments that we have started to put in about two years ago. So all-in-all, I would say in a very difficult environment, the business remains on track, and the categories are, frankly, quite steady.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Thanks, Kevin.","Operator","We'll go next to Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. Just following up on that, I mean, you guys obviously continue to drive strong volume growth, but it is coming now with the help of even more in price promo mix. So I guess two questions. First, is it really driving any incremental consumption by consumers or any new consumers into the category? Not just for you, but also for the category as you think about the retail, the pressures from retail? And is there any concern that all this promo is really just pushing consumers to stock up more and that it'll come to sort of hurt later on? And then, second, what happens now that raw material prices are going up? How do you think that's going to impact promotional levels for both you and your competitors?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yes, thanks Olivia. A lot packed into those questions. So first thing, what we said is that price, our trade promotion dollars which clearly have been tracking up in line with what we've communicated in the past, they're going after two things. First of all, there are a selected number of categories where we are responding to an increase in competition, and I would say Wipes and Glad trash are two examples where we're responding in kind to make sure that our categories and our business remains healthy long-term.","We've also said that we're not afraid to do that even if it hurts the profitability of one quarter because we're putting these spending plans in place with an eye on the long-term health and profitability of the business and we continue to do that. That's something that we're doing quite well.","The big buckets of where our trade promotion dollars go is innovation, and we've also said in the past and continue to believe that these are strategic investments that build our brand equity because they increase speed to shelf and because they get these innovations off the ground. As you know well, we have a lot of innovation and an environment that is clearly innovation starved, and we're leveraging that. And as a result, several of the innovations, as we've indicated in our introductory remarks, like Clorox Scentiva, like Brita Stream, like Kingsford long-burning charcoal, like also the Clorox Fuzion in the institutional channel are doing really, really well. And that, of course, bodes well in the long run.","To your question as to whether this will have a long-term positive impact, beyond the innovation that it helps, I would ask that we perhaps look at household penetration. As you know, we're very much focused on driving household penetration. We have grown household penetration on our brands once again last quarter. We now have 80% of our sales either growing or with stable household penetration in an environment where many brands are losing household penetration. A lot of our brands are growing household penetration, and a percentage of our sales that's growing household penetration is 2x of the percentage of sales that was growing household penetration three years ago. So what that tells you is that this trade promotion spend, as part of our total spending plan, is leading to access to more consumers, and that in the long run is the best way to grow brands profitably.","On the raw materials front, no news, really. I would say commodities have become more of a headwind, and what we've said in the past is that we would expect that the promotional environment would ease up over time. We still expect that, but there's a time lag, Olivia, and I think that'll take a few quarters. We expect that to continue to be elevated for a while, but if history repeats itself, which it has over the years, then we can expect that to become better in the mid- and long-term. Encouragingly, though, even though we're losing some share in Glad trash which is most affected by this, which is a calculated move on our side, we continue to be encouraged by the fact that the premium end of the business with OdorShield, where the heart of our strategy is because that's where the profit pool is, is continuing to be doing quite well and is actually growing.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Appreciate the color, Benno. Just one follow-up. I noticed on your price sheet that there's no raw materials-related pricing plans yet. Is it just not enough yet to warrant a move? Or is that just a function of all the factors within the environment that we're talking about right now?","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","I think it's just very early, Olivia. Keep in mind, we've been enjoying tailwinds for actually a couple of years now and we just started to see the headwind in this quarter, and I think what we'll need to see is sustained increases in raw material pricings for some period of time at a level that's high enough to justify pricing. So I think this will take a couple of quarters to see if the trend continues to play out this way. I think what's important to note, though, is we've got leading brands. They're very strong.","So as we've experienced before, if, in fact, we start to experience a real margin squeeze associated with this, we're not afraid to take pricing. It sometimes means we lose a little volume in the short term; it tends to come back, but we're not afraid to take pricing to protect the margins, but this is the first quarter of headwind, so I think we need a few more quarters to see how this plays out.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And we'll go next to Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. Hi, everyone.","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Hey, Bonnie","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I had a follow up to some of the commentary around the club-channel. How should we think about gross margins as you start to lap some of the distribution gains there? And then, separately, can you give us a sense as to how your new Scentiva products are impacting your gross margins?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","So maybe the Scentiva first. The large majority of our innovation is margin accretive to their categories, and we should be thinking about Scentiva as one of the products that falls into that camp, and, as we've noted, that's off to a really nice start both in wipes as well as in sprays, and we're pretty bullish about this being a future innovation platform.","Now, the club business, what we've noted is somewhat of a trade-off. Some margins generally are a bit lower than our average margins, but it's better to be in club than club shoppers buying your competitors in that channel, and being the only game in town on wipes in club has certainly been a very good initiative for us that's importantly been instrumental in the wipes business, gaining access to full points of incremental households over the last year since we started being back in club.","So feeling good about being in club, but we have now, in Q4, fully lapped that distribution and certainly what Steve had noted is that the club business, the particular strength that we've had, in particular, also driven by wipes, has been somewhat of a headwind for us margin-wise, and we have now fully anniversaried that, and that's certainly something to take into account as we think about margins for our business going forward.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for that. And then I was hoping to get a little more color on your trade promo spending that pressured your gross margins in the quarter. How much of the increase is due to investment behind innovation versus in response to competitive pressure? And then curious, how much pressure are you guys getting from retailers to possibly share in some of the price investments that they've been making? And, I guess, I'm getting the sense that this must be intensifying.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","The split question first, Bonnie. I don't know that we break that out for you, but, like we've said earlier and like we said in the past, it's a mix. More broadly speaking, our focus is on supporting our innovations, and I would like to remind everybody that trade promotion doesn't necessarily mean pricing. It can go into displays and other value-added activities, which is certainly our focus, but then there are a few categories, and we've in the past noted wipes, Glad trash, and also cat litter, which is doing really well, where the competition is quite intense, and where we're responding in kind to some of our competitors' activities. So I would say it's a mix.","On the pricing activity that you mentioned, we have a fair and equitable pricing policy, which means that all retailers qualify for the same pricing, and we do not favor any retailer, big or small, on that. So if retailers choose to make price investments on our brands, we are not supporting that because, again, we're handling our business with a long-term eye on profitability, we'll treat all customers fair and equitably, and we also know that most of our brands don't see an increase in consumption if pricing is lower so we're certainly focused on protecting the pricing integrity of our business and because we're category managers for most of our categories with most retailers and we're advising retailers on their strategies on how to grow our categories profitably, that's certainly a component that we're very focused on and that we're stressing in all our conversations that we have with retailers.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thank you. Good afternoon. I just want to \u2013 and I'm sorry to go back to the same questions that we are all asking. I mean, in terms of your top-line growth, which obviously was quite impressive in this competitive environment. But \u2013 so could you help us bridge the kind of channel neutral, if you will, of this promotion, let's say? Or is it mostly because you've gained distribution? So you've got all this volume and you've gained distribution not only at Costco or online or more shelf space in some of the categories where you're gaining market share? Or you have more innovation? So I was just trying to see on a same-shelf-space basis or a same-door basis, how much more spending are you incrementally having in promotions? So how much of that is \u2013 or are you seeing that coming off of a quarter and you're seeing that intensifying, going back to Bonnie's question, as you go into a more difficult environment? Thank you.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","So, Andrea, I mean, clearly if you think about the \u2013 let's talk volume growth. So a lot of the volume growth clearly is in non-tracked (40:02) channels, but that's because consumers are increasingly buying in non-tracked (40:06) channels. And we realize you guys don't see that, but what it speaks to is the strength of our business in those channels and that's not by happenstance but that's because we're investing in innovation, we're investing in assortments and we're following the consumer.","If you think about where the growth is, it's in eCommerce. eCommerce fiscal year-to-date is up 30%. If you think about where the growth is, it's in club because consumers migrate towards club. Why? Because club offers better value and we're driving a lot of growth because we have strong brands. Home hardware is the same. If you look at the home hardware channel as is well publicized, it's doing really well, and we're investing, and that's delivering strong returns. If you think about Professional Products, which again is up 7% off of 17% in the year-ago quarter, we're investing in that channel. The dollar channel, if you think about what we said in the past about our focus on $1 SKUs which we have launched last year and which are contributing about 0.5 point of growth to our company, that speaks to the consumer trend of affordability which we're addressing very, very well.","So we are focused on driving our categories and our brands the right way and with a long-term view. And as a result, we're driving growth in those channels through certainly strong investments in things that drive our brand equities in expansion of assortment, in innovation, and in overall health of both new SKUs as well as existing SKUs, but the right way and with the long-term view. So that is what's happening here, and that's what's driving the growth that we've had. You've noted that we have growth in an environment where few companies do, and that is deliberate and based on strategy.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","No, that's helpful, Benno. But just on the existing, let's say, the Walmarts, the FDM, you're still \u2013 you're not worried about like the level of inventory. You don't see that they're overstocked relative to the consumer take-away.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","First of all, always worry about Walmart. They're 26% of our business, so we always focused on making sure that that business is healthy, which it is. And frankly it's been healthy for a long time and we feel good about that. Why is it healthy? Because we're doing exactly what I just said. We're investing with them in activities that drive category growth, and we're keeping our value sharp on our brands through innovation and brand building, and we're rewarded by Walmart for that. Walmart's very good at operations, of course, and very good at managing their inventory. A lot of it is done electronically, so we have not seen an uptick in inventories. We have not seen anything unusual there. So our business with Walmart and other customers is pretty sound, and we're working with them to keep it that way.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Perfect, Benno. Thank you very much, and congrats.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Thanks, Andrea.","Operator","We'll go to Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. A few questions. One back on gross margin, clearly, a little bit weaker. You've talked through commodities, manufacturing, logistics, as well as mix now and, of course, trade spend. And if you take gross margin and you correlate it to your stock price, it actually ties very much to your stock price, at least historically it has. So if your gross margin goes down, your stock does as well. So what's your outlook on each of these dimensions, especially on the mix and trade spend drivers of gross margin? Because it certainly sounds from discussion set (43:51) that the ability to take price will be a little bit more curtailed going forward. So if you can talk about, particularly, around mix and trade spend which you do have an eye into, that would be helpful.","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","So, Ali, as you know, in August of every year, we provide our outlook, and we'll certainly do that this year and provide you an outlook for fiscal 2018. I can give you some directional indicators, at least, based on what we know today about gross margin. First, I would just say that we do believe we have plans in place over the long-term to expand gross margins, not to say that you can't have variability across the quarters or even years. Of course you can.","But we feel good about our plans. That said, our cost savings, we continue to feel like we've got a very healthy pipeline and we target to get 150 bps of margin expansion. That's all in. Some of that goes to gross margin, some goes to other lines, but we're feeling good about that.","Pricing is an area we're keeping a sharp eye on. As you know, and as you can see in our web attachments, we've been taking pricing primarily in International, it's working. And I think you'll likely see us continue to take pricing in International and we'll have to make a determination at a future date whether pricing is \u2013 makes sense and it's cost justified in our U.S. business but certainly over the long-term with the strength of our brands, we're not afraid to take pricing if we need to.","Commodity prices, as we have said for some time, I think that's going to turn into a headwind, and I think it will likely continue to be a headwind at least for the next few quarters, absent some event that we can't see, so started in the third quarter. I think you'll see it continued to be a headwind through the fourth quarter and beyond. And then I think everything else, manufacturing, logistics, you'll have some ups and downs across the quarters but you'll continue to have headwinds.","As it relates to trade spending, we have \u2013 I do want to point out that we stepped that up pretty significantly in the third quarter. This was long planned. This is something we built into our plans at the beginning of the year. This is not in response to recent events. And this was really designed to do innovation. And I would also just call out that we're trying to better balance our third quarter and fourth quarter spending, so while third quarter advertising and trade spending was up significantly, and for good reason, fourth quarter, I think, you'll see those numbers come down a bit versus the year ago period. And again, that's a conscious choice on our part. So in short, feel good about the margin expansion plans. Just seeing variability across the quarters, but I think we've got good plans and we're executing well.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","And, Ali, building on this point, just putting gross margin into perspective, I think what we said, clearly, the 130 basis points versus a year ago is something that we have discussed. But versus two years ago, it's up 80 basis points. Versus three years ago, it's up 190 basis points. So hopefully that puts one quarter into perspective. As you know, we manage our business for the long-term. I would add to Steve's point on pricing that while, clearly, taking pricing in an environment like this is not easy, we do know that we still have pricing power. Pricing sensitivities are about the same as they were one year, two years, three years ago. So that feels good. And we also know that the majority of our sales enjoys a perceived value superiority by our consumers, which again speaks to the fact that we have an opportunity here should we need it down the road. And we're perceived to have superior brands because we have innovation, because we put investments in, and because we have a disciplined pricing that keeps price points sharp. So we have a toolbox to grow gross margin even in a more difficult environment, clearly.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","That's helpful. And just in terms of, kind of, related to that and the drivers of top line growth you have seen so far, clearly, it's been price and volume the past several years. As you go forward, it does seem like your ability to take price might be a little bit curtailed, given everything we've all talked about from an Aldi, from Amazon, from Walmart in terms of not just pure pricing pressure but increased private label, right, whether Aldi is successful or not, Walmart's ramping up private label. Aldi, if it is successful, will ramp up private label. Clearly, Amazon RFP'ing on private label across the board.","And you guys are quite prone to that and you have been historically successful, but the price gap has no option but to expand between private label and you despite all the innovation that you're going to be doing and you have been doing. So I just wonder, from the drivers of top-line growth perspective, is price going to be an element of it going forward? And in particular, within the past year, obviously, M&A with Renew Life and distribution growth on wipes have been greater drivers than underlying growth. Are there more opportunities there that you think M&A-wise and distribution potential that could overshadow some of the past difficulties that I'm suggesting on price? Thanks, guys.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yes. A lot packed in there. I would say, I don't know that our drivers of sales growth going forward will look dramatically different than what they look like in the rearview mirror. It is innovation. Innovation is margin accretive. Innovation tends to be more at the higher end of the spectrum. It is, therefore, trade up. It is shifting the investment mix towards faster growing categories; digestive health, of course; natural personal care, the institutional channel, e-commerce. We have systematically shifted our investments towards those more profitable, faster-growing areas of the business, and those will all continue to yield results as you've taken away from our previous remarks. Our categories are quite healthy.","There is a slight downward pressure on pricing, but as retailers clearly also become sharper and will compete with, or will try to inoculate themselves against discounters, what that will do is it will take categories further down, and what you need, therefore, is you need premium price market leaders, and, as you know, more than 80% of our portfolio is a premium-priced market leader, and we expect that to be frankly an opportunity for us in the marketplace. I followed discounters for 25-plus years when it all started in Germany, and what's happened is an increasing bifurcation in the marketplace. Market leaders win; private label wins; number three, four, five brands, most of them medium-priced in categories, lose their reason for being because they're trade down from premium brands and because they are trade away profit-wise from private label. So I look at that frankly as certainly something that we're watching, but mainly also an opportunity for our brands because retailers then, in the future, more than ever will need premium-priced brands, strong brands, backed by innovation to grow categories. Private label does not grow categories. So I look that as a good thing for us, and frankly, somewhat of a tailwind.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","We'll go next to Jason English of Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Benno, you mentioned in your prepared remarks the strong volume growth four quarters in a row, the penetration gains. It's definitely impressive, but it's clearly coming with a pretty hefty price tag in terms of the price-mix drain. Is that just the reality we're living in today? To chase this type of growth, we're going to have to suffer that price-mix degradation? Is it something that's a bit more transitory? And why shouldn't we be concerned that that price-mix line is building as a more substantial negative at the same time, that the commodity inflation has inflected, as you point out, likely going to continue to climb from here?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yes. I mean, the best way, Jason \u2013 thanks for the question. I would answer this it that (52:14) let's keep focusing on the long-term. Any given quarter, sometimes our numbers are up, sometimes they're down, but if you look at the fiscal year, we've driven 3% to 4% sales growth, 7% to 9% earnings growth this environment. It's the third consecutive year of really solid value creation for our shareholders, and that's perhaps something I would keep in mind.","What it tells you is that we are not afraid to make choices within any given quarter that allow us to profitably grow the business with the long-term eye on it, and that's all there is to it, and we're doing it the right way by focusing on the ROI on our spending, by focusing on penetration and market share, by focusing on innovation that is margin accretive, and will provide for future growth, by focusing on driving faster-growing categories. It's disciplined, it's strategic and it's with an eye on the long-term. Is it more difficult to grow the business profitably when commodities costs are up and when retailers like to compete with each other? Yes. But I'll also tell you that our track record of competing in this environment is frankly pretty formidable, and if you look at the financial crisis or other situations like this, again, this is not new. We have done this pretty well. And you know what? It is time for us is to activate some of the things that we've done pretty well in the past. Some of them we've talked about today.","Our costs savings program continues to be very strong. Our focus on investing in the premium ends, more profitable ends of the business is working. We talked about pricing in international and should we need it over time, perhaps in the U.S. SG&A productivity. There's a lot of things that we're doing that we can continue to activate in the future so that I feel pretty confident in our ability to add value to our shareholders in a meaningful way in the long run.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful. One other way you've add some value and driven some growth is through some pretty smart acquisitions in the last couple of years, or at least they seem to have been. As you think about the pipeline out there, the market environment, are there opportunities out there that you see to go out and buy more?","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Hi, Jason. This is Steve. I would say, we're always looking at our pipeline, and it still remains more of a seller's market than a buyer's market, but we're actively looking at lots of different opportunities in different spaces. But our number one priority will continue to be driving organic growth, healthy growth on our base business. But to the extent that we can find, not just good businesses, but good deals at attractive prices, we certainly have plenty of cash flow and available resources to be able to execute on it. But it's pretty hard to plan for that. So we work it all the time, but our number one priority is to keep driving hard against our base business and keep that innovation pipeline healthy.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Very good. Thank you, guys.","Steven Austenfeld - The Clorox Co.","Thanks, Jason.","Operator","We'll go next to Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Edge Research.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thanks very much. Benno, you made a comment earlier in the call about you're a one-price company. I know there's some relevant rules and legislation about that that everybody has to follow, but I know you're also free to set certain volume or dollar-level incentives for sizes of the shipments or whatever that functionally give some customers, everybody to get the opportunity to do a lot of volume, but functionally, give some customers have a better chance of getting to those volume incentives than others. I guess my questions are, are you saying that Clorox doesn't work that way?","That in fact your volume \u2013 you'll offer the same levels of price that (56:16) will offer those incentives at different levels? And does maybe trying to \u2013 does it ever happen that trying to work with the needs of one retailer, as far as volume incentives and shipments, lead to unintended consequences across other areas? And my second question is just about e-commerce. Is your share in e-commerce approximately the same as your share offline in the categories where you do participate? And can you give us a sense how big that is of your business? I didn't hear that before. Thank you very much.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yes. Thanks, Jonathan. So, first of all on a pricing policy, we do not comment on specifics on the price policy and certainly not on specific conversations that we have with retailers. All I can do is reiterate that our pricing policy is fair and equitable, and all customers have the ability to qualify for the same pricing. On e-commerce, we don't have good and reliable share data, I will say, so the industry is still working on that. What we do know is that the business is up 30% fiscal year to date.","In Q3, for instance, the business with our largest customer in e-commerce is up 75%, which tells you that trends are quite healthy. And for the first time, e-commerce now is north of 3% of sales in our company. What we have said is that we would like this business to be $300 million in size by the year 2020, and we're frankly slightly ahead of that and working towards upsides against that goal. So feeling good about e-commerce. Why? Because our capabilities that we have translate very well, because we have leading brands that matter to consumers in the e-commerce space and because we have, frankly, started talking about e-commerce years ago when this wasn't a hot topic in our industry just yet. So we feel like we've built a competitive advantage that we're putting to work now.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","And we'll go next to Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. Hi. Thank you. So I just had two questions. One is on Burt's Bees. So I know the business declined because of the prior-year comp, but can you talk about the consumer take-away trends in that business? And then secondly, I just wanted to ask about the other income. So I know there's $10 million from the gain on sale that you had talked about. What's the incremental $6 million? Thank you.","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","So, Faiza, let me take the second part of your question first. So for other income and expense, as you can see, it's a pretty large change. The biggest driver is what we communicated in the previous earnings call, which is we sold a piece of real estate in Australia as a part of our Go Lean operations in International, where we're trying to not just build margins and improve productivity, but take a little bit more of a go asset-light model. So that threw off again a little bit more than $10 million. The rest is a lot of puts and takes, just a lot of small items that collectively add up to a number. So there's not much more to it than that.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yes, and on Burt's Bees, Faiza, welcome. We have in Q3 lapped the lip-color launch a year ago, which was a particularly big innovation that we launched in Q3. So we went up against not only double-digit volume growth in Q3 of last fiscal year, but also double-digit volume growth in Q2 of fiscal year 2017. So the reality is we're beginning to lap tougher quarters, double-digits growth quarters, but the reality also is that we continue to feel very good about this business. We're continuing to grow market share. The core lip business displayed record-high shipments in Q3. We're supporting innovation with advertising in Q4.","And importantly, we're going to launch significant innovation later in this calendar year. So the way to think about it is that our innovation timing this year is different from the innovation timing last year and what that will lead to, and clearly has in Q3, is unevenness quarter-by-quarter versus year-ago. But in the long run, we feel good about this business. It's on trend. The brand is doing well. And as you know, we, in part, also like this business because it's a nice margin trade-up for the company","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. I just had a kind of housekeeping type question. On Charcoal, so you specifically mentioned that not just the weather but also that there was a negative mix dynamic within Charcoal this quarter, because of the lower growth of the higher-margin items in the portfolio. Is that because you weren't supporting it as much ahead of the Kingsford, the new launch that's really getting the full support in the fourth quarter?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yes, perhaps. Thanks, Lauren. Just quickly on Charcoal, sales down in Q3, right, after double-digit growth in Q2 and also in the year-ago quarter. Slower start to the grilling season, weather-related and we're certainly watching the weather also in Q4. But the comment that we made on Match Light and the higher-end product is related to merchandising. So I don't know that I would read anything strategic into that. But as there was less merchandising, as the weather was weaker in Q3, that particular part of the business was certainly affected.","We've also noted that we are launching, and that was towards the end of Q3, premium priced and margin-accretive innovation with the new Charcoal that we call long-burning that burns 25% longer. And that's off to a nice start, and we're feeling good about that. So that should contribute to hopefully better results in Q4. Again, this is the main quarter for Charcoal, and it's not over until it's over, depending on the weather. But we certainly feel good about the partnership that we have with retailers on the marketing and merchandising side on this business.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then just lastly, it's interesting this is probably the one call that I've been on so far this earnings season where there wasn't a discussion of the consumer environment and where did he or she go in the first quarter of the calendar year and so on. So if you could comment on what you're seeing in terms of consumer behavior, consumer demand, because it sounds like your concern at this point is more about retailer-driven \u2013 competition in the retailers, and, thus, deflation in the categories driven by retailer competition, and maybe of what that trains the consumer to do, or pantry loading, and future impact, but less about the consumer themselves. So anything you can offer would be wonderful.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yes. That's spot on and well summarized, Lauren. Again, the best way to look at it is if you look at category volumes and you compare them versus a year ago, they're up. But they're not up more versus a year ago, which suggests that I don't see any reason to believe that there's pantry loading going on, but categories are up modestly, and they were about a year ago.","So, fundamentally, the consumer hasn't stopped shopping our categories. They continue to shop our categories, but they're paying slightly less for it, and that's driven by consumer migration towards value channels, clearly, where we're doing particularly well, as it's well documented, but it's also driven by retailers and the competition and perhaps the anticipation of the discounter expansion.","So that's something that we have prepared ourselves for a while, and that's why we've continued to talk about our focus on value as the core of our strategy through innovation, through brand building, through investments, through pricing, through dollar SKUs, all those things that are well documented. Those we believe are continuing to be the right ones. So that we don't see a consumer malaise, but what we need to make sure is that our consumer volume will continue to lead to consumer-dollar growth in our categories, and that's what our discussions with retailers are focused on.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's great. Thank you so much.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Thanks, Lauren.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Dorer, I'd now like to turn the conference back to you.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yes. Thank you, and in closing, I am pleased with our continued top-line momentum and strong earnings growth this quarter, and we're certainly on track to deliver solid sales and earnings growth for the fiscal year. Our Strategy 2020 continues to work, and we believe it remains the right one for Clorox to create value for shareholders over the long run.","We look forward to speaking with all of you, again, in August when we share our fourth quarter and year-end results and our outlook for fiscal year 2018. So thank you, and have a good day, everyone.","Operator","And, again, that does conclude our call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time."],"5207":["The Clorox Co.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Mr. Steve Austenfeld, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Mr. Austenfeld, you may begin the conference.","Steven Austenfeld - Vice President-Investor Relations","Great. Thank you. And thank you for joining Clorox's third quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, Clorox's CEO; and Steve Robb, our Chief Financial Officer.","We're broadcasting this call over the Internet and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com. Let me remind you that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures including but not limited to free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt-to-EBITDA, and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release, this webcast, prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the financial results area of our website as well as in our filings with the SEC. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earning release.","Please recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.","Now turning to our prepared remarks, I'll cover highlights of our third quarter performance by segment. I'll then turn it over to Steve Robb, who will address our financial results and our outlook look for fiscal year 2016. Benno will then share his perspective on our strategy, results and the acquisition of Renew Life, which we announced earlier today. And then after that, we'll take your questions.","So starting with our top-line results, the investments we're making in our brands to drive profitable, consistent growth are clearly working. In the third quarter, volume grew 4%, reflecting gains in each of our business segments. Sales increased 2%, and that was on top of the 3% growth in the year ago quarter. Excluding foreign currency devaluation, so in other words, on a currency-neutral basis, total company sales were up 5%, primarily due to strong volume growth and price increases.","These factors were partially offset by continuing unfavorable foreign exchange rates, which impacted Clorox in Latin America, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. In particular, following the currency devaluation in December in Argentina, the country that represents one of our larger exposures outside of the United States, the Argentine peso is down roughly 40%, resulting in a material foreign exchange headwind through calendar year 2016, and with risk of further devaluation in the future.","Looking just at the U.S., sales grew 4% reflecting growth in all three U.S. segments. From a market share standpoint, our U.S. 13-week share increased 0.2 of a point versus the year ago quarter, ending the quarter at 23%. Our investments in higher margin, faster-growing businesses are continuing to drive improvement as this was the fifth consecutive quarterly increase in market share. Four of our eight U.S. retail business units increased market share with all-time record shares in Home Care and strong gains in Charcoal. Our primary opportunities for further improving market share remain in Cat Litter and Water Filtration, and I'm pleased that we have innovation in both supported by significant marketing support.","In addition to improving market shares, driving category growth remains a top priority. And during the quarter, our U.S. categories were up a very healthy 2.5 points, representing our fifth consecutive quarter of U.S. category growth of greater than two points. For perspective, during the recession several years ago, our categories were only growing between 0% and 1%.","Turning to International, our market shares were up 0.4 of a point for the eight-month period ending in January. International share growth was particularly strong in Bleach. In recognizing the uncertainty today in many international markets, it is great to see that our choiceful investments and profitable opportunities in select international markets are paying off in higher market shares.","So with that, I'll review our third quarter results by segment. Starting with our Cleaning segment, third quarter volume in sales each increased a strong 5%, largely due to higher shipments of Home Care products as well as our Professional Products business.","In Home Care, which was our largest U.S. business unit, sales increased strongly with growth seen across most Clorox-branded products. In particular, the relatively mild cold and flu season \u2013 despite the relatively mild cold and flu season, we delivered strong double-digit growth on Clorox Disinfecting Wipes as well as all-time record shipments of Clorox Clean-Up bleach-based spray cleaner. And additionally, our Clorox Disinfecting Wipes with Micro Scrubbers innovation continues to grow share, and while it's still early, we are pleased with the initial performance of several recently launched ScrubSingles items.","These are all great examples that show investments in our cleaning in-the-flow growth platform, which emphasizes quick and convenient cleaning are paying off. In addition, effective in late March, we regained Disinfecting Wipes distribution at Costco, a major club customer and a long time retail partner of Clorox. Although consumption in the club channel is not fully reflected in traditional external market share reports, this distribution at Costco will be in addition to the greater than 50% market share we have in track channels today within the Disinfecting Wipes segment.","This additional distribution will add meaningfully to volume over the next year, but also modestly impact margins recognizing the club consumers typically buying a larger size item with a lower margin profile for manufacturers like Clorox. That said, consumers in the club channel tend to be very loyal to the brands they buy. So we're very excited to be able to meet the needs of club channel consumers for disinfecting and cleaning solutions through this expanded distribution.","Turning to Laundry, sales decreased slightly in the quarter due to its continued softness in the color-safe bleach category and lower shipments of regular Clorox bleach related to our price increase taken in February of 2015. Importantly, however, our focus on Clorox Splash-Less Bleach continues to drive sales and share growth on this higher margin business. And finally, within the Cleaning segment, our Professional Products business delivered strong double-digit sales growth. We feel very good about the strength of this business and continue to believe this will be one of the faster-growing businesses in our portfolio going forward.","Turning to the Household segment, we delivered 3% volume and 4% sales growth, driven by strong gains in our Charcoal business. Charcoal strength was aided by very favorable weather ahead of the main grilling season, as well as favorable product and channel mix, as well as distribution of new items, including an Easy Wipe bag, new Charcoal items with hickory and Applewood and a new competition briquette. Early season merchandising got off to a strong start at key retailers as evidenced by higher consumption and meaningful share growth. And while we may see a slowdown in the fourth quarter given the very strong results in Q3, our Charcoal business is fundamentally sound and on track to have a strong fiscal year, as evidenced by 7% volume growth fiscal year-to-date behind strong fundamental execution with customers and compelling demand-building campaigns.","Turning to Bags & Wraps, sales were flat although this masks the success we continue to have in driving our strategy to accelerate profitable growth, mainly driving category trade-up from base trash bags to higher margin ForceFlex and OdorShield offerings. As evidence, our premium trash bag segment was up high single digits in the third quarter supported in part by our new Glad with Clorox kitchen trash bags featuring the antimicrobial properties that help control the growth of bacterial odors as well as the recent launch of two new scents of Glad OdorShield bags with the Power of Febreze.","It's also worth noting that our food storage segment made up of food storage bags, wraps and containers had its second consecutive quarter of solid volume growth and is up 3% in shipments fiscal year-to-date. So, all said, we expect the Glad business to have a strong finish to fiscal year 2016.","And in Cat Litter, third quarter sales decreased, primarily due to the timing of promotional spending behind the launch of Fresh Step with Febreze. While it's still very early, we are pleased with the initial response to this launch and plan to continue investing in demand-building activities to drive profitable growth in this highly competitive category.","Looking at our Lifestyle segment, volume grew 4% and sales grew 5%, reflecting sales growth in all three businesses, Natural Personal Care, Water Filtration, and Food. Starting with our Burt's Bees business, it delivered another quarter of double-digit volume growth behind continued strength in facial towelettes, momentum behind recent innovations including new lipsticks, blemish balm cream, also known as BB cream, as well as refresh on our tinted lip balms. Burt's Bees Q3 market shares were up in every major segment, reflecting the broad-based health of the business.","Turning to our Brita Water Filtration business, sales grew strongly, driven by double-digit volume growth, particularly in untracked channels such as e-commerce. We're continuing to focus on driving trial and distribution behind new pitchers and better filter value. Our demand creation strategy centering on a partnership between Brita and Stephen Curry, the National Basketball Association's Most Valuable Player, kicked off in March with national television ads as well as through digital, PR and social media campaigns. And while it's still early, we feel very good about this partnership.","In our Food business, while volume decreased slightly we did see our third consecutive quarter of sales growth, supported by the expansion of our Ranch With bottled salad dressings. In addition, our focus on innovation in our base Ranch flavor drove meaningful share growth on Hidden Valley dressings and dips. Volume on our dry business was up in Q3, driven by the February launch of Greek Yogurt dressing and dips.","And lastly, our acquisition several years ago of the Soy Vay Asian sauces and marinade continues to pay off, as we saw significantly higher volume in Q3 with even higher expectations for Q4. So overall we feel very good about the direction of our Food business.","Turning to our last operating segment, International sales dropped 9% due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates, with all major markets being impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar and particular impact being seen in Argentina, one of Clorox's bigger International markets. As noted a moment ago, following the Argentina currency devaluation in December, the Argentine peso is down roughly 40% and remains at risk of further devaluation going forward.","Putting that aside, on a currency neutral basis, sales for International grew 9%. Although foreign currency headwinds remain a challenge for us and for other multinationals, we are pleased that our Go Lean strategy focused on driving margin improvement in International is working and has enabled us to keep margins stable as we focus on driving value in four areas, specifically, pricing, cost savings, right-sizing our infrastructure and optimizing demand creation.","We have also segmented our International portfolio into fuel and growth businesses as we've done in the U.S. and are investing selectively in high-growth opportunity areas. For example, we are stepping up investment in Burt's Bees in markets like Canada, Australia, the UK, Chile and Mexico. And we're also investing in Laundry initiatives in Latin America and the Middle East. For example, our Clorox clothes color-safe laundry additive innovation is off to a strong start in several international markets. Looking forward, we remain committed to our International business and look forward to improving International margins over time.","So to wrap up, we're very pleased with our top-line performance in Q3 and fiscal year to-date, which reflects the significant investment we've made in our brands. Looking ahead, in addition to incremental trade promotion spending in the second half of fiscal year 2016 to support new products, we also anticipate increasing our advertising investment to about 12% of sales in the fourth quarter to keep our brands healthy and growing.","You can look at this investment in two main buckets. The first bucket is supporting innovation, including the product launches we referenced today, namely new offerings of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, Premium Glad trash bags as we build on the OdorShield line, Fresh Step Cat Litter with Febreze, several Kingsford Charcoal items, new flavors of Ranch With bottled salad dressings and a number of recent Burt's Bees launches both in the U.S. and in international markets. So that support is all innovation-focused.","The second bucket of greater investment is protecting our brands from competitive pressures in key categories. For example, we're investing savings from decreased resin cost to defend Glad at the shelf. In Home Care, we're increasing promotions in-store to defend against competitive activity. And we plan to continue investing in demand-building activities behind Fresh Step with Febreze to drive profitable growth in the highly competitive Cat Litter category. Looking ahead, as noted in this morning's press release, we've raised our sales growth outlook for fiscal year 2016 reflecting our strong results to-date as well as a solid finish anticipated in Q4.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Steve Robb to discuss our Q3 financial performance as well as our updated outlook for fiscal year 2016.","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, thanks, Steve. And welcome, everyone. Well, we're certainly pleased with our strong results to-date, including our third quarter performance, which enabled us to raise our fiscal year 2016 outlook. Our updated outlook also includes the announced acquisition of the Renew Life business. I'll address the details behind our full-year outlook in just a minute.","First I'll turn to our financial results for the quarter. In our third quarter, sales grew 2%, with volume and pricing contributing a combined impact of nearly 6 points, partially offset by more than 3 points of unfavorable foreign currency and a little more than 0.5 point of higher trade promotion investment. Gross margin for the quarter increased 210 basis points to 45.3%, reflecting 180 basis points from favorable commodities, primarily from resin and diesel, 120 basis points of cost savings and 100 basis points of pricing benefit.","These factors were partially offset by about 150 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs primarily driven by higher inflation in international markets. Selling and administrative expense decreased to 14.3% of sales compared with 14.7% of sales in the year-ago quarter. Selling and administrative expenses were also slightly lower on an absolute dollar basis.","Our advertising and sales promotion investment for the quarter was up $22 million, with total spend more than 10% of sales, and it reflects continued strong support for our U.S. business and incremental investments in select higher margin international businesses, including Burt's Bees.","Net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.21, a 12% increase versus the year-ago quarter, reflecting strong gross margin expansion and higher sales. Our fiscal year-to-date free cash flow was $323 million compared with $398 million in the year ago period, reflecting higher employee incentive compensation payments made this fiscal year related to the company's strong fiscal year 2015 performance as well as higher tax payments.","These factors were partially offset by higher earnings from continuing operations. We now anticipate our full-year free cash flow to be in the range of 10% to 11% of sales. We ended the quarter with a debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.8, below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5. However, with the recently announced acquisition of Renew Life, we anticipate being at the lower end of our target range by the end of the fiscal year.","Now we'll turn to our updated fiscal year 2016 outlook. As Steve mentioned, we raised our fiscal year sales outlook to 1% to 2% growth based on our sales results to date, and we feel good about landing in the mid to upper end of our range. We continue to anticipate fiscal year 2016 sales to benefit from 3 points of product innovation, moderated by continued slowing international economies and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.","On a currency neutral basis, we now anticipate sales growth of 4% to 5%. We now anticipate EBIT margin expansion of about 50 basis points compared to our previous outlook of 50 basis points to 75 basis points. The lower estimate for EBIT margin reflects nearly 25 basis points of impact from the onetime transaction costs and other related acquisition expenses including the effective inventory step-up charges and intangible asset amortization.","All other assumptions for EBIT margin remain generally the same, including greater gross margin expansion behind lower commodity costs, partially offset by continued global inflation impacting both manufacturing and logistics costs. Other factors pressuring EBIT margin continue to include inflation in international markets and weaker foreign currencies, as well as consumer demand building programs to support the long-term health of our brands. We continue to anticipate selling and administrative expenses to be about 14% of sales in fiscal year 2016, and we continue to anticipate our fiscal year 2016 tax rate on earnings from continuing operations to be between 34% and 35%.","For added context, I'd like to address what we will anticipate for the fourth quarter. First, as we discussed in our last earnings call, we began stepping up our level of advertising investment in the third quarter. We expect this to continue through the fourth quarter and we anticipate advertising spending to be about 12% of sales to support recent innovation including our Burt's Bees lip color products and Fresh Step with Febreze Cat Litter. For the full fiscal year, advertising spending is expected to be about 10% of sales, an increase of about one point of sales versus year ago. Now, while this will reduce margins and earnings in the near term, we believe these are the right strategic investments to drive the long-term growth of our core business.","With respect to the acquisition, we anticipate about a point of sales benefit from Renew Life in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we don't expect the business to contribute meaningfully to company sales until fiscal year 2017, given the acquisition was closed late in fiscal 2016. Net of all of these factors, we raised our fiscal year 2016 outlook for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.85 to $4.95, which includes dilution of about $0.03 to $0.05 from the acquisition. This compares with our previous EPS outlook of $4.75 to $4.90.","I'd also like to provide additional perspective on the Renew Life acquisition, a business rooted in the fast-growing digestive health category and complementary to our global portfolio. This U.S. centric bolt-on acquisition is consistent with our strategy to acquire leading brands in fast-growing mid-sized health and wellness categories.","Over the last several years, Renew Life has enjoyed high single-digit sales increases and gross margins that are generally in line with our company averages. Importantly, we believe the business was acquired for a good price, $290 million or about 2.5 times sales. And while this business is anticipated to be dilutive to earnings per share over the next year or so as we invest heavily in demand creation programs and integrate the business into Clorox, we anticipate the business to be EPS neutral to accretive in fiscal year 2018.","As we look ahead to fiscal year 2017, we'll be keenly focused on the following things. First, we continue to face a tough business environment in international markets. We anticipate ongoing foreign currency headwinds will negatively impact fiscal year 2017 sales by about two points. Second, we plan to continue investing heavily in advertising, consistent with our full-year 2016 spending levels to drive awareness and trial of our new products. Our increased investments will help sustain the momentum of our core business in the face of ongoing competitive activity and consumers who remain cautious in their spending.","Third, integrating Renew Life into Clorox is a priority, and we'll place strong emphasis on investing in demand creation and expanding distribution to drive the growth of the business and its categories. In fiscal year 2017, we anticipate Renew Life will contribute nearly two percentage points to company sales and expect our investments to integrate and fuel the growth of the business will reduce earnings per share by about $0.05 to $0.07.","In closing, we're very pleased with our third quarter performance and the ability to continue investing strongly in our core business while acquiring a leading brand in Renew Life. We remain committed to our long-term strategy of driving profitable growth, including making strategic investments to fuel our innovation programs and our cost savings pipeline.","Now, I'll turn it over to Benno.","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Steve, and hello to everyone on the call. I'd like for you to take three things away from today's call and press releases. First, our 2020 Strategy continues to deliver strong shareholder returns. Second, consistent with the 2020 Strategy, we've been making significant investments in our brand behind the strategy accelerators, and these investments are working. Third, we remain focused on accelerating consistent, profitable growth by positioning our portfolio behind tailwinds as reflected in the acquisition of Renew Life into our family of brands. I'd like to share a little perspective on each of these three areas.","The first takeaway, our Strategy 2020 continues to deliver strong shareholder returns. This is certainly evident in our strong Q3 top-line growth, reflected by growing market shares and household penetration on key brands in the U.S. On a currency neutral basis, we're seeing growth in international as well. We have strong gross margin expansion, supporting incremental investments in our brands. And we delivered strong earnings per share growth. These results, the health of our businesses, and our overall strong fundamental execution have enabled us to raise our fiscal year sales and earnings outlook.","The second take-away \u2013 consistent with a 2020 Strategy, we've been making significant investments in our brands behind the strategy accelerators, and these investments are working. As discussed earlier in the call, in addition to incremental trade promotion spending in the second half of the fiscal year to support new products, we anticipate increasing our advertising investment to about 12% of sales in the fourth quarter to keep our brands healthy and growing.","Now, you might ask yourself why the increased investment and why now? Well, we have strong momentum on our brands as evidenced by our recent result, and seek to continue that momentum by investing behind our strategic priorities, in particular, the strong innovation currently in market. But we're also continuing to support the health of the base business by investing in awareness and trial, and we do like the long-term returns on these investments based on extensive analytics we do across all of our brand investment. So in a nutshell, we're taking the long-term view to invest in driving sustained profitable growth in an environment where such growth is hard to come by.","And the third takeaway \u2013 we remain focused on accelerating consistent, profitable growth by positioning our portfolio behind tailwinds such as digestive health as reflected by the acquisition of Renew Life into our family of brands. We are very excited about the opportunity Renew Life brings to the Clorox portfolio as a leader in health and wellness with an emphasis on digestive health. Through this acquisition, we are expanding into a fast-growing market that aligns with our strategy to accelerate growth through bolt-on acquisitions of brands in mid-size categories that are number one, or strong number two in market share, economically attractive, and leverage our core competency.","Renew Life is the number one brand of probiotics in the natural channel with a steadily growing share in the food, drug and mass channel. And probiotics products represent about two-thirds of Renew Life sales. Digestive health is a growing consumer need and still a highly fragmented category, which provides for an attractive competitive set. The digestive health market in the U.S. represents annual sales of more than $10 billion and is growing at about 7% annually. The probiotics subcategory is about $1.3 billion annually in the U.S. and is expected to grow at 15% per year. This acquisition enables us to expand our health and wellness platform even further. We believe that we have an opportunity to make a difference to the business through our strong 3D brand building capabilities.","We also believe that Renew Life has scalability and distribution expansion potential in existing and new channels. So we look forward to building on the strong foundation the Renew Life team has built and bringing the benefits of digestive health products to more consumers while maintaining a keen focus on the health of our core business.","And with that, let's open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Dorer. And our first question comes from Steve Powers with UBS.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Hey, guys. So some of this you touched upon in the latter part of your prepared remarks, but just that step-up to 12% in ad spending in Q4, was that always the plan? Or you decided to do that based on the year-to-date strength? And if it's the latter, just talk about how your \u2013 what your assurances are that you'll get a good ROI on that investment. And do you wish at all that you'd spent more earlier to kind of even out those investments in the marketplace?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Steve, this is Steve Robb. Short answer is, yes, this has always been a part of the plan. You might recall in the third quarter earnings call we talked about significantly stepping up our consumer demand building investment programs, particularly advertising. You saw that in the third quarter where we invested incrementally about $22 million in advertising and we're going to step it up again.","Part of the timing this year for the advertising investments, it's a reflection of the new product program. If you're going to step up your level of advertising, you want to have something to talk about and Fresh Step with Febreze, the Burt's Bees lip color launch, these are the things that we're really leaning in heavy to. So the spending increase is back-loaded this year, but it's back-loaded consistent with the programs.","And then finally, from a return on investment, we do a lot of extensive measuring and tracking and scorecarding of all of the investments we make and to-date we've seen very good returns. We're going to continue to lean in and, as always, we'll adjust as appropriate as we get new information. But at this point, we feel like it's a very good ROI. But keep in mind, the investments we make in the fourth quarter, most of the benefit will I think be in future years as you get awareness and trial on those new products.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. And I know some of it is going to be targeted at the Cat Litter business. And a little bit more perspective there because the consumer takeaway data still looks soft, at least in the tracked channels. I think it was down 5% in April, your business was, and down just over 1 point in the last 12 weeks despite the marketing and the R&D efforts to-date. So I know you said you were pleased. Just any update there? And what's realistic to expect from that business as we progress forward into your fourth quarter and beyond?","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Steve, we remain pleased with this. We've always said that it's going to take time for us to turn the share around. It's actually great to see that if you look at the last four weeks to five weeks in the quarter, share had stopped eroding and it started to be flat. So we feel good about that and we're investing behind it. The customer takeaway is strong, early consumer acceptance is strong.","And we're investing behind this, certainly knowing that competition aren't pushovers in this category. But we know from consumer data that we have a better product on hand and we're investing in awareness and trial and we continue to be optimistic that this innovation is going to make a difference to the business.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Great. And then just one last one, if I could, which is around the Renew Life acquisition. Should we think about that as accretive to fiscal 2018 versus the current base case? Or is that too ambitious, given the investment plans that you talked through?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think what I had said in my opening remarks is it's early days and so we need to get farther into it. We've owned this business for about a day now. But based on our internal projections, we anticipate it will be neutral to accretive in fiscal 2018. And, again, part of the reason that you're not seeing more accretion earlier, this is a business that's been growing high-single digits, again, it's got attractive margins.","Just like we did with Burt's Bees many years ago, we want to fuel that growth, so we are going to be stepping up the level of consumer demand building investments over the next couple years, particularly as we expand the distribution across the U.S. So that's the number one reason I think as you get into fiscal 2018 we're being a bit cautious on the EPS accretion. But certainly it's a profitable business with good cash flows and we feel very good about it.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll now take a question from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys. Hey, what happened with gross margin relative to your guidance? Because I think you were saying like 100 basis points for the full year and then it was up like a couple hundred basis points for the first half. It seemed like you were thinking gross margin was going to be flat, and then it came up like another 200 basis points this quarter.","So were you guys just being conservative? Or did something sort of change for the better in the quarter? And then maybe just what do you think the gross margin is going to be up for the full year now?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Bill, I couldn't hear the second part of the question. Let me try the first part and then if you have a follow-up question, we're happy to answer it. Gross margin certainly came in better than we had anticipated in the third quarter. Two drivers I would call out. The first is just stronger top-line growth for the company. As you know, you get a bit of scale advantage when you have stronger growth. And we also had some positive mix. We had real strength in some of our businesses, like Brita, which is higher margin, our Burt's Bees business which is higher margin.","So that certainly helped. I would also say commodity costs came in a bit better than we had expected. Now, I'm going to caution on that as well, because I do think commodity costs are starting to reach a bottom at this point. I think we found the floor. And we're watching it pretty carefully because I think as you go into the fourth quarter and as we look at our gross margin, we think gross margins are likely to be flattish in the fourth quarter. And the reason for that is we're starting to lap some of the commodity goodness we saw in the year-ago period and we're also investing more in consumer demand spend that we talked about earlier.","So I feel great about the margin expansion for the company, feel good about delivering about 50 bps of EBIT margin expansion for the year, but I do think, looking forward, gross margin growth is going to start to slow down as the commodity tailwinds dissipate.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. And then just on this Renew Life acquisition, are you funding it with cash on hand or are you going to (37:29)?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, that's a good question. Short term, you'll see us use a mix of cash and commercial paper. I think longer term, we'll have to take a look at our capital structure and upcoming debt maturities and then we'll make a determination on the best way to fund it. I think it's safe to say over the very long term, at some point we'll probably go out with additional debt, but that's a decision we'll take in the future based on the facts and circumstances that we have.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Because the reason I ask is that assuming it will cost you maybe a couple percent at most in terms of (38:00). It seems like based on your dilution guidance that the thing is going to lose quite a bit of money, like $8 million to $10 million next year. Is that directionally what you guys are thinking?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Bill, the $0.05 to $0.07 of EPS dilution for fiscal 2017, it's really being driven by the cost to integrate the business, which is important to us because, remember, if we can integrate this quickly, we can get revenue synergies. We can get it on the same trucks. We can assist in accelerating the top-line growth for the business. So we certainly have money to integrate the business. We also have money for the step-up in inventory, which, as you know, you have to do intangible assets amortization, et cetera. So those are the primary drivers.","But in addition to that, we'll also spend more on consumer demand building investment. To be clear, it's a business in fiscal 2017 that we're expecting good growth rates, healthy margins. But what we found is it's important to integrate quickly and to lean in and build on the momentum that the great people at Renew Life have been delivering over the last couple of years.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got you. And then will this be a platform for you guys? So is this like a broader entry into the CMS space? Or is this kind of an opportunistic (39:12)?","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Bill, we certainly look at this as strategic and I think it's very consistent with what we've said over the last two years, three years since we've begun the journey on the 2020 Strategy. What we said is that Health & Wellness, as defined as in me, on me and around me is a space that we're very interested in, and this certainly is bull's eye. We believe that certainly this acquisition will be attractive for our shareholders as a standalone, but we'll certainly also continue to look at this as a potentially broader platform just like we've done with Burt's Bees.","I look at Burt's Bees as a very solid role model for this where the first tranche of value creation came from distribution expansion followed by strong investments in the base business to continue to drive what clearly here is a fast-growing category based on a growing consumer need. About two-thirds of U.S. consumers have experienced digestive health issues, and that trend is expected to continue behind the dietary habits that we're seeing from consumers. So investing in awareness and trial and on the base product certainly is the second opportunity here.","And then the third opportunity is to look at adjacent spaces around whether that's organically or perhaps through additional business development activity, and perhaps that it will yield an opportunity to add additional growth down the road. But for the time being, we're focused on driving awareness and trial and distribution on the base product by applying our strong 3D capabilities which I think are a wonderful fit to add to the great work that the current team has already done on the business.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Operator","We'll now take a question from Joe Altobello with Raymond James.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Morning, guys. First question on the wipes business at Costco. Was there any impact from this quarter? It sounds like it happened in March, wasn't sure if there was a pipeline fill for that.","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","No, Joe. This started shipping again at the very end of Q3, so no impact.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then going forward, what's the volume impact you think that will have?","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","Well, I don't know that we disclosed the specific volume impact. But obviously Costco is a significant customer of ours and certainly what these Costco customers as well as club customers in general are is pretty loyal to the channel. So the volume incrementality certainly is expected to be pretty significant to the wipes business, which will continue to help us increase household penetration on disinfecting wipes.","As you know, disinfecting wipes is a business that has been growing share very strongly for us over the last two years frankly. The category also is up 6% over the past 52 weeks, and we're clearly leaning into a tailwind on wipes, and now we're happy to have this business back.","What I will say in addition to your question, Joe, is importantly we stayed principled as we regained this distribution. What we've commented on two years ago was that it is always our aim to stay fair and equitable to all trade customers and ensure that all customers qualify for the same conditions, and it's important to close the loop on this and emphasize that that statement has remained true as we've been able to regain the distribution at Costco at this point.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. That's helpful. And then switching gears to Burt's Bees, it looks like another double-digit quarter. How much further is there for that brand to extend into other categories? And where do you think the brand has a right to enter from a product perspective going forward?","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","Well, without getting into specifics, Joe, which I know you'll understand that we can't. We certainly believe that this brand has a lot of potential in three ways. And all of that is consistent with what we said in the past. First of all, just continue to drive awareness and trial on the base business: lip, face, body, we have a lot of products out there that enjoy a very strong consumer loyalty but have an opportunity in increasing awareness and trials, so more consumers can use these products, and that is job number one. And we're driving that through tactics like TV advertising which we, for the first time, did last year and which we'll do again this year and believe we'll deliver solid additional growth just on the base.","The second opportunity certainly is an expansion into new categories and we're very pleased with how lipsticks is going. It's now the number five lipstick in a very cluttered market, and it's overtaken some very established and prominent brands. Most recently lipsticks did receive a very prestigious award by Cosmopolitan magazine, who called it their favorite lipstick ever, which certainly is something that we were very pleased to see.","And then third, the opportunity continues to be in international, and Steve Austenfeld has talked about that earlier in this call where we believe that both in markets that we're already in as well as in markets that we have a very small presence, there's a lot of opportunity to repeat the success that we've had in the U.S. And we're investigating in that. So category expansion will continue to be name of the game, but it's really part of a three-pronged growth strategy that also includes growth on the base and growth in new countries.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Understood. Okay. Thanks, Benno.","Operator","And we'll now take a question from John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. Wanted to chat a little bit about Cat Litter, this is obviously a category where you probably had the greatest competitive headwinds over the past couple of years and probably the toughest for you guys to crack from that standpoint. So I guess as you look at it, how comfortable are you now that this is \u2013 you sort of figured out the two or three pieces that you need to push on in order to get the shares moving in the right direction longer-term, given the fact, again, that you've had so much tough competition over the past couple of years?","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, certainly a business that we want to perform better, and as we said earlier, John, we're encouraged by what we're seeing, but we're not done yet. So this will take more time. What we've said is that it requires an increase in investment and we're certainly putting that in place.","What we've also said is that will require innovation, and with Fresh Step with Febreze, we're off to a good start. But what we've also said is that it will require sustained innovation over time, and we're certainly working on that and we have respective plans in place to follow up with more innovation later in the year \u2013 later in this calendar year and then next calendar year as well. So this is a journey. We're off to a good start. We have more work to do, but we're certainly encouraged by what we're seeing.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And then if I can just ask a follow-up for Steve on the FX guidance. I mean we're not seeing the type of guidance for the type of currency impact that you're talking about for next year. So, are you using forecasts as opposed to spot rates? Or are you potentially looking at another deval that you've built into your numbers from that standpoint? Thanks.","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, we use a bank consensus rate, so basically they're forward-looking rates. And it's hard to call the FX markets, as you know. But if you just look at the devaluation that Steve Austenfeld talked briefly about in Argentina and look at the carryover effect of that and then just put on the softening currencies, particularly in Latin America, preliminary estimates would seem to indicate about a two-point drag on sales next year. Probably a little bit stronger in the first part of the year than the second half the year, but we'll have to see. But what's important to note, I think for each country, it's different. So our market participation is probably different than many other companies and that may be driving some differences.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll now go to Olivia Tong with Bank of America.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. On the wipes business, a lot of the one-off concerns that drove wipes are well in the past, the virus concerns and things like that. And this was a fairly benign cold and flu season. So I was surprised to see wipes and cleaners up double digits. So can you talk through what drove that? Do you think this is a sustainable level going forward? And how do you feel about inventory levels at retail, particularly given a fairly temperate start to the year in terms of weather, which obviously helped Charcoal? And then obviously, now the greater availability now that you're back in Costco.","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Olivia, first of all, congratulations again on the birth of your son.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Appreciate it.","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","You're right in saying that the cold and flu season has been relatively benign, but we feel like the wipes business has reached a threshold where cold and flu certainly helps, but where the business is no longer dependent upon cold and flu. So the success is really based on several things. First of all, just basic consumer trends. We've talked to all of you before about the fact that this is a very preferred product form as consumers increasingly clean in the flow versus on their hands and knees.","So we're just having a lot of consumer tailwinds. Second, we're fueling those tailwinds with innovation, mostly innovation that increases the versatility of use and allows consumers to use wipes in new places, whether that's on glass, whether that's on wood, whether that's in bathroom or, more recently, for the tougher jobs in the kitchen. Clorox disinfecting wipes with Micro Scrubbers has been incredibly successful and is growing market share and we're fueling that success with additional investments.","And then certainly the distribution expansion like the one that was talked about will help. So we have high hopes that we'll continue to see strong growth on wipes in the future. Certainly near-term, we'll see very significant growth as we continue to benefit from the Costco distribution expansion, but we think that based on the investment in those few pillars that I mentioned, we'll continue to see sustained growth on disinfecting wipes down the road.","Operator","We'll now take a question from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Just a couple of questions. One is, as you think about gross and operating margins going forward, what should we think about as we start to lap commodity benefits? Steve, you mentioned flat coming up here, but thinking more about fiscal 2017, because you are lapping commodity benefits. I don't see new pricing on your sheet here necessarily that that's meaningful, A&P up, et cetera. It feels like you're kind of signaling a deceleration of EPS growth for 2017 and I want to get at that through the margin lens first, please.","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So let me address the margins. So, first of all, we'll provide the outlook, Ali, in August that we typically do every year. What I do think is important is a trend to call out is commodity prices, which are notoriously difficult to forecast. But again, as I said earlier, energy prices have really started to come up pretty sharply. It looks like the commodity market has stabilized.","What does that mean? It means as we go into fiscal 2017, particularly as we move through fiscal 2017, I think some of the benefits we've been enjoying from lower commodity costs are going to start to dissipate. What we can do as a company is focus on the things we can control, keeping the cost savings pipeline healthy, and we're doing that. We're focusing on rebuilding our margins in international with our Go Lean efforts. That's something we're also going to continue. And we're also focused on taking pricing and high inflationary economies.","So, I think the actions that we're taking should, over the very long-term, help us deliver EBIT margin expansion in the range of 25 bps to 50 bps, but you will see variability across the quarters and even across the years at times, but I do feel good about the programs we have in place to not just keep the margins healthy, but to build them over the very long-term.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And then if I take that from a top-line perspective as well, I think Steve Austenfeld mentioned this quarter about 20 basis points up on market share. And that's meaningful, that's good. But it does suggest very much to your point as well that your category is accelerating. As you go forth, that's a lot of volume.","But what I'm trying to figure out from a category perspective because you're growing clearly ahead of the category but not massively ahead, the category is accelerating. What dynamics do you see there going on in the category? And as you go forward, do you think you'll be able to take more pricing to offset the commodities and so to keep that category momentum going at this pace?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Ali, let me start with the second question, which is pricing. Again, what we've said is we'll price to recover inflation and to protect our margins over the long term, so we would prefer not to take pricing, given the consumer remains at a fragile condition. Nonetheless, at this point, we'll take pricing where we need it over the long term. The key for us ultimately is going to be innovation and driving innovation growth.","So here's how we think of it over the next couple of years and maybe into fiscal 2017. We continue to aspire to deliver 3% to 5% top-line sales growth. Now, embedded in that is an assumption that our U.S. business grows at 2% to 4%. I will say, based on what we're seeing, not just with the categories, but importantly our innovation programs and the investments that we're making, we feel very good about delivering solid growth in this range of 2% to 4% based on what we know today.","I think the bigger challenge that we have, like many other companies, is on the International side where the slowing economies, the FX headwinds, the challenging environment. I think that's likely to weigh on top-line sales growth for International in fiscal 2017, which is why our efforts to focus on innovation going lean are the right efforts. So on balance, I feel like we're doing a pretty good job as a company. We've got solid plans that we're building now for fiscal 2017 and we'll provide additional color on the August call.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And my last question is just going back to Renew Life. I think you guys have, in Benno's piece, made a good case, a compelling case, for why this is a strong business in and of itself. But I still don't understand why it's a great business for Clorox, why it's a great business for you. It's clearly a different category, a different competitive set, different expertise. So I'm trying to always ask this question of, is it buying growth or is there something you can add to it that's incremental to what they could do themselves or with some other partner? Thank you.","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Ali, we certainly believe that we can add to this. So first of all, if I look at just the basic category, fundamentally we're a health and wellness company. So our company was founded 103 years ago today. And it was founded based on disinfecting product and bleach. And over time, whether that's through our Professional Products, through Brita, through Green Works, through Burt's Bees, we have continued to go deeper into health and wellness. And this is just another example. So for us, we look at this as a health and wellness business where our capabilities can make a real difference.","First of all, this is the number one brand in the Natural channel, but there's a very significant potential to grow through distribution in food, drug, mass, certainly here in the U.S., but also in Canada and then in international over time. And that's really bull's eye as it relates to applying Clorox world-class capabilities. I would hold up our capabilities when it comes to driving distribution against any company in our space. And we've certainly proven that time and time again.","We've also proven that in the health and wellness space through brand building and through innovation we can make great differences to businesses that we acquire over time, whether that's Burt's Bees or, if you reach further back, Hidden Valley or Brita, we pretty much followed the same model. They were pretty small when we bought them, they were new categories for us when we bought them. But we've made an incredible difference and turned them into brand powerhouses.","And as we evaluated this space, which we're very familiar with through extensive diligence and as we evaluated the fit with our own capabilities, we got to a space where we felt that we're very comfortable that we're not just buying a business that is profitable and in a fast-growing category, but one that we can make a significant difference to.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I appreciate it. Thank you.","Steven Austenfeld - Vice President-Investor Relations","Why don't we take two more questions and then we can follow up offline with any others.","Operator","We'll go next to Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, folks. Thank you for the question. I guess I want to come back on the guidance question, or trying to work back into the guidance as we think about next year with the investment. Very simple question. Your long-term algorithm at 25 basis points to 50 basis points of EBIT margin expansion per year, is there any reason to believe that that may be in jeopardy next year as you accelerate the spend?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Jason, again, as I've said, we will provide the outlook in our August call. I think what we did want to foreshadow is major trends and I'll just tick through them. 2 points of FX headwinds, I think that's important. Commodity cost tailwinds, which will likely continue through the fourth quarter, maybe into early part of fiscal 2017. We've got to see. But that's something we're watching closely.","We do intend for the advertising investment, which has really stepped up from about 9% of sales to 10% as a company, we think that's permanent. And I think you'll see us continue to invest at that level of consumer demand-building investment, at least for advertising over time. And I would say that when we look out over the next few years, we feel very good about our EBIT margin expansions, but we need to get more information before we provide an outlook on fiscal 2017 on EBIT margin.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, fair enough, fair enough. You mentioned International and some of the macro headwinds, the currency headwinds, that you're facing there. You came out of the gates this year with some nice progression in turning the margins. They've now turned back against you and pricing is decelerating as FX pressure mounts. What's preventing you from getting the commensurate degree of pricing in these markets as you try to mitigate some of this pressure?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, so we are taking pricing in some of the higher inflationary markets. But it's a balance. We've got a very good track record of taking pricing and, importantly, keeping the pricing that we take and keeping our brands healthy. As much as we would love to be able to price recover all of the FX and inflation, you have to take a measured approach with the consumer so that you do it in a sustainable way.","So I would say that as inflation and FX has squeezed margins, particularly in Argentina and some of these larger countries, we are taking pricing, it is sticking. But we're trying to do it over time. So it will take time to rebuild the margins through pricing. We're doubling down on our cost savings efforts in some of these countries, applying our U.S. capabilities there, which we think makes good sense.","And we're also right-sizing infrastructure investments because we do think the international markets, particularly emerging markets, are going to continue to be challenging. And we want to basically assume a challenging environment and structure accordingly. So I think it's going to take time for us to rebuild the International margins. I do think International will challenge our results in fiscal 2017, but I can also say that I think we're putting in the right long-term plans and executing those well to create a healthy, growing International business for the long-term.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Very good. Thank you. I'll pass it on.","Operator","We'll now take our final question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Just a quick question about your comment earlier on kind of remaining true to your longstanding policies of kind of fair and equitable pricing and deals and relationships with all customers. We all know Walmart is kind of looking to invest in price and looking to its suppliers to help in that. So how do you deal with that in that situation when you have a major customer kind of asking for help to contribute to their business, but you've been so steadfast in how you manage relationships across customers? Anything you can help share there would be great.","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Lauren, as always, we don't comment on specific discussions that we have on any negotiations with customers, but what I can tell you is that our Walmart business continues to be very strong and that we certainly live up to the fair and equitable principle with Walmart in all our discussions that we have.","I'd also remind everybody of what we have consistently said in the past, and that is that the vast majority of our discussions that we have with Walmart are around growth because that's what they're looking for and that's what we can bring. So we talk about how we're investing in their categories. We talk about our innovation, their early adopters on many of our innovations and we talk about how we can grow their categories with both investments and innovation. And we're doing that well.","Right now, again, our business with Walmart remains very healthy and strong. And we're certainly working our hardest to keep it that way, given that they're a major customer. So what I feel most positive about is that the premise that we've always talked about that the two companies, Walmart and Clorox, are so strongly strategically aligned continues to be true.","Where they're investing benefits our company, whether that's in the improvement of store operations, which certainly helps us, for instance, by eliminating out of stocks; whether that's by investing in e-commerce, which, as you know, is a growth platform for us as well, and remains our fastest growing channel, or whether that's their investments in smaller formats like Neighborhood Markets where they really rely on number one and number two brands of which we have so many to drive growth and assortment.","So I continue to feel good about our business with Walmart and I continue to feel good about the progress that we're making based on the focus on how we can grow their categories with our innovation and with our demand spend.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And this concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Dorer, I would now like to turn the program back to you.","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. So to sum up, I'm very pleased with our performance for the third quarter and fiscal year-to-date because we're making the right investments for the long-term health of the company. Our strategies continue to work, and we're delivering strong results for our shareholders and consumers.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Steve Austenfeld, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Mr. Austenfeld, please go ahead sir.","Steve Austenfeld","Great, thank you. Welcome everyone, and thank you for joining Clorox's second quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Don Knauss, Clorox's Chairman and CEO and Steve Robb, our Chief Financial Officer. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com.","Let me remind you that on today's call, we\u2019ll refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures including but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt-to-EBITDA and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations.","Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today\u2019s press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the Financial Results area of our website, as well as in our filings with the SEC. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today\u2019s earnings release.","Please recognize that today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.","With that, I'll now cover highlights of our second quarter business performance by segment. Steve will then address our financial results and our updated outlook for fiscal year \u201914. Finally, Don will close with his perspective on the business, followed by Q&A.","In the second quarter, volume was up a little more than 1% on top of the strong year ago period when volume increased 5% behind our conversion to concentrated bleach, a very strong cold and flu season and strong early season shipments of Charcoal. Given the very strong top-line performance a year ago, we\u2019re very pleased to have delivered volume growth this quarter. Second quarter volume increases in Professional Products, Home Care and International were partially offset by declines in Charcoal and Brita.","Sales for the quarter were up about 0.5 point, with increases in Professional Products, Food and International largely offset by declines in our other businesses. Foreign currency continued to have a meaningful impact on our sales results as the currencies of Argentina, Canada, Australia and several Latin American countries declined meaningfully versus the U.S. dollar. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, sales increased 2.3%.","Our U.S. 13 week market share results reflect a decline of 0.3 points versus the year ago quarter, the same as we reported in the first quarter, reflecting ongoing intense competitive activity.","Over the same period, our categories were essentially flat, following an improvement of 0.7 points in the first quarter. Reduced category growth was driven by a higher level of promotion across several categories, declined in Home Care, Glad, and Filtration, essentially offset by solid category growth in Laundry, Cat Litter and Charcoal. Burt\u2019s Bees, which is not included in the traditional market share data also grew share in a growing category during the quarter.","Now let me turn to our second quarter segment results. Our Cleaning segment volume grew 3% with sales growth trailing slightly at 2% due to negative mix from consumers purchasing larger sized products, as well as additional trade promotion spending to address competitive pressures. That said, we feel very good about positive sales growth in this segment, recognizing we were lapping a record 15% sales growth in the year ago quarter.","Strong double-digit volume growth in Professional Products was driven by gains in our Commercial Cleaning and Health Care businesses. Our Home Care business returned to volume growth, driven by record shipments of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes behind the incremental merchandising plans we discussed with you last quarter. On the innovation front, new Clorox Bath Wipes and Glass Wipes both began shipping in January as we seek to extend Wipes use to new occasions throughout the home.","Volume in our Laundry business was flat driven by increased merchandising support partially offset by lower Green Works laundry detergent shipments due to category softness. As expected, the Bleach category is beginning to slow from recent double-digit increases following compaction to single-digit growth today. That said, our 3D demand building plans for Bleach, which we shared with you at our Analyst Day, are beginning to have an impact.","With increased in-store merchandising, our Bleachable Moments marketing campaign and new advertising noting the significant benefits of Clorox Bleach versus the competition, our market share trends are improving, moving from about a 57% share in the first half to approaching 60% in December. Concentrated bleach also continues to deliver significant gross margin improvement from reduced raw material and transportation cost.","Looking ahead for the Cleaning division, in addition to the new Bath and Glass Wipes I just mentioned, we have a number of other new products launching in the second half, including our new Smart Seek Bleach which began shipping yesterday. Smart Seek Bleach is a breakthrough innovation that whitens white and mostly white clothing without effecting colors. Also last month we began shipping Clorox Fraganzia Bleach. These highly fragranced bleach products are designed to appeal to and attract new consumers particularly in the Hispanic population.","In our Household segment volume and sales each declined 1%. The segment\u2019s top-line results were largely driven by declines in our Charcoal business as we lapped double-digit increases in the year ago quarter. In our Cat Litter business volume was up 1% while sales declined 2% due to increased trade promotion spending. We have plans in place to address the competitive dynamics in Litter overtime with harder hitting advertising and improved packaging, building off recent product improvements that provide our best Odor Control ever.","Volume in our Lifestyle segment decreased 1% while sales were flat. Sales outpaced volume due to the benefit of price increases and lower trade promotion spending. Our food business headed sixth consecutive quarter of higher volume, coupled with strong sales growth driven by increased shipments in dry, dips and dressings. Whereas Burt's Bees volume was flat as the brand faced comparison to a high year ago base from the launch of new whipped color products.","These results were more than offset by top-line decreases on our Brita business due to declines in Pour-Through Filters in the face of expanded private label distribution.","Turning to our International segment, volume increased 2% and sales grew 1%. Sales lagged volume due to currency declines across much of the international business, although pricing and positive mix enabled us to offset much of the foreign currency impact. Excluding the more than 8 percentage points of negative foreign currency impact in the segment, international sales growth would have been about 9%.","With that let me comment on two countries that have been in the news a lot lately, Argentina and Venezuela, where the volatility in both countries continues to make it difficult to forecast our International results. In Argentina which represents about 3.5% of Company sales, we continue to experience inflation of 25% or higher but have been able to cover most of that with price increases. Also our second quarter results from Argentina did benefit by comparing against a lower year ago base period when we were in the midst of completing our IT systems implementation there. Although this quarter\u2019s results were better than anticipated, we are closely monitoring the recent currency devaluation in the peso for the impact it would have on our results.","In Venezuela, which represents about 2% of Company sales, we also continued to experience very high inflation, at times north of 50% while only having the ability to take pricing due to government controls or non-regulated items which have made up about a third of our portfolio. As a result our Venezuela business is not profitable based on recently reported results. Although we continue to face challenges in these two countries, we\u2019re pleased to have grown the sales and profit in International during the second quarter. We continue to invest in our faster growing markets and have confidence our investment plans will further strengthen results overtime.","Looking at the full fiscal year, we have lowered our total Company sales growth outlook to 1% to 2%, factoring in an updated outlook for the impact of foreign currency declines and continued sluggish category growth. Our outlook also continues to include higher year-over-year trade spending to address competitive dynamics. That said on a currency neutral basis, we anticipate sales growth to be 3% to 4% for the fiscal year.","In addition, we remain encouraged by our innovation plans as we feel confident in our ability to meet or exceed our annual goal of 3 points of incremental sales from innovation driven by products launched last fall, as well as those coming out in the next month or so.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve Robb.","Steve Robb","Thanks Steve and welcome everyone. As Steve mentioned we grew sales on top of a challenging comparison to the year ago quarter and sales increased 9% in the current quarter, scooting the impact of foreign currencies sales were up 2.3%.","Turning to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter, the 5% decline compares to a strong 18% growth in the year ago period, which included a gain of $0.03 from the sale lease back of our Oakland headquarters building. Unfavorable foreign currencies also impacted the current quarter results by about $0.05.","With that, I\u2019ll take you through the details of our second quarter financial results and then discuss our outlook for fiscal \u201914.","In the second quarter, we grew sales about 0.5 percentage point reflecting more than a point of volume growth and about 2 points of pricing benefit. These factors were partially offset by about 2 points of foreign currency declines across multiple countries. Gross margin for the current quarter came in at 41.9%, a decline of 60 basis points. For the quarter we delivered 20 million in cost savings or 150 basis points and about 70 basis points from pricing primarily in international markets. These benefits were offset by nearly 140 basis points of commodity cost primarily from resin, as well as more than 120 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs due to continued high inflation in international markets particularly Venezuela and Argentina.","Selling and administrative expense for the second quarter was 15% of sales, a slight improvement versus year ago quarter, primarily driven by lower employee incentive compensation, cost savings and lapping infrastructure-related investments. These results were partially offset by the impact of inflation in international markets and one-time costs associated with the transition to new IT service providers.","Advertising spending for the current quarter was more than 9% of sales as expected reflecting increased support for our brands globally with our U.S. retail business spending at about 10% of sales.","Our second quarter tax rate of 35.6% on earnings from continuing operations was more than a point higher versus the year ago quarter, reducing diluted earnings per share by $0.02. We continue to anticipate a tax rate of about 34% for the full fiscal year. Net of all of the factors I have discussed today, in the second quarter we delivered diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.88.","Turning to cash flow, our year-to-date free cash flow was 149 million versus 223 million in the same period a year ago. This decrease is the result of higher tax payments, as well as the Company\u2019s funding of liabilities under certain non-qualified deferred compensation plans partially offset by lower capital expenditures.","We anticipate the higher tax payments in the first half of the fiscal year to be offset by lower tax payments over the balance of the fiscal year. We also continue to anticipate free cash flow as a percentage of net sales to be about 10% of sales for the fiscal year. For the quarter, we ended with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.2 at the low-end of our targeted range of 2 to 2.5.","Now I\u2019ll turn to our fiscal year 2014 outlook. As you saw from our press release, we updated our sales and earnings outlook primarily due to the significant 19% devaluation of the Argentine peso in January. As Steve mentioned we now anticipate sales growth to be in the range of 1% to 2%, reflecting more than 2 points of continuing foreign currency declines for the full year and up to 3 points of impact in the second half of the fiscal year.","Looking forward, we anticipate further devaluation of the Argentine peso through the remainder of the fiscal year. From perspective of the 1 point decrease in our sales outlook, about half relates to foreign currency headwinds and the balance reflects sluggish U.S. category growth. We are now assuming U.S. category growth rates below the 1% level we had previously factored into our last outlook. Higher year-over-year trade spending in the back half of the fiscal year will also temper sales growth.","Turning to gross margin, we anticipate gross margin for the full fiscal year to be down modestly reflecting the margin impact of our updated foreign exchange outlook and slightly stronger commodity cost headwinds. All other assumptions about gross margin remain generally the same, including an anticipated benefit of 150 basis points from cost savings offset by about 100 basis points of negative impact from inflation affecting manufacturing and logistics costs.","In the face of elevated commodity costs, we continue to take pricing actions in International where possible to help offset both inflation and foreign currency declines. In addition, we recently announced a price increase of 6% on our Glad trash business to offset the rising cost of resin. This increase will take effect in March of this year. We continue to expect our fiscal year EBIT margin range to be flat to up 25 basis points. This range reflects lower selling and administrative expense as a percentage of sales likely about 14% of sales consistent with our long-term goal of reducing this line item.","Our fiscal year \u201914 EBIT margin will also benefit from a shift of advertising to trade promotion spending to address competitive promotional activity. Advertising levels will also continue to be impacted by reduced investments in challenged international markets particularly Argentina and Venezuela. As a result, we now expect advertising spending for the full fiscal year to be slightly less than 9% of sales. Importantly our U.S. retail business continues to expect advertising spending to be between 9% and 10% of sales.","As we mentioned in our press release, although it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll see additional currency devaluations in Venezuela, our fiscal 2014 outlook does not assume further devaluation of the Venezuela currency beyond the February 2013 devaluation. Net of all of these factors, we now anticipate diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.40 to $4.55, for fiscal year \u201914. The $0.05 reduction versus our previous outlook reflects the Company\u2019s new foreign currency exchange assumptions primarily for Argentina.","In closing, I feel very good about our overall results for the first half of the fiscal year, particularly our ability to deliver 3% sales growth on a currency neutral basis, this on top of a comparison to strong sales growth in the year ago period.","Looking to the second half of the fiscal year, foreign currency headwinds and sluggish category growth will continue to weigh on our results. We\u2019re responding with innovation and more aggressive trade spending, as well as a continued focus on our operational efficiencies.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Don.","Don Knauss","Okay, thank you, Steve and hello to everyone on the call. So as I reflect on the quarter, I do think we performed well growing volume and sales on top of a very high year ago base that both Steve\u2019s referenced. And that year ago base of course was really driven by the launch of concentrated bleach and strong innovation pipeline and a double-digit increase in charcoal volume that we had.","Importantly, I think it\u2019s good to note that we realized volume gains in 6 out of the 9 U.S. business units and for the total U.S. volume was up 1% on top of very strong results a year ago. So I\u2019m particularly pleased with this quarter\u2019s top-line performance in International, which delivered 2% volume growth and 1% sales growth despite the material foreign currency headwinds we faced.","In fact as Steve mentioned on a currency neutral basis, International sales grew 9% in the quarter. Interestingly, the biggest driver of this was Latin America which delivered 4% sales growth overall, but when you back out its 11% FX hit. LATAM for us delivered 15% sales growth on a currency neutral basis, very strong growth. And as mentioned, we have updated our outlook for foreign currency declines and sluggish category growth with sales now expected to grow about 1% to 2% for the year or about 3% to 4% on a currency neutral basis.","So as discussed, commodity cost increases particularly in resin and increased manufacturing and logistics cost driven by inflation primarily in international market continue to put pressure on Q2 margins.","Now at the same time, we continue to drive efficiencies across the Company and really do remain on-track to achieve our cost savings targets for the fiscal year. We also had success in taking price in some international markets and as Steve noted, have announced a price increase on Glad that we really believe will help offset the rising resin cost. Now we remain highly focused on keeping our core healthy and we\u2019re committed to regaining market share, and I feel very good about our plans across our portfolio and including a strong innovation pipeline in this half of the fiscal year to really drive some improved share results in the second half of the year.","We\u2019re particularly pleased with the improving trends for Clorox liquid bleach, for perspective we just received our January share trends and for the month Clorox liquid bleach grew share to two tenths of the share point to 60.7, now that\u2019s our highest share on Clorox liquid bleach in 10 months. So we\u2019re pleased that the programs we put in place are working. In addition, Clorox 2 Color Booster & Stain Fighter grew two tenths of the share point to 27.3. So we\u2019re pleased to see improving health across the two largest brands in our Laundry portfolio. And we expect our investment plans to yield future market share improvements in the second half of the fiscal year.","I do think our second quarter results are demonstrating that our 3D demand-building capabilities are gaining traction here. We\u2019re investing and supporting our brands with new merchandizing plans along with national advertising and influence our campaigns and we\u2019re working with our retailer partners to grow our categories.","I think as many of you saw in October at the Analyst Day session here, our second half innovation pipeline is strong and with new products being launched in nearly every business and we are on-track to achieve 3 points of sales growth from innovation in the fiscal year consistent with the objective we set.","Now looking further out, we do believe the unfavorable foreign exchange rates that are currently impacting sales will stabilize over the long-term. And we continue to anticipate that our U.S. retail categories which grew about a 0.5 in calendar year \u201912 and about another point in calendar year \u201913 will overtime maintain the long-term growth rates of 1% to 2% we\u2019ve projected consistent with population growth in an improving U.S. economy. We also remain very optimistic about our innovation capabilities in the pipeline to deliver an average of 3 points of incremental growth from innovation annually.","So with that, let\u2019s go to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll go first to Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Research","Hi, I have two questions, if I may. First on, we\u2019ve all heard from Church & Dwight this morning that they\u2019re launching a new OxiClean product sort of directly head-to-head against bleach sort of a bleach alterative. Number one, is that factored into your plans? Number two, do you think you\u2019ll lose shelf space to them? Does that affect your thinking at all?","And then just secondarily, Steve, I wanted to go back to the comment you made that manufacturing and logistics cost your gross margin 120 basis points primarily because of the international markets and that just seems like a very large impact on your profitability given how relatively small Venezuela and Argentina are. So I guess the question is, is there anything more you can do to mitigate the margin impact of the devaluation because it just seems like a big number to me? Thanks.","Don Knauss","Yes, Wendy, thanks. Don, here. Let me take the first half of the question on bleach and Oxi and then I\u2019ll turn it to Steve. I think in general we feel very good about our bleach plants for the second half, it didn\u2019t anticipate another new product from Church & Dwight but I think the program we\u2019ve out in place did anticipate significant competitive spending. So for example our trade spending on Laundry is definitely up in the second half of the year, the innovation pipeline as you know Wendy with smart seeking bleach which we think has helped offset some of the claims around bleach being harmful to a wider range of clothing options, it helps us also with a value launch of Fraganzia and also a value launch on our Tupac bleach. We think we\u2019ve got a lot of innovation out there and stronger trade support, so we think we\u2019re -- and as I noted in January we have already starting to see some share gain for the first time in 10 months, so we feel very good about the plans we have in place and think we can take on the competitive issue.","Steve Robb","So Wendy, this is Steve, let me provide a perspective on the manufacturing and logistics cost, so as you noted, it increased about 120 basis points, a lot of this is coming from high inflation markets of Venezuela, Argentina and other Latin American countries. We are obviously taking steps through the cost savings programs to mitigate it, for perspective the 120 basis points represents about $16 million and the total cost savings in cost of goods sold was about 20 million in the quarter and if fact if you look at all of the lines of the P&L, the total cost savings was closer to 30 million.","So we think the combination of leaning into the cost savings programs, taking pricing where we can and the belief that over the very long-term both in Venezuela and Argentina we\u2019ll be able to get pricing, we\u2019d be able to mitigate that, but certainly the gross margins this fiscal year will be challenged because we\u2019re not likely to recover all of the commodity costs and inflationary pressures we\u2019re seeing but we have got a pretty good track-record over the long-term move offsetting these costs with pricing and cost savings.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Research","Okay. And then just to clarify on the bleach thing, Don, you\u2019re not expecting to lose any shelf space this year over the next six months in bleach, is that right?","Don Knauss","Yes, we don\u2019t anticipate that Wendy because of the innovation behind the Tupac, the new Fraganzia line items and also some new scents on king size we don\u2019t anticipate that.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Research","Terrific. Okay, thank you so much.","Don Knauss","Thanks Wendy.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Olivia Tom with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tom - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Wanted to talk a little bit about promotion, because that continues to be a big topic for both you and your peers, and I\u2019m just wondering how do you think all this plays out because it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re going to take your foot of the pedal, nor are any of your competitors, so then it\u2019s just, everyone going to operate at a new lower normal, or how do you think that plays out?","And then how is the retail reaction been so far to smart bleach obviously you just shipped so there\u2019s no consumer reaction yet, but can you remind us how that\u2019s going to be merchandized is it a trade up for current bleach users, is it a stain fighter, so potentially it can go against this new OxiClean product and essentially where do you expect that share to come from? Thank you.","Don Knauss","Olivia, let me take the last part of your question on smart seeking bleach, we priced it at line pricing to our regular bleach so that we could get, cold merchandizing together. We think it\u2019s going to expand use education for bleach, that\u2019s what we think particularly among millennials where they don\u2019t typically wear just pure white clothing, so we think it\u2019s an expansion of the use education for bleach and we expect it to be merchandized and shelved along with regular bleach and as I\u2019ve said that\u2019s why we priced it on a line pricing basis so we could get, cold merchandizing.","Because we would expect people to potentially buy both bleaches, one we\u2019re seeing more and more usage of regular bleach in cleaning around the home, particularly during flu season and obviously smart seeking bleach more used ideally in the laundry room.","Now as far as promotion goes, as you say everybody is amping up promotional spending, our spending in the first half of the year was essentially flat on trade spending, we are seeing as I noted a ramp-up in the second half particularly between behind those brands that have challenged from a share standpoint, particularly Laundry, Home Care, Litter, and Glad, so that\u2019s where you\u2019re going to primarily see the increases.","Most of our increases are behind innovation spending except in the case of bleach where we\u2019re getting one incremental event basically as we get back into the regular merchandizing calendar, so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a new normal, I think everybody is obviously trying to, from a retail standpoint, trying to generate traffic, I think they\u2019re using number one brands to do that which bodes well for us. I\u2019ve met with about 15 retailers three weeks ago at the FMI Midwinter Conference in Arizona, and I think the biggest issue, all of them basically talked about was getting traffic back into their stores.","So I think you\u2019re going to continue to see aggressive activity on everybody\u2019s part to help get that traffic but again, number one brands are really what\u2019s in their forefront in their mind to get the traffic private label, focusing on private label is not getting traffic in the stores and they recognize that.","Don Knauss","Well the only thing I\u2019d add is that, we\u2019ve seen this before they, you tend to go in cycles with light or heavy promotional activity and it\u2019s particularly heeded right now to your point but as the retailers try to lap this going forward and with their quest for same-store sales growth eventually they\u2019re going to get back to more call it rational pricing it had some degree of rationality in the category so making it growth again.","Olivia Tom - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Thanks and if I could just call up on one thing, in your prepared comments you talked about mix shift is a larger packs and I remember a couple of years back that was an issue but more recently I thought that people had switched to smaller packs maybe not willing to go as far to the stores with the larger packs, is that a shift back or is this just kind of ebbs and flows.","Steve Robb","This is Steve. I think it just comes as ebbs and flows, if you look at the fiscal year-to-date margin the impact of mix has been fairly benign from the first half of this fiscal year. But again, over the long-term I think as consumers have more money they tend to shift up to larger more value-oriented sizes which is one of the reasons our cost savings programs look at trying to take cost out of the system to try to mitigate that, but not a big issue for this fiscal year in terms of the first half and ongoing though I think it\u2019s going to be a trend you\u2019ll continue to see.","Olivia Tom - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Hi. Can you just give us a little bit more color on what\u2019s going on in Wipes because, I know it\u2019s not the bulk of the sales but the scanner data looked a lot worse than the growth you reported. So, I know it\u2019s obviously the Costco business, was there anything we should keep in mind kind of as we model the lap for next year?","Don Knauss","I think Bill, on Wipes. I think you\u2019ll start to see the share losses that we\u2019ve sustained reserve themselves out in the fourth quarter as we saw a lot of private label activity in some of our larger customers that started last April. So, you\u2019ll start to lap that. I think the other thing that you\u2019ll see is obviously the new innovation from us behind glass and tub and shower wipes is helping. And I think what I\u2019m hearing from retailers as well as they start to lap the private label push particularly some of the largest retailers we have. They\u2019re hungry for growth because they\u2019re already starting to see the category slow.","If you look at -- this is the category that\u2019s been growing in mid to high single-digits. If you look at the last quarter, the category actually declined two tenths of a point and if you look at January it declined 3.2 points. So, I think people are finally recognizing you can\u2019t grow this category if you have got a 50 share brand setting on the sidelines.","So, I think you\u2019re going to see through our innovation and also increased merchandising focus in the, not only this quarter but the fourth quarter we\u2019ll start to see those share declines reserve and I think you\u2019ll start to see a little bit more robust category going forward.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Got you. But it grew in the quarter, right? So, was there difference maybe with\u2026","Don Knauss","They grew substantially in the quarter because of as you said, we have a strong Costco business, club business which wasn\u2019t reflected in those numbers and also the professional side of our wipes business grew substantially as well.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Thanks. And then is there any more activity on sort of professional products acquisition front. Because it seems like we hit a little bit of a low and that was obviously a huge priority and I know it\u2019s still a very fragmented business. So, are you still in kind of integration phase before you kind of look for new properties to add in or is it just lack of available properties right now?","Don Knauss","We have pretty robust pipeline of targets and companies that we\u2019re interested in again keep in mind many of these are smaller bolt-on acquisitions that are held by families and others and we\u2019re going to continue to work the pipeline we haven\u2019t had anything as you say in the last year or so after we completed AppleCare and Health Link. But we have money to spend. We\u2019re actively looking for deals and we think over the next couple of years we ought to be able to get some more bolt-on acquisitions but it takes time to work these.","Steve Robb","Bill I think just to help and give you all some perspective on that business and the help of that business fiscal year-to-date that recall that at the Analyst Day we walked about that part of the business growing 10% to 15% annually. That business through the first half of the fiscal is at the upper-end of that range lapping over 50% growth in the year ago half. So, that business organically is really coming on strong and continues to be a real growth driver.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thank you so much.","Don Knauss","Okay. Thanks Bill.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein","Hi guys. Just a follow-up again on the M&A piece, so it\u2019s professional is still the number one priority in terms of acquisitions. So that you don\u2019t have that much more interest in some of these OTC properties that are coming on the market or the healthcare business for Kimberly or anything like that. It\u2019s still these kind of smaller roll up plays in professionals, is that a fair assessment?","Don Knauss","Yes Ali. I think that\u2019s a very fair assessment. What we\u2019ve said to-date is stopping the spread of infections in the professional space with these bolt-on acquisitions that\u2019s center of play for us. We\u2019re also open to looking at bolt-on acquisitions in core CPG brands where we think we can add value, things like Soy Vay and other brands and that continues to be the primary focus for us. These larger acquisitions they tend to have a lot of happy sellers and less happy buyers in our experience, so never say never if there is a good deal that comes along but at this point we think bolt-ons in the spaces that we\u2019ve identified are right.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then on this trade spends. I am coming at a sense of how much more it will be in the back half of the year and then perhaps even ongoing. The helpful gross margin driver chart that you showed over the past couple of years, the price changes have been 100 basis points plus and very much over, much higher than the market movement or the commodities number they have and now they\u2019ve dropped down to kind of a 75 or 70 or 80 basis point level.","And again from your discussion it sounds like a lot of that is trade spend and I\u2019m just trying to figure out as you go forward how much more trade spend, how much less maybe price change should we expect in this gross margin chart as we look forward given the competitive intensity you\u2019re feeling and the retailer pressure you\u2019re feeling?","Don Knauss","Yes, you got a couple of questions embedded in there. Let me say the second half trade spending will be higher than what we saw in the year ago period. In part because what we\u2019re allocating spending out of advertising over to trade to drive some of the merchandizing and some of the new products that we have coming up so don\u2019t want to quantify a specific number but you will see the number is going up and that\u2019s part of the plan that we have to vigorously defend our market shares.","In terms of the price changes, in the second quarter we had about 70 basis points of lift from pricing, I would expect that overtime, the number is going to continue to hopefully go up but a lot of it depends on our ability to get pricing in some of these international markets like Venezuela and Argentina.","In the U.S., you will see us price to recover long-term commodity cost and other inflationary pressure. So commodities go up we\u2019re likely to take more pricing, if commodities stay benign we\u2019ll take less. So that number is going to float up and down based on what we see with inflation and commodity cost.","Steve Robb","I think Ali just to be clear, as we do allocate some more demand spending behind trade, particularly behind new products in the second half the U.S. retail advertising and consumer promotion number is still going to remain in the 9% to 10% range whether it\u2019s been for the last couple of years.","In fact, this quarter it was at 10% for U.S. retail. So we still feel strong about maintaining at least the mid to high 9s in the U.S. retail even as we allocate some of the spending out of particularly troubled international markets where it just doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense to put TV on or other forms of mass media when we have price controls.","Don Knauss","Ali also just a point of clarification.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein","Yes.","Don Knauss","That table that you\u2019re referring to, which is I believe attached to our earnings release and I know it\u2019s on our website, that price changes are strictly a rate change for price. It\u2019s a rate impact it doesn\u2019t reflect changes in trade spending. I think to the extent that you see trade spending increase in the second half of the year that will probably be reflected more in the all other line.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein","Understood, that\u2019s actually the clarification. Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Because I thought that was net of trade spending.","Don Knauss","No, that\u2019s strictly rate adjusted price.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein","Okay, so then the all other would go up. Because currently you\u2019re not I mean Steve to your point Steve Robb to your point, you\u2019re not offsetting the commodity movements at this point with what you\u2019re seeing from a price change, rate price change perspective and you expect that gap to close going forward?","Steve Robb","I think over the long-term it will close. But there is always a lag, so we took a 6% price increase on the Glad business as an example to reflect the higher cost that we\u2019re seeing in resin. But we\u2019re taking that in March, it\u2019s going to take a couple of months to sell through. So, pricing we try to price as much as we can to the long-term average cost of commodity but there tends to be a bit of a lag. And so I think over the very long-term we remain confident in our ability to protect our gross margins. But you are seeing a lag. And again as we\u2019ve said many times, unfortunately the price controls in Argentina and Venezuela just add to that certainly in the short to intermediate term.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein","Okay. And sorry, just a quick on your -- on the quick clarification on the free cash flow to sales at 10%. That\u2019s a step up starting at quarter, right? I mean, the taxes and the pensions effectively go away this quarter and that\u2019s a step up to get to that 10%, right? It\u2019s not a ramp-up. Is that fair?","Steve Robb","Yes. You will see free cash flow as a percentage of sales significantly better in the second half than the first half, and that should get us to the 10%, because the tax payments in our estimate are essentially timing. We expect to go offset in the second half.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein","Okay, thanks very much.","Steve Robb","Thanks Robert.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo.","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities","Thanks guys. I just wanted to go back on Cleaning for a second, right I mean so obviously the volume growth is pretty heroic on that comparison. And it sounds like Wipes were up again better than what the scanner data would have indicated. But can you just talk about I guess how bigger deal were the Bath and Glass Wipes and how sustainable was that? And I guess is there anything going on at inventory levels at the trade with those products? I mean is everything kind of normalized?","Don Knauss","Yes. Chris, on the Wipes business in the quarter, it was really driven by merchandising support as the flu season ramped-up and particularly in December, it was really tied to some incremental activity behind merchandising and some of the larger customers behind Wipes. Obviously Glass, Wipes and tub and shower wipes did not ship until January. So they really didn\u2019t impact the quarter at all. So I think as I said about the second half of the year, we\u2019re going to start to see obviously improved performance on Wipes behind the innovation, behind ramped-up trade spending, resulting in more merchandising events going into the back half as well as lapping, starting in April, this significant push by private label for the few key customers.","So a lot of the October, November, December, Wipes business was driven by incremental merchandising activities getting secondary locations in the number of retailers, not only in the club channel but in the grocery channel as well in pharmacies across the country. So I think a lot of guys learned from last year when the flu season ramped up, that they needed to get secondary location. So we had a lot of shippers out there, a lot of incremental locations.","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities","So do you feel like, I mean, so if this cold and flu season to the extent that it\u2019s less a deal than it was last cold and flu season all of the secondary points of distribution, is that essentially end up amount at the inventory into channel or does it not work that way?","Don Knauss","No I think we\u2019ve seen pretty good sell through. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve heard from any retailers that we\u2019ve got a lot of hanging inventory at all particularly because the flu season this year really got more aggressive in late December and early January, through January, than it did last year. And last year remember the flu season was really ramping up in November, and this year it\u2019s been October and November, this year it\u2019s been more or like December and January.","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities","Got it. Got it. And then just on Argentina. It sounds like you guys said that with mix in pricing, you\u2019ve been able to offset the currency devaluation so far. And relative to the $0.05 to $0.10 you guys have baked into the guidance, I mean, do you feel like again incremental devaluation aside, has that $0.05 to $0.10 been sort of an over-management of that like did you even need the $0.05 to $0.10 so far?","Don Knauss","Yes. The $0.05 to $0.10 was primarily designed to cover for the operating challenges in Venezuela the high rates of inflation, the price controls and it\u2019s certainly embedded in the outlook that we\u2019ve shared with everyone today. And we\u2019re using that, as Steve mentioned and as I\u2019ve mentioned before, we\u2019re losing money in Venezuela now. And we have lost money in the first half of the fiscal year, fully expect to lose money in the second half of the fiscal year and the $0.05 to $0.10 really covers for that cost.","The Argentina business excluding currency effects is actually performing quite well. From an operating standpoint I think the team is doing a very nice job there, but unfortunately what we\u2019re starting to see now with the devaluation in some of challenges, it\u2019s going to certainly make for a much more difficult second half in Argentina.","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities","","Got it thanks guys.","","Don Knauss","","Thanks Chris.","","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John Faucher - JPMorgan","Thank you. Just to follow-up on Chris\u2019s question. If we look back at your Brazil business which you guys had exited if I remember correctly. Is there a way to sort of look out four year or five years on the Argentina and Venezuela businesses and say okay, here\u2019s where we think we need to be is it a situation where you could manage the portfolio down, sell fewer products. I guess the real question is are there structural options from a more aggressive stance to manage these businesses going forward or do you just, at this point need to sort of ride things out.","Don Knauss","I think it\u2019s -- each country is a bit different, Argentina again that business has done really well for us, we know how to ride the ups and downs and obviously when it goes up it feels pretty good and when it goes down it\u2019s a bit more challenging. But that\u2019s a business that we think we\u2019re taking all of the right actions to make sure that we keep the very lean cost structure, we keep those brands healthy and we kind of whether the storm if you will. So I feel very good about that business over the long-term.","And Venezuela is actually a much more challenging situation for us, it\u2019s a business that historically has been very profitable, one of our better businesses. And certainly the brand equities and I think are holding up very nicely. The challenge we have is we have got inflation that\u2019s running north of 50% and we have got the government that\u2019s imposed price controls on more than two-thirds of our portfolio, and as a result the business has gone from profitability to losses.","What we need to assess I think over the next couple of quarters year or so, is number one, our ability get pricing through and that\u2019s where the government\u2019s going to have to kind of weigh in and say are you going to let companies take pricing or not? And second what\u2019s going to happen with the currency? Because we\u2019re currently translating that business at a CADIVI of 6.3 to 1, if you look at the parallel market it\u2019s in the high 70s, so it\u2019s pretty big gap there.","So I think the combination of understanding what\u2019s going to happen with the currency as well as price controls will probably inform longer-term, what do we want to do in that business?","Steve Robb","John the only thing I would add is, if you look at Argentina for example, I mean Argentina in this quarter grew over 9% in sales and over 5% in volume. So from an operating standpoint and that\u2019s not currency neutral, that\u2019s in U.S. dollar. So strong operating performance in Argentina, we did get pricing through on a number of products in October, so we\u2019re doing quite a bit better than forecast in Argentina, and as Steve said the wild-card here is the inflation rate and the currency issues going into the second half. I think from an operating standpoint we\u2019re doing the right things.","In Venezuela there are structural things that we are changing, I am giving you an example. We used to have a, for example double-digit SKUs of bleach; we\u2019re going down into a handful of SKUs on bleach so we would run the lines more efficiently. There are a number of things we have done to lower our cost structure and be prudent so that while we\u2019re losing a modest amount of money year-to-date in Venezuela we\u2019re better than we forecasted going into the year. So the team is making some improvements there.","There are trigger points at down the road where we say when we look at inflation rates, we look at the operating efficiencies, we\u2019re getting the ability to take pricing for example, we\u2019re having ongoing dialog with the government. I think the government is starting to realize a number of businesses are in a very tough spot, and they are going to have to do something if these businesses want to keep producing. And I don\u2019t think they want essential products like bleach out of production.","So there are number of things that we\u2019re doing, but I would say both in Argentina and Venezuela given the changes we have made, we\u2019re doing better forecast and we are starting to see some vibrancy in Argentina.","Don Knauss","John I think it\u2019s also helps to remember that, when we exited Brazil, I mean that was many, many years ago. We had a very fragmented relatively low market share business. I think it\u2019s hard to remember Venezuela and Argentina these are very strong market share businesses. In fact Argentina which is the bigger of the two countries for us, either of that market shares that are equal to if not north of some of our U.S. market shares, so we have got very strong businesses there.","John Faucher - JPMorgan","Okay, great. And then one sort of unrelated follow-up question which is Cat Litter, which you guys have talked a lot about, you showed us some new products at your Analyst Day. We\u2019re hearing more about this category, we have seen packaging improvements, new product improvements. Is this is a category where you can push the consumer that far ahead so that she is willing to pay more, because it seems to be getting more competitive and can you really grow the profit full in that category with this much activity?","Don Knauss","Well I think you can John I think if you look at some of the recent success that one of our competitors had with a light weighting product that is a significant premium price to what the normal litter is in the category. So we think it is a category that the last 13 weeks has grown a little bit north of 5%. We think the demographic trends are great. We do have some significant innovation coming that we think out flanks competition, and our odor control is better than it\u2019s ever been, our trade spending will go up on this business, in the second half we\u2019re going to defend these shares.","So I think the combination of innovation and trade spending and packaging basically all elements of the marketing mix, everybody\u2019s hair is on fire over here to get this thing turned around. And I think we have the plans in place to do it and I do think it\u2019s a category that has terrific trend and demographics in its favor.","John Faucher - JPMorgan","Great, thanks.","Operator","And we will go next to Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","Hi, good afternoon everyone.","Don Knauss","Hey, Javier.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","Hello. I have a question with regards to the guidance, right. If I go through the release you have got higher commodities, greater currency impact, you are facing a lower category growth and you need to hone on an increasing trade spending. So, it looks as if you have a lot of headwinds to offset with only 1 point of pricing at a corporate level at the end of the third quarter which corresponds to what you are doing in Glad and you just lower guidance by 1 point. Is this enough of reset in terms of to deliver your earnings forecast? And then I have another question.","Steve Robb","So Javier, this is Steve. Let me try to provide you perspective. So, in our previous outlook we had anticipated sales growth in the range of 2% to 3%. And as I\u2019ve mentioned in my opening comments the devaluation of the Argentine peso was significantly larger than we had anticipated. So, we do think that bringing this down from 2 to 3 to 1 to 2 to reflect the new foreign exchange assumptions and somewhat slower U.S. category growth makes sense. And basically that implies that we have got 3% to 4% currency neutral sales growth on the full year and Ali just pointed out in the first half of the fiscal year sales growth on a currency neutral basis was about 3%, so it implies 3% to 4% growth in the second half. We think that\u2019s very reasonable.","From an earnings per share standpoint we did drop the range by a nickel in the top and the bottom that was to deal with the FX assumption change for Argentina. Commodity costs are about what we thought in the previous outlook, they are up a little bit but not a lot. Trade spending is expected to be elevated in the second half but again not much different than what we have thought in the previous outlook. So, we do feel that this outlook is balanced and anticipates a range of assumptions. The biggest open item would be what happens with Venezuela and that\u2019s the one we are watching carefully.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","Okay. The second question has to do with the increase in trade promotions, Church & Dwight said it today that they are going to do the same. So, how big of an increase in shelf space whatever you are going to do buys you and for how long, so I wonder whether these payments that you are going to do to the trade, are going to benefit through 2015 or just a one quarter thing, just to support innovation and that\u2019s it?","Don Knauss","Yes I think Javier, the elevation in trade spending is concentrated on a few businesses. I don\u2019t think you will see it, you are not going to see it across the board. For example we just talked about litter, you are going to see clearly support behind new products there and support behind incremental merchandizing events. So, it\u2019s not really payment for shelf space as much as it\u2019s payment for feature and display activity and whether that continues into FY15, we will see how the dynamics in the category go. But it\u2019s really more of display and feature support behind new products and increased frequency of events. Than it is anything to do with slotting allowances or anything like that.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","Okay. Thank you.","Don Knauss","Thanks, Javier.","Operator","And we will go next to Michael Steib to Credit Suisse.","Michael Steib - Credit Suisse","Hi, I have two questions if I may. And the first is on Burt's Bees, you mentioned that growth was flat in the quarter, is that entirely due to just a comparison base and should we therefore expect growth to pick up in the second half of the year? And then the second question is on the concentrated bleach formula, can you just confirm that that\u2019s back on the normal merchandizing cycle, so does that also support volume growth in the second half?","Don Knauss","Yes, Michael on Burt\u2019s, there was a significant growth last year. So, you are right. The interesting thing is while it was flat in the quarter consumption was up 7% and the category was up 4%. So, we gained share and consumption was in the high single-digits, so we feel good about we are lapping these big inventories moving last year with the new lip products but consumption looks strong.","In fact consumption in January on Burt\u2019s was up 11%, so we feel like the trends are very good on Burt\u2019s and there is some interesting innovation coming on color for lip in the second half of the year. On, would you repeat your question on bleach, I couldn\u2019t quite hear it?","Michael Steib - Credit Suisse","Back in the merchandizing segment.","Don Knauss","Yes, the bleach cycle, I think one of things you are seeing with the January share increase to 60.7 we hit in January as we are getting back into the normal cadence. We are up about one full event which is about 15% to 20% increase in merchandizing activity for the year. So, we are back more into a normal cadence now on bleach. And I think as we go through the balance of the fiscal you will continue to see the share position improve particularly behind the new products that are out there.","Michael Steib - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you very much.","Don Knauss","Thanks.","Operator","And we will go next to Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital Markets.","Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets","Hi, I have a question on Venezuela of course. We are hearing a couple of things, one is that instead of devaluation there in the form of an event where the government would say we are devaluing by 40%. That there might be a rolling devaluation sort of unannounced but every month or every so often the prices change, are you seeing that in your operations yet and is the rolling devaluation easier or harder to manage? And then I have a follow-up.","Don Knauss","We\u2019d say it\u2019s actually a hard question to answer. The government has come out and publicly said there is no devaluation, the CADIVI remains to 6, 3. Concurrent with that, they have run C Cat auctions and while they have not published these rates. The market would seem to indicate that they\u2019re running between 11 and cal it 14. So it\u2019s a form of a stealth devaluation, we have not been able to participate in the C Cat auction to-date at least successfully. So it\u2019s fairly clearly unclear to us what is the exchange rate we\u2019re all going to have to use and for what transactions and what will the rates be.","And I think we\u2019re waiting to get additional clarity on what does this multi-tiered exchange rate system look like and then what does it mean, if you\u2019ve got dual exchange rates. And the CADIVI has held at 6, 3 and then C Cat or something else continues to devalue. So lot more questions than answers. I think the only that\u2019s certain is that the Venezuelan Bolivar is significantly overvalued. And probably the good news is the Venezuela business for Clorox is something less than 2% of sales, so it\u2019s an important business, but it\u2019s not the biggest thing that we\u2019ve got in the portfolio.","Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets","Yes, well that brings up the follow-up question. This has been going on since 2010 where every so often you have to takeout $0.10 to $0.20 from your earnings outlook for a business that\u2019s 2% of sales. So when do you decide if this is really strategic or why bother it at all?","Don Knauss","First of all I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s completely accurate Connie. In 2011, we had an all-time record of profitability in Venezuela, so I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s been going on for three years. It\u2019s really been the last 18 to 24 months when things have changed dramatically.","Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets","Okay.","Don Knauss","But as I said, we\u2019ve taken structural changes to lower the cost structure of that business. As I said, the team is performing better that we had forecast. We\u2019re looking at a comprehensive plan to say, okay, how do we stay and then we want to stay in this country for the long-term because it has been over the last 10 years, one of the best, if not the best performing countries in Latin America for us.","So, we\u2019re making it more efficient. We\u2019re having dialogue with the government. I think we\u2019re getting at a tipping point whether the government is going to have to sit down with a number of businesses and just say, look, if you want us to stay here long-term you are going to have to give us a reasonable profit margin. And we\u2019ll be having that dialogue in the next 30, 60, 90 days with the government.","Clearly, we don\u2019t like the situation we\u2019re in through fiscal \u201914, but we\u2019re doing better with than forecast and it\u2019s not going to be a significant drag unless there is another major devaluation going forward.","Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets","Thanks, very much.","Don Knauss","Okay Connie.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital","Thanks, good afternoon. First question was just on private label. The mention of it in the release and I think on the call, so with Brita filters that was actually the first time I\u2019d heard about that, so could you just, is that a newer dynamic? How prevalent this private label? Has there been in shifts in shelf space? And do you at this point have any plans to kind of be able to stay ahead of that becoming a more lasting trend?","Don Knauss","Yes Lauren, it\u2019s primarily in one customer, a large customer, but it\u2019s in one customer. And we do have plans to change our filters over the next two quarters. So, you\u2019ll see a very different filter structure for us coming out and we think it addresses this issue.","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital","And will those different filters then require new pitchers too?","Don Knauss","Well, put it this way, the new filter will be unique at how it fits into our pitcher.","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital","Okay. Okay. Great. And then second thing which is I\u2019m actually feeling a little bit confused on the conversation on your own spending on trade promotion because my understanding was that, your expectation for the year was that first half was heavier trade promotion activity until you had the innovation that you\u2019d planned to launch in the second half? So how did that not exactly play out? Was it that, it was just in terms of a first half second half story, did I misunderstand to begin to with but I thought really the plan was we\u2019ll promote to protect our shares until we have got new product activity?","Steve Robb","Laura, this is Steve. I think you are probably misunderstood. Our trade spending for the first half of the fiscal year is essentially flat on a year-on-year basis.","Don Knauss","As a percentage of sale.","Steve Robb","As a percentage of sales. And as we look to the second half of the fiscal year, the plans that we have put in place many months ago is to increase that to defend our market shares and to support the innovation. So there has been no change to the trade promotion plans. We\u2019re just continuing to echo the fact that trades promotion spending will be up in the second half as planned.","Don Knauss","","Yes.","","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital","Okay. And the final thing was just on pricing in Argentina, if you had heard any chat or anything around price control potentially becoming more onerous or coming into some of your categories or if that\u2019s not really been a source of worry just yet?","Don Knauss","We have had been under price controls for some time. We were able to get pricing through the second quarter which is certainly going to help the results. I think we\u2019ll have to see following this significant devaluation what the government does. They tend to tighten up a little bit on the price controls in the short-term has been our experience. But in Argentina, we have been able to take pricing just not as much as pricing as we would like to get and we\u2019ll have to see how it plays out over the next few quarters.","Steve Robb","Yes, the Government of Argentina has certainly more flexibility around pricing particularly behind innovation, so that\u2019s what why we were successful in October so I think that\u2019s what helped drive the results in the second quarter.","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital","Okay. And if the outlook and adjustment you\u2019ve made for Argentina, what\u2019s the assumption around your ability to price in the second half of the year?","Don Knauss","Essentially it assumes that the pricing that we have taken that we can carry into the second half of the year, we\u2019re hopeful to get more pricing but we\u2019re not counting on it right now.","Steve Robb","Yes, there\u2019s nothing, no incremental pricing baked into the plan for the back half Lauren.","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital","Okay great, thanks so much.","Don Knauss","Thank you.","Operator","And that concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Knauss I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to you.","Don Knauss","Well thank you everyone we know it was a, you had a lot going on today with the Church & Dwight Analyst Day as well so we appreciate the strong attendance and we look forward to talking to you on the next call. Thanks everyone.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation."],"5210":["The Clorox Co.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Mr. Steve Austenfeld, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Mr. Austenfeld, you maybe begin your conference.","Steven Austenfeld - The Clorox Co.","Great. Thank you. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining Clorox's Second Quarter Conference Call. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, Clorox's Chairman and CEO; and Steve Robb, our Chief Financial Officer. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com.","Let me remind you that on today's call we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures including but not limited to free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the financial results area of our website, as well as in our filings with the SEC. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release.","Please recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.","So with that said, we'll turn to our prepared remarks. I'll cover highlights of our second quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our financial results and outlook, and finally Benno will close with his perspective and then we'll open up the call for questions.","So let me start with volume and sales. As our second quarter sales reflect, the continued investments we've been making behind innovation and marketing are driving strong volume and sales growth. Starting with volume, we delivered our second consecutive quarter of 8% growth, our highest gain in nearly 10 years, and with increases, importantly, in each of our four segments.","Turning to sales, sales were up 5%, our highest growth in four years with increases in all of our U.S. segments. This sales growth reflects very strong volume on our base business in the U.S. in addition to price increases in certain international markets as well as about 2 points of growth from our acquisition last year of the Renew Life digestive health business. These factors were partially offset by continuing unfavorable foreign exchange rates.","Excluding slightly less than 2 points of negative foreign currency, total company sales were up 6% versus the year-ago quarter.","So simply put, we feel great about our top line results for the quarter and the first six months of the fiscal year. Our businesses are healthy and performing very well.","Now turning to market share, our 13 week share in U.S. tracked channels increased 1\/10th of a point versus the year-ago quarter with gains in four of our eight U.S. retail business units. This reflects our demand-building investments supporting recent innovation as well as our efforts to increase competitive activity in a number of categories, including Glad and Home Care.","From a category standpoint, tracked channel data reflected a decline of about 2\/10th of a point. However, our sales results in the quarter clearly indicate that tracked channel data does not capture the strong performance we're seeing in a number of untracked channels or businesses such as Home Care growth in the club channel, continued growth in our Professional Products business, strong results in the home hardware and pet specialty channels, growth with some untracked retailers that strongly support our Burt's Bees and Renew Life businesses and then finally, the momentum in online sales across our entire portfolio. Notably, there are some categories where e-commerce or online sales represent a top 10 or a top 5 channel with many of our businesses seeing very strong double-digit sales growth. So those are our results on a total company basis.","Let me now turn to our segment results. Starting with our Cleaning segment, second quarter volume increased 10% and sales grew 3% behind higher shipments of Home Care products and Professional Products, partially offset by lower shipments of Laundry products. Volume outpaced sales growth as we secured incremental distribution in the club channel and invested more heavily in trade promotion.","In Home Care, which is our largest U.S. business, sales increased high single digits. This gain was driven by disinfecting products, particularly Clorox disinfecting wipes and sprays, and all-time record shipments of Clorox toilet bowl cleaners as we continued to invest behind the total Clorox brand equity. Consistent with these results, Home Care delivered its 10th consecutive quarter of market share gains.","Looking to build on these results, we began shipping in December Clorox Scentiva, our new line of disinfecting sprays and wipes that also provides experiential fragrances. Initially we're offering two fragrances, Tuscan Lavender & Jasmine and Hawaiian Sunshine. While it's still very early, we are pleased with the initial results of these new products.","Moving on from Home Care, the Professional Products business delivered solid sales growth in the quarter. As in our Retail business, Clorox branded products are performing very well in the Professional Cleaning portion of the business. We're particularly excited about Clorox Fuzion, a new cleaner and disinfectant available to health care institutions which was launched in September. What makes Fuzion unique is that it kills microorganisms with minimal residue or odor, addressing a significant need in health care. Although Clorox Fuzion was just recently launched, it is running well ahead of expectations.","Turning to our Laundry business, sales decreased due to continuing softness in the sodium hypochlorite category. However, our focus remains on shifting consumption to higher-margin products such as Clorox Splash-Less Bleach, as well as investing behind our Clorox 2 color safe bleach.","Turning to our Household segment, we delivered 11% volume growth and 12% sales growth. These results reflect the benefit of the Renew Life digestive health business we acquired last May as well as higher sales in all of the other businesses in the segment: bags and wraps, charcoal and cat litter. So starting with bags and wraps, which is our Glad product line, we delivered sales growth driven by all-time record shipments of our premium OdorShield offerings, reflecting our focus on driving profitable growth in this higher-margin segment. And while market share in tracked channels for the bags and wraps category was down, due to a decrease in base trash bags, we continue to see growth in untracked channels with increases greater than 30% of Glad trash bags at some online retailers.","Turning to charcoal, top line results were up double-digits. That said, we also recognized Q2 as a relatively small quarter for this business. So charcoal's impact to total company results in the quarter wasn't as large as at other times of the year. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we are launching a new Kingsford Long-Burning Briquet, which will support the 2017 grilling season.","In cat litter, sales increased behind the Fresh Step with Febreze innovation we launched last calendar year. And while the category remains highly competitive, we did have our third consecutive quarter of market share growth for the Scoopable Fresh Step franchise.","And lastly, results in the Household segment also reflect the Renew Life acquisition, which represented about half of the segment sales growth in the quarter. Importantly, we remain very excited about this acquisition as we continue to gain new distribution, while driving share growth and we have a solid innovation pipeline planned for the second half of fiscal year 2017.","Turning to our Lifestyle segment, volume increased 5% and sales grew 4%. I'll start with our Burt's Bees business, in which sales grew mid-single-digits on top of a double-digit increase in the year-ago quarter. Supported this year by innovation across our lip and face lines, such as strawberry lip balm and cleansing oil and strong sell-in on new offerings including glossy crayons, tinted lip oil, Flavor Crystals lip balm and eye makeup remover pads. Burt's Bees second quarter market share reached an all-time high, reflecting the innovation I just noted as well as the strong core business.","Turning to our Food business, it also grew sales, driven by bottled Hidden Valley Ranch salad dressing and increased distribution of dry Hidden Valley products. Recent product innovations continue to perform well, including new flavors of our ranch with bottled salad dressing such as sriracha, cucumber, and cilantro lime, as well as our Hidden Valley Greek Yogurt dressing. Market shares continue to grow behind all segments of our bottled and dry dressings. And further, we have a strong pipeline of innovation planned for the second half of the fiscal year including the launch of a preservative-free offering called Simply Ranch (12:02).","Turning to our Brita water-filtration business, sales were about flat in the quarter, but looking ahead, we will continue to invest in marketing, PR and innovation. And on the innovation front, in Q3 we will launch Brita Stream a Filter As You Pour system, making filtering water in a Brita pitcher 10 times faster. We also introduced the Brita Longlast Filter, long last filter, which filters 120 gallons of water so it lasts three times longer than a traditional 40 gallon filter and reduces even more contaminants, including 99% of lead.","And then lastly, looking at our international business, volume increased 2% while sales decreased 2%. Excluding the 10-point impact we saw in the quarter from unfavorable foreign currency, sales grew 8%.","Looking forward, we remain encouraged by our ability to execute price increases in key markets as well as our investments in Renew Life, particularly in Canada, Burt's Bees in Asia, e-commerce and innovation in our Laundry business across Latin America and in the Middle East. In addition, our Go Lean strategy in international, which we've spoken to you about during the last year or so, is now yielding results as evidenced in the higher margins for the quarter. We're very pleased on our progress here as this will enable us to offset continued foreign currency headwinds as well as provide funds to continue investing in higher growth international businesses.","So to wrap up, we're very pleased with our top line performance for the second quarter and fiscal year-to-date. And based on our year-to-date performance, as well as our updated outlook for the second half of the fiscal year, we now anticipate full year sales growth in a range of 3% to 4% versus our previous outlook of 2% to 4%. Although foreign currency remains a headwind, fundamentally our brands are healthy. We continue to support them with higher marketing support and we have more innovation across the portfolio coming in the second half.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our Q2 performance and financial outlook.","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Hey, thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. Well, we're pleased to deliver another strong quarter of volume and sales growth, and I feel good that we're on track to deliver solid sales and earnings growth for the fiscal year.","Turning to our financial results for the second quarter, Q2 sales grew 5% reflecting 8 points of volume growth, including about 2 points from the Renew Life acquisition and more than a point of benefit from pricing in international. These factors were partially offset by slightly less than 2 points of negative foreign currencies and about 1 point from unfavorable mix.","Gross margin for the quarter increased 10 basis points on top of 210 basis points of growth in the year-ago quarter to 44.7% from 44.6% in the year-ago period, reflecting 140 basis points of cost savings and about 70 basis points of pricing in international. Our gross margin results also reflect 210 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs driven by ongoing inflationary pressures and strategic investments to support our brands and our cost savings pipeline. Importantly, we're pleased to see margin improvement in our international business as the team continues to gain traction behind our Go Lean productivity initiatives.","At 14% of sales, selling and administrative expenses were slightly lower than year-ago, reflecting ongoing productivity improvements. We continue to anticipate fiscal year selling and administrative expenses to come in below 14% of sales. Advertising and sales promotion spending was about equal to year-ago quarter, and importantly, our U.S. retail advertising spending came in at about 10% of sales, reflecting continued support behind our brands.","In the second quarter, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.14, flat versus the year-ago quarter. As we mentioned in our press release, this quarter's earnings results include a $21 million noncash charge related to the impairment of certain assets in the Aplicare Skin Antisepsis business, which reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.11. The charge was connected to an updated valuation of the Aplicare business based on proposed actions we plan to take in response to communications from the FDA in mid-December 2016. Excluding this noncash charge, second quarter earnings per shares were up strongly on top of the 18% growth in the year-ago quarter.","While we may have additional future charges, it's important to know that Aplicare represents slightly less than 1% of total company sales. It also only has $17 million in total assets remaining and is a small part of the Professional Products business. Given the evolving regulatory landscape for skin antisepsis products, we are exploring strategic alternatives for Aplicare. Still, this doesn't change the strategic direction of our Professional Products business, which is stopping the spread of infection on surfaces in health care settings. What matters most is the business continues to grow and is on track to deliver against our long-term aspirations.","Turning to cash flow, year-to-date net cash provided by continuing operations increased $93 million to $271 million, compared with $178 million in the year ago period. Free cash flow on a year-to-date basis, defined as net cash from continuing operations less capital expenditures, came in at $154 million compared to $110 million in the year ago period. For the full fiscal year, we continue to estimate free cash flow as a percentage of sales to be about 10%.","Turning to our fiscal year 2017 outlook, our fiscal year sales outlook is now in the range of 3% to 4% growth versus our previous range of 2% to 4%, recognizing our strong results of 4% sales growth in the first half of the fiscal year and an extensive innovation pipeline in the second half. Our updated sales outlook also now anticipates an impact of 1% to 2% from negative foreign currencies, which is somewhat less than previous expectations for the second half of the fiscal year. On a currency neutral basis, we expect sales growth to be in the range of 4% to 6%.","Turning to margin, we continue to anticipate gross margin to decrease slightly, reflecting continued inflationary pressures and firming commodity prices, partially offset by the benefit of cost savings. Over the long term, we continue to have confidence in our cost savings programs, including our Go Lean program in international, and that, combined with margin accretive innovation and some pricing, should enable us to build margin.","Advertising and sales promotion spending is expected to be about 10% of sales with much stronger investment in our third quarter, likely in the range of 11% to 12% of sales to support a number of new products in the second half of the fiscal year. We continue to anticipate our fiscal year EBIT margin expansion in the range of 25 to 50 basis points from lower selling and administrative expenses. In addition, we'll be lapping a number of items in the fourth quarter including integration costs related to the Renew Life acquisition and the mix effect from distribution expansion of Clorox disinfecting wipes in the club channel.","Turning to our fiscal year tax rate, we now anticipate a $0.05 to $0.10 benefit from adopting ASU 2016-09 versus our previous assumption of $0.10 to $0.15 of benefit. While we continue to anticipate our fiscal year tax rate to be between 32% and 33%, it will likely be at the upper end of this range. Net of all of these factors, we now anticipate fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of $5.23 to $5.38, or 6% to 9% growth versus fiscal year 2016.","Our diluted earnings per share range includes the non-cash charge and a lower anticipated tax benefit from the adoption of the accounting standards update. Importantly, our outlook also reflects the following anticipated benefits: stronger fiscal year sales growth with the expectation of continued top line momentum in the second half of the fiscal year behind our innovation programs, improving international margins, and an anticipated $11 million gain or $0.05 of additional EPS benefit from a real estate asset sale in the third quarter as our international team continues to right size infrastructure as a part of our Go Lean program.","And finally, I'm pleased to report the Renew Life business, which we acquired in May of 2016, is running ahead of our year one expectations. The integration has been going very well and we've been successful in gaining new distribution. As a result, we now anticipate its impact on fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share to be about flat, an improvement versus our previous assumption that it would be dilutive by $0.05 to $0.07.","In closing, we're pleased with our second quarter and fiscal year-to-date performance. Importantly, as I mentioned, we're on track to deliver solid sales and earnings growth in fiscal year 2017. As we look to the remainder of the fiscal year, we'll continue to focus on the following priorities. We'll stay the course in investing strongly behind our brands including some exciting innovation across our portfolio.","Next, long-term expansion remains a priority. We'll continue to invest behind productivity and cost savings programs, margin accretive innovation and take pricing actions when needed and we're certainly encouraged by our progress in international. Finally, I feel good about our ability to deliver long-term value to our shareholders. Our strategy is delivering strong results. We have leading brands that continue to deliver good value to our consumers. And our core business is healthy and we're seeing signs of improvement in international.","And with that, I will turn it over to Benno.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Thank you, Steve, and hello, everyone. It's great to be speaking with you at the halfway point of our fiscal year 2017. The most important thing I want to leave with you today is that our 2020 Strategy continues to work, which is evident in our Q2 results and performance for the fiscal year to date.","We had another quarter of very strong volume and sales growth with volume increases in all segments including international. Our marketing support continues to be strong, including significant support behind a number of meaningful product innovations during the first half of the fiscal year and more to come behind a strong innovation pipeline in the second half.","We had healthy gross margins on top of strong margin growth in the year-ago quarter despite inflationary pressures and substantial brand building investments. Excluding the $0.11 noncash asset impairment charge Steve outlined, earnings per share were up strongly on top of 18% growth in the year-ago quarter. We're very pleased with our financial performance for the quarter and for the first half of the fiscal year.","From a strategic standpoint, I'd like to highlight two areas, our focus on portfolio momentum and our focus on improving profitability in our international business. Starting with portfolio momentum. As a reminder, this is our strategy accelerator for making more differentiated investments in businesses that have a strong right (25:20) to accelerate growth with a focus on increasing household penetration for the total Clorox Company portfolio. And this focus is clearly working, as we are getting more of our products into consumers' homes than ever before. In fact, over three-fourths or 75% of our businesses have growing or stable household penetration and this is more than twice as many as when we started the 2020 Strategy three years ago.","This clearly speaks to the fundamental health of our core businesses and the effectiveness of our brand investments. Case in point, our gains in the e-commerce channel, supported by our investment in digital marketing and partnerships with e-commerce-related retailers. Many of our businesses, whether it's Burt's Bees or disinfecting wipes or Glad trash bags or Brita water filters are seeing strong double-digit growth in e-commerce and we're well on our way toward our goal of $300 million in profitable sales in this channel by fiscal year 2020.","Also, related to portfolio momentum, we certainly remain very excited about last May's acquisition of Renew Life in the fast-growing digestive health category. The business and all integration activities related to Renew Life are well on track and we're already seeing distribution gains with major retailers, much as we did when we acquired Burt's Bees.","Moving on to our international business. I'm very pleased by the work our international team has done to drive margin improvement. Our business outside of the U.S., similar to many other companies, has been challenged by foreign exchange devaluations and related cost inflation. As a result, we've been on a path to improve margins and drive profitable growth in international behind our Go Lean strategy. As evidenced by international's higher margins and strong increase in earnings for the quarter and despite continued near-term headwinds, we are cautiously optimistic that we'll continue to see profit growth in the balance of the fiscal year and over the long term. So overall, very strong performance for Q2 and the fiscal year to date.","Before opening it up for Q&A, let me return to my primary thought, which is that our 2020 Strategy is working and we're staying the course with our focus on profitable and sustainable growth. Three years into the strategy, we have made very good progress to date. After two years of very strong earnings per share growth, we are on track toward another very solid fiscal year with earnings per share growth in the mid to high single digits.","We will therefore continue to focus on executing against our strategy accelerators, increasing momentum in our portfolio with strong brand building investments, driving our innovation program and transforming how we engage with consumers in the digital arena. We'll also continue to enhance productivity and mine strong cost savings to fuel our investments and grow margins. As always, we will continue to focus on creating long-term shareholder returns.","So as we head into the second half of our fiscal year, we're especially pleased with the terrific work by our incredible team of employees around the world to create such strong and profitable growth in an environment where growth is so hard to come by.","And with that, let's open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Dorer. We'll pause for a moment. And we'll first hear from Jason English of Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Thank you for squeezing in the question. Congratulations on strong results this quarter. Not a lot of conversation around the competitive intensity that you've focused so much on the last couple of calls. So I was hoping you could update us in terms of what you're seeing out there in terms of the competitive environment. And then related to your margin trajectory, there was some concern that the investment, the re-inflation could cause some degradation. I see in your margin bridges that commodities or market movements on commodities remain a modest tailwind. If you could enlighten us in terms of what you're seeing there on the forward, I'd appreciate it. Thank you.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah, Jason, why don't I take the competitive question and Steve will answer your questions on margins. So competition really unchanged. Remains elevated, certainly in the three categories that we've mentioned in the past: disinfecting wipes, trash bags and cat litter. We think that it'll remain elevated near term as commodities are still somewhat lower and as there just remains a lot of activity in these categories.","Now, what's important, though, is that we're winning in all three categories. With wipes, we're seeing double-digit growth and certainly shares are very healthy. In trash bags, we're seeing a rise in sales, in particular in the premium segments, and the market share also in the premium segment of OdorShield products is up. And certainly litter now has become somewhat of a share growth engine for us behind the Fresh Step with Febreze innovation which is off to a great start. We're feeling good about where we are there.","So we like the performance in these three categories despite the continued heavy competitive activity. And importantly, we're driving the businesses in these three categories the right way. So while we're responding tactically on the trade promotion side to send the right signal, as a reminder, quite a bit of the trade promotion spend that we have in these three categories is going towards trial and speed to shelf on the innovations. So that's at the end of the day what our strategies are focused on, investing in brand equity building activities that have an eye on profitable and sustainable long-term growth and in investing in innovation. And we have really nice innovation in all categories in the back half.","Wipes, Steve Austenfeld talked about the Scentiva line, which is off to a good start with customers. On trash, we're launching a kitchen bag that we like. And on litter, we're doubling down on the innovation that we've launched last year with a new fragrance on Fresh Step with Febreze that we call Hawaiian Aloha. That's a fragrance that's done very well for us in Glad trash bags. And we have a new packaging innovation that is a trade up and a margin premium for us. So we feel good about the plans that we have in all three categories despite the fact that competition remains elevated. And with that, Steve is going to comment on margins.","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Yeah, thanks, Benno. So, Jason, on the margin, first let me just say that we're certainly pleased with the margin progress we saw in the second quarter. Our gross margin, of course, was up 10 bps on top of 210 bps in the year ago. And from an operational standpoint, I was very pleased with the operating margins in the quarter. And just looking forward, as I said in my opening comments, we do continue to anticipate even margin expansion for the full year of 25 to 50 bps. And there's a couple of reasons for that. One, cost savings continues to do very well for us. We feel like we've got very good plans in place to lower our selling and administrative costs as a percentage of sales, and I think you'll see that as we go through the year and it will driven by a combination of productivity and more normalized levels of incentive-based compensation.","And we're also, as a reminder, going to be lapping a number of one-time items in the fourth quarter year-ago, including the step-up costs on the Renew Life acquisitions. So for a large number of reasons I think we feel like we're very much on track to deliver a good expansion of margin. But I think what you'll see is a meaningful increase in EBIT margin in the fourth quarter and you'll also see us rebalancing our consumer demand-building investments between the third and the fourth quarter. And really, that's just to fully support our new products that we've recently launched and we think there's a great opportunity as they hit shelves to really get the advertising online and start leaning into that. So, overall, feel good about margins and things are unfolding about as we expected.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. I appreciate it. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, everyone.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Hey, Bonnie.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. I have a question on the sequential improvement in your price mix in the Household segment in the quarter. What drove that? I guess, it doesn't appear there was really a lot of pricing taken in the quarter, so was this driven more by a pull-back in your promo activity, possibly in trash bags?","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Yeah, I think, well, from a pricing standpoint, overall, I would say most of this is really being driven by premium innovation. If you look at the Glad business, we continue to see margin improvements over the long term really being driven by a shift to the premium side of that business. And I think also I would point out in the quarter as you look at the segments, our international business had a really nice step-up in margins behind our Go Lean business. So overall, it's the things we've talked about that are driving margins plus some nice improvements in a couple of these segments tied to innovation, our Go Lean programs and other actions that we're taking.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for that. And I just had a couple of quick questions on Renew Life. Benno, you mentioned you've expanded distribution for Renew Life, but could you provide a little more color on that and where you're at with this opportunity? And then separately, we've seen a lot of media and advertisement surrounding probiotics. So I guess I'm curious to hear how you guys perceive the competitive environment in this category right now and whether it's becoming more or less competitive. Thank you.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah, thanks, Bonnie. So as we said, Renew Life is ahead of expectations for the fiscal year. That's to, not just for earnings per share, which we've mentioned earlier but also in terms of sales and margins. The integration certainly is well on track and like you commented on, we're getting distribution wins with major retailers and we expect that to continue. And that was our hypothesis when we bought this business that, this would be such a good fit with our capabilities in so many ways starting with distribution.","And just to name a few in food, we got distribution wins with Albertsons-Safeway, a major food retailer. In drug we're seeing distribution expansion with Rite Aid. And in Mass, we're seeing major wins with Walmart. So it's really across the board. Which tells us that our capabilities are very relevant in this area. And we'll begin supporting these wins with a brand new marketing campaign later in the fiscal year that we're excited about and we're starting to ramp up innovations in the fiscal year back half and certainly expect more to come. So we feel good about the acquisition and it's an example of how we want to operate. We want to keep the core of the business healthy while putting our cash to work if the right opportunity comes along.","So the category, of course, commenting on your competitive remark, continues to be growing very nicely and it's a very fragmented category still at this point. So we think that this is going to continue, but the tide is certainly increasing, so right now I look at competition in this category and at advertising in this category as a real positive thing, because awareness and trial behind these categories in the grand scheme of things compared to be some of the other categories that we're in is really low.","So this is a good thing and hopefully, obviously also we expect that as we think about the competitive environment, at some points, probably not in the next few years, but at some point there will be more consolidation in this category because it's very fragmented. And our hypothesis is, as we typically do well in other categories, that once this consolidation happens that our company and our brand is going to be a winner. But at this point, competition is good because it raises awareness and trial and at some point, it will be more cannibalistic and there will be winners and losers and we'll do our part so we can be winners.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Olivia Tong of Bank of America.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. On gross margin, the mix has been fairly negative for a few quarters but you didn't call it out this quarter. And obviously, we know about wipes but what was the impact of mix overall to gross margins? And are there any other big movers in addition to wipes?","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. Well, when you look at the \u2013 and if you go out our web attachments, you'll see that the all other category, which does include mix, was actually, was nice. It was about flat this quarter. I guess the two things that are worth calling out, first is the incremental distribution of disinfecting wipes at Costco. It's a great piece of business. We're very happy to have it. But there is a bit of a negative drag on that. We'll be anniversary-ing that as we go into the fourth quarter. So that's in the number. But it's being offset by business mix. We were just saying some of our higher margin businesses were growing a bit better in the quarter and as a result it kind of washed that out. I think you're going to see variability in that line item of gross margin as we move through the quarters. But on balance, we certainly feel good about the results for Q2.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks. And I don't how frequently you measure this but is your availability at Costco and wipes helping to build trial and consumption in anyway?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. The best way, Olivia, we love to look at this as household penetration. And household penetration over the last year on this business is up almost 20%. So I'd would look at that as a clear signal that, as anticipated, what the club distribution improvement has done is expand the reach of this category. And I'll remind everybody that the total wipes category household penetration is still only at about 50% and the way we look at this is that there's plenty of room to grow. So even though as Steve mentioned, it's a little bit of a negative mix hit that will cycle through in Q4. This is a very good thing for us in the long term and it helps increase the reach in a category that's hot and that we expect to continue to do well even as we will anniversary the distribution win at Costco.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks. And then just two last questions. First, the Household business, while the mix got better, the margins or the profit margins on that came down, so can you talk about what's driving that? And then also, you mentioned certain businesses have a bigger online presence than others. I imagine Burt's is one of them, perhaps Brita, but probably less so for Kingsford and bleach, but maybe could you give a little bit more color in terms of which of the businesses have the bigger online presence? Thank you.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah, maybe I'll start there and then Steve can comment on margins. So as you'd expect, so while we don't necessarily comment on all businesses and the presence online, but businesses that skew younger and businesses that from a logistics point of view are a little advantaged like disinfecting wipes, Brita, Burt's Bees, also Renew Life, they're doing very well.","But also businesses that have somewhat of a regular purchase pattern like Glad trash bags, as Steve Austenfeld commented on earlier on have done extremely well. So we're seeing strength on this business across the board with businesses that skew younger, like Burt's Bees and Brita, perhaps leading the way as a nice little sound bite on this. Amazon.com on Brita is now our number four customer. So it tells you that that's a business that's doing particularly well and perhaps where the performance in tracked channels that you all are following is not telling the whole story of how that business is really doing. And then, Steve, can perhaps take your point on margins in Household.","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Just turning to the Household segment, I would say actually broadly defined by the way, we saw some nice more margin expansion in a couple of our businesses, including charcoal and litter. The one business I would point to is our Glad business. Now, again, we feel great about the strategy to trade consumers up to the more premium segment, which as a reminder is margin accretive to the company. But the margins were down in the Glad business. Part of this is just a reflection of the firming up of commodity cost, but I think the larger component is really the competitive activity that we've talked about for some time in that category and the step up in investment. So I would say overall the business is healthy. Our strategy to drive premiumization in the category is working but there's a lot of competitive intensity and spending around that and that's really what impacted margins this quarter.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Hey, Bill.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. The first question I have is if you look at the manufacturing and logistics line on that gross margin bridge, it looks like there's been like 700 basis points of aggregate compression since 2012. So can you just explain what that really is and maybe if there's anything you can do different, like automation or factory closures or something to reverse that level of decline? And then I have a follow-up please.","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","That's a good question, Bill. Really what you're looking at over the very long-term is inflationary pressures. Keep in mind, we operate in many countries around the world that are experiencing much higher rates of inflation than the U.S. So what you're looking at is a combination of U.S. domestic inflation as well as international inflation. I think that's the largest part of it. Now more recently, you've seen that number increase beyond the historical trend and that's because we've made some choices to make incremental investments to support our cost savings programs, to support margin accretive innovation, to support capacity expansion behind some of our faster growing businesses.","I think as you look into the next couple of quarters, at least our plans call for that number to come down a bit but, to be clear, the inflation will continue. And I think the best way to get after that is to keep doing what we're doing, which is drive the cost savings, tightly control our selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales, take pricing where it makes sense and where it's cost justified. And as we've said for some time, if we can control the controllables, I think over the long term we'll do well on margins.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then the follow up, the $0.11 impairment charge which is embedded in the guidance, it looks like the broad strokes on the guidance, except for the stock-based comp change, is pretty much the same. So I'm trying to figure out how you're making up for that shortfall in the back half unless you already always knew that the impairment charges come in this quarter? And then unrelated follow-up, can you just tell us what percent of sales are e-commerce now and how fast they're growing in aggregate?","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Yeah, let me start with your first question. And let's be clear, we did not know about the impairment charge. As I had mentioned in my opening comments, this is related to some communication activity that occurred in mid-December. Okay? And in terms of how we're offsetting this, again, something I opened up in my comments, there's three things I would point you to. The first is just the strength of our base business. I'm very pleased that we've grown 4% in incremental sales growth in the first six months of the year. That's actually about 6% on a currency neutral basis. Our Renew Life acquisition that Benno commented on is actually doing quite well. And while it's early days, we're running ahead of our first-year expectations and that's certainly going to help.","And then finally as a part of our international Go Lean efforts, not only are we starting to get traction on our margins but, as you know, we want to not just improve margins on that business but we want to drive economic profit. And one of the best ways to do that is to take a hard look at your asset base and make sure you're the highest value owner. And so as a part of that in the third quarter I'm pleased that we're selling some real estate. And not only will that generate some nice cash flows for our shareholders, Bill, but that will also throw off a one-time gain of about $0.05. So those are three things that I would point out that are a bit different than our previous outlook. And overall, I think we feel pretty good about the performance of the quarter and the year.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","And then, Bill, I think you asked about e-commerce. It's now north of 3% of total company sales and it's growing at a 30% clip. So well on track.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Edge Research.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thanks very much. Just a couple of questions. When I think about volume clearly coming in, you talked about price mix being pretty nice, at least sequentially, and volume coming in which clearly has to be maybe somewhat better than expectations. I'm trying to understand why maybe there's not a little bit more natural lift to the gross margin line. I get reinvestment at the SG&A line. So it'd be my first question, like what are the big pieces for that across the company? Because you said price mix was positive.","And then secondly, I was kind of blown away to see charcoal as a callout in December. A pleasant surprise here in front of the Super Bowl where I'm going to be smoking some meat. Can you frame the relative size of that business typically in Q2? And I know you called out some distribution gains, but is there something else trend-wise going on there? People buying, smokers getting trendy or something like that that could maybe create a permanent bigger base for that business going forward. Thanks.","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Yeah, well, let me clarify my comments on charcoal. It was up nicely in the quarter, but it's off-season, okay? So it helped with the margins within the segment, I think that was the question, but I don't want to overemphasize the impact that charcoal was having on the quarter.","As it relates to the margin drivers, obviously, we're feeling very good about the volume growth. Of course, included in that volume growth we do have our disinfecting wipes distribution at Costco which generates more volume than sales just because it's a lower price point, but it's still a very attractive business. Renew Life is also included in that. But I would again just reference you to the web attachments where I think we do a very nice job of really detailing out all the puts and takes on margins.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","And then, Jonathan, longer term on charcoal, yeah, there are tailwinds and we're taking advantage of them. One thing we're seeing is that millennials are getting into grilling and they love charcoal. So right now the sale of charcoal grills is actually up. So remember about five years ago charcoal grilling was supposed to be dead and it was all going to be about gas grilling and that trend pretty much has reversed. So we think that creates a natural tailwind. People love grilling. Increasingly, people love grilling year-round.","You mentioned Super Bowl and there's certainly certain states around the country where weather-wise charcoal grilling is very feasible year-round and we're taking advantage of that trend. For instance, with partnerships that we have with the NFL and ESPN, but also other things that we're doing with retailers to encourage impulse purchases pretty much year-round. Even though, as Steve said, Q2 is a smaller quarter, but as we now start to get into the season again in the spring, we certainly feel good about the plans that we have in place with retailers to continue to leverage that tailwind that we have in the category.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Just a few things. One is, if you go in and exclude the impact of the better-than-expected Renew Life and then the expansion of wipes in Costco, is it fair to now say that the underlying organic sales growth was something like 3%? Almost 3% I guess is the math that I get to, not quite. And how does that work longer term in the context of your 3% to 5% organic sales growth target, given everything you're investing in right now?","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Well, Ali, for perspective, let me take the first part of that. Renew Life contributed about 2 points to growth for the company in the second quarter, so if that helps you do the math. I would just say longer term we continue to feel good about the 3% to 5% top-line sales growth. The biggest challenge, as you well know, over the last year or two has been currency headwinds. Now, we do anticipate those are going to be maybe a bit less than what we've been seeing. Time will tell. And if that's the case then I think you should see the sales growth for the company, as long as we continue to deliver good momentum, which we believe we can, I think we can be solidly in the 3% to 5% over the long term.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. I was talking about organic sales and you have to add the 1% back roughly from the wipes to get you to the 3%, but I get where you're coming from. On margins, so the 25 to 50 basis points EBIT guidance, I get the $21 million Aplicare. I get the somewhat of a reversal from the international sale of real estate. Renew Life getting a little bit better. But it still feels like there's a hole to plug, especially if the A&P is going to be flat between R&D and SG&A. And you mentioned a couple times even a couple of quarters ago that's where the back half of the year, we would see the SG&A come down significantly. It feels like it's going to be very significant. So I want to get a sense from you how much you expect SG&A, R&D together to come down in basis points roughly in the back half of the year.","And you guys have always been very, very thoughtful in terms of your benchmarking. Can you give us a sense of where you think an endpoint might be longer term for at least the SG&A part of that?","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. So you have a lot in there. Let me try this, Ali. Starting with the S&A. As we have said I think for some time, we anticipate getting that below 14% for the full year. I think we're making good progress against that. As you look at the latter part of this fiscal year, particularly the fourth quarter, we've got two things, as I mentioned earlier, that are going to work for us. First is just ongoing cost savings and productivity and then the second is going to be more normalized levels of incentive-based compensation which were elevated last year because we had a fabulous year. And I think everybody felt very good about those numbers.","So those are the reasons we believe SG&A is likely to continue to come down. For absolute clarity, the other things that I would point to particularly in the second half is, again, about a $0.05 gain associated with the sale of some real estate in international. And, again, Renew Life, this is a full year number but it had been anticipated to be $0.05 to $0.07 diluted. We now think it's about flat, call that about a $0.06 change. So those are the big drivers that I would call out.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. So you've made that clear. I'm just suggesting that SG&A is going to have to come down a lot more. Okay. Then last thing is on international, clearly margins got better there, the business got better quite a bit. Can you just describe the actual actions, besides the real estate sale, which I understand the impact on EPS, what kind of changes are you making in that business just on an operational execution level? As detailed as you can get. Thank you.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah, thanks, Ali. We're really encouraged by the progress in international, profit up 27% in Q2. Specifically, I would say we have talked about the bottom line actions for a while and we dubbed that Go Lean and the specific actions we're taking on pricing, making our operations leaner, and the Australia real estate sale is just an example of that. Making sure that we only spend against activities that deliver return. Employing our strong cost savings machine that you are very aware of from the U.S. also against international. And we're seeing that now really shine through.","But also on the top line, I would say there are things that we're doing that are clearly helping. One is where the pricing that I described also leads to sales growth. Renew Life is working very well, in particular, in Canada. It's a very meaningful and profitable, mind you, contributor and has done extremely well since the acquisition. Investing in higher-margin future opportunities like Burt's Bees Asia, as I'm talking about shifting mix and shifting investments towards profitable items. We're feeling very good about the progress that we're making in Burt's Bees. And then Laundry certainly is quite a profitable business in international and we have innovation that we're driving in the Middle East and in Latin America that's quite successful.","So that may serve as a few examples of specific activities that lead us to be in an environment that is certainly going to continue to be volatile and full of headwinds near-term. We're quite optimistic that Q2 will be perhaps the start of somewhat of a turnaround in international and that we'll see profit growth for the rest of the fiscal year and going forward. And as we've also commented on in the past, we're optimistic about this business in the long-term as Argentina, hopefully, will continue to do better as the government has taken all the right actions and that headwind turns more into hopefully a tailwind and importantly the strength of our brands and the operations that we have in international.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Glad to see that start turning. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Altobello of Raymond James.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks. Just want to go back to gross margin for a second. Obviously, a nice sequential improvement quarter-over-quarter. You did call out mix earlier as one component of that, but trade promo was included, obviously, in that other line. It was up pretty significantly last quarter. So curious what happened this quarter in terms of overall trade spend? It seems like it decelerated a little bit.","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Yeah, that's a good question. You know, I would say, as we had planned, we stepped up the level of our trade spending in the quarter to support our brands. So trade spending was up versus a year ago in the quarter and again, that was per plan. And I think what you'll continue to see us do is invest heavily to get the trial and repeat on our innovation. So I think you'll see that trend continue into the third quarter as well as a step up in our advertising in the third quarter, in particular. And some of that will come out of the fourth quarter. We're just rebalancing the quarters.","Steven Austenfeld - The Clorox Co.","I think, Joe, this is Steve Austenfeld, just building on Steve's comments. I would point to two things in that all other line that helped not be as dilutive as has been in recent quarters. One is that foreign currency wasn't as bad on a year-over-year basis as it had been previously, so that helped. And then secondly, the mix effect, which I think Steve talked about in response to an earlier question. Whereas we're still seeing some product mix related to some club volumes as we've discussed. We did have much more favorable business unit mix, mix across the franchise that helped us out there.","And since you're looking at this gross margin reconciliation page and I appreciate you doing so and we've gotten a lot of questions on this. If you just fast-forward for a quarter or two and compare versus the second quarter, I think big picture \u2013 and there's always going to be movements across these different drivers, but for market movement, our prediction is it's going to start to be a little bit more dilutive, as we've said. We think commodities are probably going to rise after having certainly been a tailwind over the last year or so. But alternately, the manufacturing logistics line we think will become a bit more favorable. So gross margin may still be challenged for a little bit in Q3. Q4 may look a bit better, but that's the way I'd look at this table in terms of the major drivers on this, in terms of what may change going forward.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Steve. And just one second one. In terms of the bleach category it sounds like obviously still a struggle there. One, did your shares hold up this quarter and two, what's the strategy to reaccelerate that category?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Look, if we look at sodium hypochlorite bleach, which is I think what you're referring to, Joe, our strategy has always been to trade up to the more profitable items and that continues to do well. Splash-Less is a very profitable and a higher dollar-ing, a category that's doing well and will continue to drive that.","And then, when we talk about bleach, though, I'd encourage us all to continue to think about bleach also as a broader category. That includes bleach-based sprays. That includes toilet bowl cleaners. Those show up in Home Care. But if you look at those, those are all growing and in part we have record highs in some of those categories and we've had record highs for several quarters in a row. So I would argue that perhaps all the trade-up efforts that lead to higher sales and higher profits in bleach aren't fully reflected in the Laundry category progress, but that if you look at total Laundry and Home Care together, the bleach category is actually doing very well and our strategy in that is working.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson of Citi Research.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Just a couple of things. First of all, was the pipeline sale of Scentiva material at all in the quarter? Is that something we have to think about as we sequence second quarter going into third quarter? And then also on wipes, it sounds like you're going into a category which is awesome, but can you remind us when you went into Costco, did you replace another branded player or did they simply add to the category? Because I'm wondering if, as you come up on anniversary-ing that distribution, I know Costco is sometimes in and out with various brands, is there any risk to you losing any distribution there?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","So to your first question, Wendy, Scentiva pipeline volume in Q2, the answer is no. So not significant. On wipes, this was a permanent replacement of the number two player in the category. There's always risk of distribution gains and losses in club, right, but in general we've done well and we don't expect to lose that business again because the business is doing very well in Costco and elsewhere.","And as a reminder, the business, while we expanded distribution in club, also continued to do very well in food, drug, mass. In fact, the business for the most part was up double digits in food, drug, mass as we expanded distribution in club. And that just tells you that fundamentally the programs that we have to increase household penetration with strong marketing, with innovation and certainly with a little bit of trade promotion to counter the competitive activity as they lost distribution in club, is working very well and we continue to be optimistic about the prospects in wipes.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And in the context of wipes but also in a couple of other businesses where you've talked about unfavorable mix, I know there are a lot of moving pieces. But calling it out, hey this is the strongest volume growth we've seen in a really long time, it's also a couple of quarters where you're seeing more negative price mix than we have in a long time. And I just want to understand if you think there's been a change in the cost of doing business, or as we go into fiscal 2018, do you think we'll be looking at a scenario where overall price mix returns to being positive?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah, it should normalize, Wendy. Certainly, again, wipes in Costco, that's a significant driver. If you look at volume versus sales, or net sales ratio across the segments, you can certainly see that the spread between volume and sales is most explicit in cleaning, and I would point to wipes as a significant driver there. And as Steve mentioned earlier, we're going to cycle through that in Q4 so that for fiscal year 2018, that mix headwind will go away.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. Terrific. Thank you so much.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Steve Powers of UBS.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Hey. Thanks. Just a few cleanups, if I could. First, back on the SG&A in the back half question, just to clarify, given the productivity and the normalization of performance-based incentive comp that you mentioned, is it fair to think about that line running kind of flat Q3 versus Q4 in dollar terms? Or do you still expect Q4 to remain notably elevated versus Q3?","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","I'm not going to get into that fine detail, but what I can tell you is this, is we fully expect that our selling and administrative expenses are going to be down on the year. Now you can go look at the first half fiscal year-to-date, look at the math, and then kind of run it. We typically true up some of those accruals in the fourth quarter so you might have more benefit in the fourth quarter than the third quarter, but, nonetheless, I think you're going to see those numbers in the second half, in total, come down year over year and that'll be a nice contributor to EBIT margin and should get the S&A line down below 14% of sales. That's certainly what the plan calls for and what we're executing against.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Fair enough. And then you may have mentioned it but could you offer how much you returned to shareholders through repurchases this quarter? Any expectations going forward for further buybacks that may be in the second half outlook?","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","I think as we've said for some time, we'll periodically go into the market to offset dilution. We did a little bit this quarter. There wasn't a lot because, quite frankly, we're not seeing much option-exercise activity over the last quarters so there just hasn't been as much dilution to offset. I think on a go-forward basis, if you look at the company today, our debt to EBITDA on a gross basis is sitting at about a 2.1. So we're at the low end of the range. And as I mentioned in my opening comments, we're throwing off a lot of cash so I think over the next year or two, it's likely if we start to build up excess cash in partnership with the board, we'll have to look at either additional inorganic growth opportunities which we'll continue to look for, obviously, or some way of returning money back to our shareholders. But what we will try to avoid because it's not good for our shareholders or economic profit is building up cash that we just don't need.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then lastly, just on the wipes discussion a moment ago, as you lap the Costco win and as you lap, as you said, a lot of activity in the category across all channels looking back over the last three quarters or so, what's the outlook for that category and for your business, again, as you're cycling all this?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah, Steve, so like I said earlier, we expect this category to continue to grow and we expect our brands to continue to lead to sales growth in the category. So there are some things that we're lapping. Certainly, the Costco distribution win is one, but I will remind everybody that sales also in food, drug, mass and certainly in other non-tracked channels is up quite nicely. And I think you've heard us talk about Scentiva as the latest innovation that's been received by customers very favorably to date. We'll continue to support the business with innovation. We'll continue to support the business with strong marketing programs. And this is a business that continues to have a tailwind.","Like I said earlier, household penetration in the total category hovers right at around 50%, and we look at that as glass half-empty and think we have a lot more to go given that household penetration in several of the other Home Care categories is significantly higher. And the reality is that the wipes product form is beginning to be the most preferred product form by consumers, and we're leveraging that tailwind. So expecting continued solid growth in the category even post Q4.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good afternoon. I was hoping you guys could talk a little bit about Brita. I thought the conversation around coming innovation, particularly in filters was really interesting. So, one, is this the first time that you've had this sort of magnitude of innovation of news and so on, on the filters? Two, do the filters fit in existing pitcher? Does it come with a pitcher kind of trade out dynamic? And then three, are they generally at a price premium to what's in the market today? Thanks.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah, Lauren, if you think back about the conversations that we've had with you and investors over the last year or two, we've always said that on the two businesses where we think we can do better, litter and Brita, we want to turn those around, but we want to do it the right way, meaning profitably and in ways that are sustainable. And certainly, in litter, we've done exactly that and we've also said that in Brita it would take time until we have innovation, and that time is now.","So we'll invest in the back half quite significantly behind strong innovation plan, which has two components. First of all, what we call Brita Stream pitchers, which by the way, has Stephen Curry on packaging, which pops at shelf really nicely. And these pitchers address a barrier in the category and that's convenience. So you can filter as you pour and it makes the filter experience much faster. You can filter water about 10 times as fast as with traditional filters in the category. So great design, very contemporary and upbeat and filter as you pour. So I feel good about that.","And then second, as you mentioned, Longlast filter, they last 3 times as long and are going to specifically target those consumers who aren't replacing their filters as consistently perhaps as we would like them to. The filter also removes lead, 99%, so we can make that claim, and it's a much better value compared to a branded and also on a relative term private label filters in the marketplace. So that, of course, addresses value as something that has held us back in share a little bit over the last few years in the category. And we expect that the two innovations together in addressing the two major opportunities in convenience and value should do quite well on top. We have a new ad campaign, again, featuring Stephen Curry, the NBA's MVP, that was very well received in premarket testing and that will go out into spring.","So as a result, clearly we want this business to do better. It is doing much better in non-tracked channels than it is in tracked channels but we're feeling positive about the plans based on innovations both product as well as in other areas and the support that we get from retailers behind those.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. And, sorry, the new filter, sorry, the long-lasting filter, the one that removes lead, does that also fit in the new pitchers?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. I missed out on that. It does not fit with the Stream pitchers. That's a separate filter, but it does fit with all the other pitchers that we sell.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Cool. Thank you so much.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Thanks, Laura.","Steven Austenfeld - The Clorox Co.","Why don't we take a question from one last caller?","Operator","And actually this concludes the question and answer session. Mr. Dorer, I would like to turn the program back over to you.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah, thank you. In closing, we're very pleased with our results for Q2 and the fiscal year-to-date. And that, of course, reflects continued investments in support of our 2020 Strategy. Our strategy is working and we're staying the course with our focus on accelerating profitable and sustainable growth. So thanks again for joining us today, and we'll see you all at CAGNY.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded. And I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Mr. Steve Austenfeld, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Mr. Austenfeld, you may begin your conference","Steven Austenfeld - Vice President-Investor Relations","Great. Thank you. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining Clorox's second quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, Clorox's CEO; and Steve Robb, our Chief Financial Officer. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com.","Let me remind you that, on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA, and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations.","Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures, determined in accordance with GAAP, can be found in today's press release, this webcast, prepared remarks, or supplemental information available in the Financial Results area of our website, as well as in our filings with the SEC. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release.","Please recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements.

Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.","So turning to our prepared remarks, I'll cover highlights on our second quarter business performance by segment, Steve Robb will then address our financial results and outlook for fiscal year 2016, and, finally, Benno will close with his perspective as well as open up the call for Q&A.","So turning to our top line results, in the second quarter, volume grew 1% and sales were flat as the benefits of pricing and volume growth were offset by unfavorable foreign exchange and increased trade spending. On a currency-neutral basis, sales grew 3% and that was on top of 6% in the year-ago quarter. Each of our U.S. business segments grew sales in the quarter as did our International business on a currency-neutral basis.","Market share in the U.S. during the quarter increased 0.1 point versus the year-ago period, up to 22.3%. We're pleased to see that our investments in higher-margin, faster-growing businesses are continuing to support stable to growing market shares in our categories. We're also pleased that International shares grew meaningfully for the six-month period ending in November, which is the latest available reporting period.","Looking at our categories, five of our eight U.S. retail business units increased market share, with particularly strong gains in Home Care and Charcoal. In addition to improving market shares, driving category growth remains a top priority. And, during the quarter, our U.S. categories were up a very healthy 2 points. As this quarter's performance highlights, the investments we're making behind innovation and strong marketing communications to drive profitable growth are working.","And with that, I'll review our second quarter results by segment. Starting with our Cleaning segment, second quarter volume and sales each increased 2%, largely due to higher shipments of Home Care products.","Within Home Care, which is our largest U.S. business unit, sales increased strongly, with growth seen broadly across Clorox-branded products. In particular, we saw double-digit growth on Clorox disinfecting wipes and that's despite a fairly muted cold and flu season to-date.","Building on our cleaning in-the-flow growth platform, we began shipping three new Clorox ScrubSingles items in December, Heavy Duty, Decide-A-Size, and Multi-Purpose. These items build on previously-launched new products such as Clorox disinfecting wipes with Micro Scrubbers which have done particularly well in market.","Sales in our Laundry business also increased in the quarter, driven in part by our most recent price increase on Clorox bleach, which was a year ago in February of 2015. From a market share standpoint, while overall bleach share dipped in the quarter, we were very pleased to see strong share growth on our Splash-Less product line. Splash-Less Bleach is a trade up from our regular product and we're driving growth with new sizes and dedicated advertising. Consistent with our strategy, this is a great example of a margin accretive product helping to drive profitable growth.","Partially offsetting the increased sales in Home Care and Laundry was a decline in sales from our Professional Products business which was comparing against very strong double-digit growth in the year-ago quarter, which had been driven by last year's Ebola and Enterovirus concerns. Looking forward to the remainder of fiscal year 2016, we continue to expect our Professional Products business to grow sales strongly.","Switching to the Household segment, we delivered flat volume and 1% sales growth. In Bags & Wraps, sales were flat as we lapped a price increase taken in November of 2014, and also increased trade promotion spending.","Consistent with our strategy to accelerate profitable growth, the Glad business is driving category trade up from our base trash bags to our higher-margin premium trash bag business, represented by our ForceFlex and OdorShield offerings. In September, we began shipping to key retailers new kitchen trash bags branded as Glad with Clorox. These bags feature antimicrobial properties that help control the growth of bacterial odors. We expect this new item to successfully build on prior launches of Glad OdorShield bags with the Power of Febreze and we're also launching two new scents in this line in the third quarter to continue bringing news to the premium trash bag category.","Turning to Charcoal, and keeping in mind that Q2 is a relatively small quarter for this business, we were pleased to see that sales grew strongly in the quarter behind consumption and distribution gains. Also at the tail end of the quarter we began shipping new products for the upcoming season, including Easy Light bag, new Charcoal offerings with hickory and applewood and a new competition briquet.","Turning to Cat Litter, in the second quarter, sales declined in comparison to the year-ago quarter, which benefited from the launch of Fresh Step Lightweight Extreme Cat Litter. In December, we began shipping Fresh Step with the Power of Febreze across multiple formats and in all sizes, and the product is starting to appear on shelf and advertising starts in a few days.","Turning to our Lifestyle segment, sales grew 2%, with double-digit gains in Natural Personal Care and solid gains in food partially offset by a decline in Water Filtration sales. Sales in our food business grew solidly behind our Ranch with bottled salad dressing such as Ranch with Sweet Chili and Ranch with Roasted Garlic as well as our dry Hidden Valley dressing and dip mixes, such as Greek Yogurt.","Turning to our Brita Water Filtration business, sales declined following a very strong first quarter. Our focus on Brita is to drive trial, and in mid-December we announced a new demand-creation strategy centering on a partnership between Brita and Stephen Curry, the National Basketball Association's Most Valuable Player. The initial announcement was broadly covered across social media and Stephen Curry will be featured in national television ads beginning in March as well as through digital, public relations, and social media campaigns.","On our Burt's Bees business sales grew double-digits, largely due to the launch of new lipsticks, blemish balm cream, also known as BB cream, and new Mint Cocoa and Caramel Apple lip balms. In addition, facial towelettes continued to perform strongly, and we enjoyed particularly strong consumption behind our holiday program this year. This quarter's results reflect the health of the Burt's Bees business as the quarter's double-digit gain comes on top of double-digit sales increases in the year-ago quarter.","And lastly in International, sales declined 7% reflecting unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates essentially across all markets. However, on a currency-neutral basis, sales for International grew a solid 6%. As we look ahead to the second half of the fiscal year, and the possibility that foreign currency headwinds may worsen, we're very pleased that our Go Lean strategy in International is working, and it enabled us to maintain margins as we focus on price maximization, cost savings, right-sizing our infrastructure, and optimizing demand creation. Over time, we remain committed to improving our International margins.","So to wrap up, we're very pleased with our top line performance for the first half of the fiscal year, which is on track with our expectations.","And with that, I'll now turn over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our second quarter performance and updated outlook for fiscal year 2016.","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well thanks, Steve, and welcome everyone. Well, we're very pleased with our second quarter performance. We grew sales in our U.S. segments and in the International segment on a currency-neutral basis. Importantly, we continued to expand our margins by driving productivity and cost savings programs across all of our businesses, delivering our highest second quarter gross margin in five years, which helped mitigate the impact of double-digit foreign currency declines in most countries. We're also pleased to raise our fiscal year EPS outlook, which I'll talk about in a moment.","First, I'll turn to our financial results for the quarter. In the second quarter, sales were flat with volume and pricing contributing a combined impact of about three points, offset by nearly three points of unfavorable foreign exchange rates and nearly a point of higher trade promotion spending. Gross margin for the quarter increased 210 basis points to 44.6%, reflecting 180 basis points from favorable commodities, primarily from resin and diesel, 130 basis points of cost savings and 110 basis points of pricing benefit. These factors were partially offset by about 150 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs.","Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of sales was essentially flat versus year-ago at about 14.2% of sales. Advertising and sales promotion investment for the quarter was more than 9% of sales, essentially flat compared to the year-ago quarter. Importantly, our investments in our U.S. retail business remained healthy at more than 10% of sales. In addition, we continued to increase total demand-building investments to support our brands. Now, net of all these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.14, an 18% increase versus the year-ago quarter, reflecting strong gross margin expansion.","Fiscal year-to-date free cash flow was $110 million compared with $207 million in the year-ago period, reflecting higher employee incentive compensation payments from the company's strong fiscal year 2015 performance and higher tax payments. These factors were partially offset by higher earnings from continuing operations. Notably, we continue to anticipate free cash flow for the fiscal year to be about 10% of sales.","Now, we'll turn to our fiscal year 2016 outlook. We continue to anticipate sales growth of flat to up 1% based on solid first half sales growth, followed by flat sales in the second half of the fiscal year, reflecting strong volume growth offset by foreign currency declines and higher trade promotion investment. Our full year sales outlook reflects stronger growth in the U.S. as we continue to lean into our strategy to invest incrementally in our domestic brands.","We anticipate the strength in our U.S. businesses to be offset by lower sales in International, due to increasingly unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, including the recent significant devaluation in Argentina. On a currency-neutral basis, we continue to anticipate sales growth of 3% to 4%. Our full year sales outlook also continues to anticipate about three points of incremental sales growth from product innovation, continued slowing international economies, and about three points of negative impact from foreign currency declines and heightened competitive activity in the second half of the fiscal year from competitors stepping up in-store promotion in key categories.","We now expect EBIT margin to increase in the range of 50 basis points to 75 basis points, reflecting about 100 basis points of gross margin expansion behind lower commodity costs, partially offset by continued global inflation impacting manufacturing and logistics costs. Other factors pressuring EBIT margin include inflation in international markets and weaker currencies. In addition, we anticipate incremental investments to sustain our future cost savings pipeline and consumer demand-building programs to support the long-term health of our brands.","We project selling and administrative expenses to be about 14% of sales in fiscal year 2016. We continue to anticipate our tax rate for the full year on earnings from continuing operations to be between 34% and 35%. And, net of all of these factors, we now anticipate our fiscal year 2016 outlook for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.75 to $4.90 versus our previous outlook of $4.68 to $4.83.","In closing, we feel very good about delivering strong results in the first half of the fiscal year. Our business is healthy and we remain committed to our long-term strategy of driving profitable growth.","And with that, I will turn it over to Benno.","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Steve, and hello, everyone. We are very pleased with our second quarter and first half results. We're especially pleased to have delivered 18% diluted EPS growth in Q2, driven by robust margin expansion. Clearly, our strategy is continuing to work and deliver strong results for our shareholders, and we remain committed to investing in the business to drive profitable growth. And we're certainly pleased to have raised our EPS outlook for the full year.","And with that, let me share my perspective on our Q2 results, the effectiveness of our strategy, and our outlook for the second half. First, we delivered solid Q2 results. Our U.S. business achieved sales growth with gains across all business segments and our International business delivered healthy sales growth on a currency-neutral basis. Strong innovation, coupled with our increased demand-building investments translated to U.S. market share and category growth. Through our last reporting period, International also realized meaningful share growth. And we achieved healthy margin expansion of more than 200 basis points to deliver our highest second quarter gross margin in more than five years.","Second, our 2020 Strategy is continuing to work and we'll continue leaning in to drive growth that is profitable and sustainable. In the U.S., we launched a number of new products late in Q2 and, while it's still early, we are encouraged by the initial consumer response. We have additional promising innovation launching across our portfolio in Q3. We continue to eliminate costs that are not meaningful to consumers and reinvest the savings into the business, such as, by leveraging technology to engage with consumers and drive household penetration. We are very pleased our domestic business is healthy.","In International, where the profitability of our business remains challenged due to weakening foreign currencies, our team is relentlessly focused on the four pillars of our Go Lean strategy to improve profitability. And I feel very good about the future of our International business, recognizing the fundamental strength of our brands in many countries, which is reflected in increased market shares.","So we feel very good about our strong second quarter and first half results. And while we're very pleased with our strong year-to-date performance, I want to emphasize that we focus on driving sustained performance over the long term, consistent with our 2020 Strategy. And given that long-term focus, as Steve Robb noted, we're considering investing in some supply chain-related projects that will feed our future cost savings pipeline and benefit margins in future years. We're also increasing our demand-building investments in the back half of this fiscal year to keep our brands healthy and growing in the face of anticipated competitive activity in selective categories. And I'm pleased that we're able to make these investments for the long-term health of the business while also raising our earnings outlook for the current fiscal year.","With that, let's open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Dorer. We'll hear first from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good afternoon, folks. Thanks for letting me ask a question. You've been talking for a while now about the risk of stepped-up competitive aggression, the need to maybe dial back or reinvest some of your prior price increases. Based on the tenor of your comments, it sounds like that may be becoming a reality now with higher trade spend this quarter, the caution about an intense \u2013 more intense competitive activity in the back half and the need to reinvest. Is that a fair statement? And can you elaborate further in terms of the shape of the reinvestment? What do you expect the A&P to look like for the year? And as you step-up trade spend, is there a risk that the price line actually reverts into negative territory for the U.S.?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Jason, this is Steve Robb. Let me lead off on this. So, first, to provide some color, just like we said at the end of the first quarter, we do anticipate stepping up the level of consumer demand-building investment pretty significantly in the second half. I think you're going to see a split of that investment, some is going to go into trade promotion spending and then I think some is going to go into advertising.","To dimensionalize it, over the long-term, we talk about advertising being at this 9% to 10% of sales level. I think it's likely we'll be above 10% in the second half of the fiscal year. And a lot of this is to support our new products. One of the things we know is we've got these preferred products so if we can get trial we get repeat. So you're going to see us continue to lean in on both the innovation as well as some of our base products. And then the spend should start to ramp-up as you move through the second half of the fiscal year.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So real quick, just to clarify, the rhetoric on preparing for more intense in-store competitive activity in the second half, is that a reality you're beginning to see? Or is this just the same cautionary language that we've been hearing from you for a while?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I would say, as we said in the last quarter, we anticipated a step-up in competition because what we know is that when you build share quarter-after-quarter, typically the competition at a certain point leans back in. So, at this point, we're starting to see it in a couple of categories. Glad, where you've got lower commodity costs, people are spending back in the market. And so we think it's prudent to step-up our level of investment, in particular because we've got good things to advertise and we've got preferred brands. So we continue to anticipate it. We're seeing a little of it now. We'll have to see how the second half unfolds.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","And next we'll hear from Steve Powers with UBS.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Great. So actually just cleaning up on that, so should we be expecting more like 150 basis points to 200 basis points of incremental demand-building in the second half between trade and A&P because it doesn't feel like we've seen that 100 basis points that you had aimed for the full year so far through the first two quarters?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, fair enough. In the first half of the fiscal, I would say most of the incremental consumer demand-building investment, which there has been some, is really been focused on trade spending and it's been a little bit less than a point. You will see a meaningful step-up in second half, both in advertising, as well as trade spending and that's actually one of the reasons why the margins in the second half, EBIT margins in particular, are expected to be down versus a year ago. Again, we think it's prudent to take some of these commodity cost tailwinds we're seeing and invest it right back into our business, as we mentioned in our opening comments.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Great. And then I guess a main question on Hidden Valley, actually if I could, and really dressings in general. I'm just curious to see if you're seeing any signs or anticipating any change in the competitive environment in that category specifically? Because I'm thinking on the one hand you've got your main, one of your main competitors who has just gone through the process of in-sourcing production, presumably with the aim of accelerating innovation. And on the other hand, you've got Heinz Kraft who's shown what they can do when they focus their trade spend muscle on a category like mustard. So how are you guys thinking about monitoring those dynamics? Or do you think I'm portraying the environment incorrectly? Thanks.","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Steve, this is Benno. Look, this is a competitive category and always has been a competitive category, but we continue to be optimistic about this and we're doing well in the marketplace. Our innovations are successful. As I'm thinking about Ranch with where we have noted previously that we've gained more than 10 share points behind our expansion in this important segment. And we continue to have innovation both in the core as well as in adjacent spaces in food coming as well. So we remain focused on investing in the health of the business. We're doing well in the marketplace and I'm not expecting at this point a fundamental change to our strategy, nor to the dynamics in the category.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey guys, good morning. Hey, I'm trying to figure out your gross margin guidance for the year because it looks like it's going be flat in the back half, which doesn't make a lot of sense given you've kind of said, like, most of the front half spending was promotional and the back half is going to be advertising. So any color on that would be super helpful. And then I have a follow-up.","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah sure, Bill. This is Steve Robb. Let me answer that question for you. So as you've said, gross margin in the first half is certainly up nicely. I think we're up a little over two full points which feels pretty good. We do anticipate, on a full-year basis, gross margin will be up about a point. Could be a little above that or a little below depending on how things play out. But it's likely to be flattish in the second half and the reason for that is a couple of fold.","First, we're just starting to anniversary some tougher comps in gross margin. If you look at the second half of fiscal 2015, you'll see that our gross margin stepped up quite a bit, so we're certainly comping that and actually holding onto those gains feels pretty good. The second thing is we will be increasing our trade promotion spending and that's certainly going to weigh on the gross margin. And then finally, we took some pricing. We're starting to anniversary as we move through the second half some of the pricing benefits that have been flowing through gross margin in the first half of this year.","And while we absolutely expect commodities will be a tailwind in the second half, it's going to be less of a tailwind than you saw in the first half, again because we're starting to comp some of the benefits we saw in the second half of fiscal 2015. So from our perspective, we think we've got very healthy gross margins. We certainly feel good about the trends. And importantly, we feel very good about the full year outlook for the EBIT margin that we've shared with you today.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then just Argentina and Canada, which we never talk about. What are they as a percentage of sales and profits? And how localized is production? Because obviously both of those currencies have gotten a little wonky recently. So I'm just trying to figure out what the transaction impact might be.","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, so let's take each one separately. First, starting with Argentina. Argentina represents about 4% of our sales. Now let me be clear. That was before the devaluation that we saw in December, which you might recall, we anticipated and built into our outlook. So I think on a go-forward basis, Argentina's probably something like 3% to 4% of our sales. Not the largest part of our business. And I would say just related to the devaluation of Argentina, we anticipated it. It's unfolding about as we had expected. I do think in the second half of the fiscal year and probably for calendar 2016, Argentina will weigh on results a bit following the devaluation. But generally, I feel pretty good about the long-term direction of the country, some of the changes they're making. And importantly, because we anticipated this, we have good plans, we're executing it well and things are coming in as expected. Canada, let's, Steve, do you want to take the Canadian question?","Steven Austenfeld - Vice President-Investor Relations","Yeah, Bill. Canada's also about 3% to 4% of our sales. Unlike Argentina, which doesn't have as much transaction exposure, there are some items that we sell in Canada that are manufactured in the U.S., so they do have some U.S. dollar exposure which will give us a little bit of a headwind on the gross margin line from a transaction exposure standpoint, but I wouldn't call it significant.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. And sorry I promise, just one more quick one. If I look at the Nielsen data, it doesn't seem like your promotional spending is ticking up if you look at percentage of sales on deal. So what's kind of missing based on what you guys said about the roughly 100 basis points of higher promotional spending?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Again, most of the incremental investment that you're going to be seeing is going to be in the second half of the fiscal year. It has stepped up in the first half but you may not be seeing all of that in the numbers. But I do think particularly as we move to the third quarter and certainly well into the fourth quarter, you will see a step-up both in advertising as well as trade promotion investment.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Moving on, we'll hear from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein Research.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. So if I look at your gross margin benefit that you're getting from commodities going down and pricing going up, this kind of sweet spot, right, where the commodities are going down and the pricing is still up, and you go across time, this 290 basis points for this quarter is relatively high. If we look back, it looks like there's kind of calendar year 2009 was a time where you also had some of these benefits at this much of a positive from both of those. But what happened after that, very much as you describe, is that gross margins were a little bit more challenged. And I get that. You have to put more back into trade spend. You have to invest on the commodity, Steve, as you said, back into the business. And so that I get your guidance going forward, and feels like it will be next four quarters, not just the back half of the year.","But what also happened subsequent was that your top line fell quite flat. That was a very different timeframe, arguably, but really it was like a two-point drop in your top line growth as you had to spend back perhaps more than anticipated into the business from commodities. So it wasn't just a gross margin issue, it was also the top line start to slow. And I ask \u2013 I noticed that in the context of your 3% to 4% organic sales growth going forward and trying to understand how you're making sure that you're not going to see the top line slowdown dramatically as well as it has done when you've kind of exited this sweet spot of commodities and pricing.","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Ali, this is Steve Robb. That's a great question, which is why we're investing for incremental profitable growth. So one of the reasons we're taking some of the commodity goodness we've been seeing in the last couple of quarters, we're putting it back into the innovation. We're putting it into our new products. We're supporting our base business, which is why, as I had mentioned in my opening comments, we feel quite good about volume growth in the second half of this fiscal year. We anticipate fairly strong volume growth. So I would say that we're playing for the long-term. We're focused on delivering not just good quarters but, more importantly, good years consistently over time. And by making these incremental investments, we think that it'll lead to better long-term performance for the company.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So \u2013 sorry, do you want to add something, or no?","Steven Austenfeld - Vice President-Investor Relations","Sorry. Ali, it's Steve Austenfeld. I would just point out as well, in comparison to that time period you're referring to, our categories are much stronger and much healthier than they were a year ago. I mentioned earlier in my prepared remarks, our categories up about 2%, and that's been pretty consistent over the last several quarters to almost a year. So I think we feel much more confident not only in the strength of our brands, as Steve noted, and the investment we're making, but just in the underlying health of our categories.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And from the competitive \u2013 that's helpful \u2013 and from the competitive angle, you mentioned a couple categories, a couple of competitors who are taking their prices a little more aggressively it sounds like. Can you characterize it a little bit more? So is it the private label folks who want to drive trial and so they're starting to get more aggressive on taking the commodity benefit to the consumer? Are you hearing anything from Walmart, your biggest customer, 26%, 27% of sales? Is it the branded players? And as a subset of that, can you discuss a little bit your price gap versus your peer group, your competitors in some of these categories? And are there still places there out of whack?","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Ali, this is Benno. The last one up front, price gaps are about where we want them to be, and I would not consider them to be out of whack. If you think about competition, we've previously talked about three categories in order to reemphasize that that's really where the competitive focus is. The first one is Glad trash, where through lower commodities we are seeing private label and the one branded competitor. What we're anticipating that some of that commodity goodness is being passed on through trade spend, and we are certainly planning for that.","Home Care is a business where we've been very successful, and we certainly noted that in our Q2 remarks, and where we've been gaining market share over a number of periods. And we expect that category in particular in wipes, which is the hot bed where we're doing particularly well, to become more competitive from a branded competitor point of view in the back half. And then in Litter, as Steve Robb noted earlier, we have innovation coming up that we believe in, in Fresh Step with Febreze, and we're investing incrementally behind that innovation.","So it really is a case by case but we think it's very prudent for us to plan for that. Our strategy calls for an acceleration of profitable growth, and the increase in spend is certainly very consistent with that.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And still in those categories. Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. My first question is sort of a follow-on to that. I know one of the things you talked about back at the Analyst Day was sort of the way you have shifted your focus and expanded your focus or broadened your focus with regard to specific retail channels. So in terms of the incremental trade promotion, would you say there's a consistent level of trade promotion that you're engaged in across the retail channels? Or is the fact that you're putting particular money into grocery in some areas, boosting that level of spending as well?","And sort of related to that, can you talk about Burt's Bees specifically? We got the gift box of lipsticks in the mail and they were fabulous. So they looked great. But my question was, wow, this is something that's very different than we've seen in the past from Burt's Bees. This doesn't feel like a drugstore product. How much is the retail distribution for Burt's Bees specifically changing?","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Wendy, on retail channels first, so our policies are fair and equitable, right? So we do not favor any channel over the other on trade. So we want to make sure that all of our retailers have the same access to the same plans. So we should not expect any increase in trade promotion on selected businesses to favor any channel over the other.","On Burt's Bees, thank you. I'm very happy you liked it. And that's very consistent with the initial consumer response that we get and certainly also the response from our customers. This has been a great quarter on Burt's Bees where we delivered double-digit growth on top of double-digit growth the year ago, and we're investing behind lipsticks but also the base business to keep it that way.","Look, it's a pretty attractive price point. The lipsticks I'm referring to, $8.99. It's really a great product that has unique moisturizing benefits, and we think that compared to some of the more expensive brands out there this delivers terrific value to consumers. And like I said, the initial customer response is very positive and we'll continue to drive that, without losing focus on the base business. We have still a tremendous opportunity to drive the businesses across lip, face, body, that we're already in and we'll continue to have a balanced investment program.","Certainly, I think some of you had noted that while we've seen a solid sales increase in the lifestyle segments that the profitability has not followed that sales increase and that is because we're investing incrementally in the business, which is a reflection of the optimism that we have behind Burt's Bees and the other brands in the Lifestyle segment.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","But that distribution, the double-digit growth on top of double-digit growth, is that organic or is that the result of expanded distribution?","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","Well, certainly if you think about it, Wendy, just from a lipstick point of view, that distribution of course is incremental. But I would still look at that as organic because we've now just entered a new segment through innovation. And, from that, we will draw value down the road. So I would look at it as organic but certainly the distribution growth on lipstick and other new innovation has contributed to the double digit growth for the quarter.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. And then just \u2013 I don't know that I heard a direct answer to Ali's questions specifically about Walmart. I think ever since Walmart came out \u2013 whatever, a year ago, and said, hey, we're going go after these companies for more trade promotional dollars and all that kind of stuff and SKU rationalization, and you guys have said historically no, nothing's changed really. Just to be crystal clear, the increases that you're putting forth now or you're planning to put forth in terms of trade promotion, it's coming from you? It's not a request on the part of the retailers asking for more from you?","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","No. So the increase is proactive, and like I said earlier, will impact all retailers.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah.","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","I know you'll understand that we don't discuss specific plans by retailer. But what I can tell you is that the level of strategic alignment that we have with Walmart continues to be very strong. We are growing very nicely with Walmart. Our business is very strong and we have a strong innovation pipeline with Walmart, which leads to the fact that the vast majority of the conversations we continue to have with that customer are around how we can grow their categories and our brands with them for the benefit of their shopper. So once again, the trade spend increase is planned and will affect all retailers and is not in response to whatever might have happened or is rumored to happen with any specific retailer.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Terrific. Thank you.","Operator","Moving on, we'll hear from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. I love the lipstick, too. Very moisturizing. Just want to talk a little bit about International. You guys have enormous experienced pricing in the U.S. and have had a very good read on elasticity and how things would progress both as pricing goes in and as you anniversary it. Can you talk about your confidence into the quality of your analytics internationally and where you think elasticities have kind of been as you expected or better or worse? Thanks.","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we feel equally confident in our ability to take pricing in International. And we are, in fact, taking pricing across a number of the International businesses today. So I wouldn't say, Lauren, that there's a difference between U.S. and International, and our track record to take pricing in International is very strong. Now, at this point, are we able to close the entire gap that we see from \u2013 or the entire amount of cost increases that we're seeing through inflation in International? No. But we are taking pricing pretty broadly. As you might have seen, our volume in International's been somewhat flat and our organic sales growth was 6%, and much of that difference was certainly driven by pricing. So I feel optimistic about where we are in pricing in International, and we have a pretty good read on what happens. And it's pretty much playing out in the marketplace as we expected.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Lauren.","Operator","Our next question comes from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Hi. Good afternoon over here. Good morning over there. My question tackles this trade spending decision whether it's reactive or proactive from a longer term perspective. True, your gross margin is great this quarter, but it has been range bound for the last five years. So if categories are up 2%, which is a change in a long time, and you feel confident about the health of the categories, you feel confident about the innovation, there is a deflationary environment in commodities, it seems to me that you are kind of like leading the charge here in terms of the trade spending. Why? Shouldn't you actually heed or aim at expanding gross margins? So why is this? Thank you.","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Javier, this is Steve. I'll take that question. So when we look at trade spending, first, to be really clear and this is important, this is a choice we're making as a company. It's a choice to step up the level of in-store merchandising behind things like Burt's Bees or Litter with Febreze, because we think again we've got great products and if we get trial, we get repeat. We've talked to that before. I think in some categories like Glad, what you see is when you \u2013 the commodities come down. The good news is you get a bit of a tailwind in margin, but you also tend to see a bit more money go into the market. And what we tend do is adjust our trade spending up and down to reflect that in selected categories.","So what I would say is when we look over the long term, you'll see us do two things. One, if commodities start to recover, and we don't think that'll happen in the short term, but as they recover, you'll see us probably make adjustments in the trade spending in selected categories. I think we've demonstrated that we know how to manage our trade spending and commodities over time. And then second, these dollars can move around on the P&L. We may put more into advertising or R&D. The key for us is to invest for profitable growth and just stay true to the 2020 Strategy. So again, I think we feel good about the choices we're making today, but we retain the flexibility to make different choices in the future as the markets evolve.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Just a clarification, right, in theory, we all like the notion of gross margin to spend because it will give you more wiggle room in terms of how much, whether you spend in trade spending, whether you spend in advertising. So why is it that then structurally your businesses don't allow for gross margin expansion? Because it seems to me that you're saying, well, basically the second half is going to be flat even though all these positive things. And it's kind of like confusing because it at some point, it seems as if you're leading the charge as if you don't want to maintain the pricing environment that would allow to build gross margin, \u00e0 la, Colgate, say.","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","The one thing \u2013 Javier, this is Benno \u2013 I would say that we should not assume that trade spending is pricing. One thing that Steve Robb noted earlier is that a lot of the spend in the back half, as was the case in the front half, went into the support for our innovations, innovation to generate trial for which we get a great return, which we know from our analytics. So trade spend isn't bad. Trade spend is spending that drives our brand equities. And I think you know that we have a very disciplined approach to how we spend. We spend where we get the greatest ROI short term and long term and we believe that trade, in particular doing times when you have strong innovation, certainly plays a role in driving our brand equities and continuing driving the strong brand health that we have today and that we expect to have in the future too.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC","But just to finish up, is this innovation gross margin accretive? Do you plan to maximize the product mix with this innovation? Because then I don't understand still why gross margin cannot build up from here.","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","We have an internal criterion and that is that innovation has to be gross margin accretive to the company. And then if you think about some of the innovation that we invest in at this point, for instance Burt's Bees lipsticks, you can imagine that those are very attractive businesses where we get a great return in the long term. And if we can drive trial behind what undoubtedly is a great product, which we know from internal testing, as well as if you go for instance on any of the sites that consumers use to post reviews, the initial consumer response is very enthusiastic. This is a great investment. It is an investment for the long term and certainly not an investment to maximize the profitability on lipsticks for any given quarter. But how can we not invest in the long-term health of this business if we have promising innovation like that? So we're taking the long-term view and we're not afraid to invest behind it, even though in any given quarter, short term it might not maximize gross margins or the profitability of the business.","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And, Javier.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Understood.","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Just, I'm sorry. The last point I would like to make, just for the record on gross margin, in fiscal 2015, our gross margin was up 90 basis points. Call that about a point. This year, we anticipate gross margin being up about a point. And, importantly, we're investing more in our cost savings pipeline over time. So the idea that we can't expand gross margins, we've been doing that for six quarters, and we've got some very results that we've been posting. So we certainly feel good about the plans we have in place to expand EBIT margins 25 bps to 50 bps over the long-term annually.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","And we'll hear next from John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. Thank you. Ben, I want to talk a little bit about uses of cash, and we've generally seen a little bit of a slowdown in the repurchase over the past couple of quarters, which makes some sense. And you're down below the low-end of your leverage ratio, and Don used to talk a lot about sort of the tuck-in acquisition piece surrounding healthcare. Can you give us maybe your view of M&A in terms of where that could be different? And would that lead to something where you could foresee something bigger happening? Or should we still \u2013 I know you mentioned tuck-in in the slides at the Analyst Day, but are you taking sort of a more holistic view of the M&A opportunities as you look at where you stand right now? Thanks.","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","So no change in strategy. Tuck-ins are still preferred and what we have said in the past, which continues to be true, John, is that natural personal care, broader healthcare, or health and wellness and food enhancers are businesses and categories that we're strongly interested in.","We have certainly noted that we're looking at everything. If we think that it adds value to our shareholders and as you can imagine we look at a lot of things throughout the year as do our competitors, I presume. But what we are after is businesses that are a strong fit with our strategy, that are attractive from a growth as well as a margin perspective, and, importantly, businesses that we can get at a good value.","So we will stay disciplined. We will look for the right opportunity. And we do that all through the lens of making sure that whatever we might do in the future creates value for our shareholders. So I would characterize that as staying the course. We have preferences but, look, you can never say never. We look at everything, and a lot of things throughout the course of the year through the lens of making sure that we create value.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. And then just one sort of quick follow-up on that which is, is tuck-in defined more by \u2013 you talked about it more from, let's say, a segment standpoint or a category standpoint \u2013 is tuck-in defined more by segment or in terms of something you already have? Or is that more of a size component? How would you define that, or is it both?","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","I mean, we \u2013 I would say, it's both. Look, again, we have a preference for acquisitions of a certain size, but we also want to make sure that whatever we might do is a good fit with our capabilities and close in. So it's a combination of both.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","That will conclude our question-and-answer session for today. Mr. Dorer, I would like to turn the program back to you.","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thank you. To sum up, we're very pleased our strategy continues to work and delivered strong Q2 results. Our business is fundamentally healthy, and we're pleased to have raised our outlook, which we believe presents a balanced view of the challenges and opportunities we see for our business during the second half of the fiscal year.

Steve will then follow with a review of our financial performance in the quarter, our updated outlook for fiscal year '12, as well as our initial outlook for fiscal year '13. Finally, before turning to Q&A, Don will close, noting a few key focus areas for the company as we head into next fiscal year. ","With that, let me turn it over to Larry.","Lawrence S. Peiros","Thanks, and hello to everybody on the call. As Steve said, I'm going to focus my comments on market share, volume and sales and provide perspective on what drove our top line results. ","Overall, our third quarter top line performance was very strong, benefiting from strong organic sales, as well as the impact of our recent acquisitions. We delivered volume growth of 4% and sales growth of 7%. Even without the acquisitions, volume was up a solid 2% and sales grew a very strong 6%, with sales outpacing volume due to price increases across most of the portfolio.","We saw sales growth in all 4 business segments and almost every individual business unit. Our new product innovation program continues to have record levels, and our integrated marketing plans continue to deliver. In particular, strong merchandising activity contributed to our top line results this quarter as several key retailers chose Clorox brands to drive store traffic in their overall sales. We feel great about the quarter and the progress we are making in driving top line growth in what remains a challenging environment.","In our U.S. business, our all-outlet market share reached a record high. We're up about 0.5 a share point over the past 52 weeks to a 28% share. Moreover, we gained or helped share in every one of our reported U.S. categories. These share results reinforce the strength of our brands, especially given the large number of recent price increases. ","The other good news is that our U.S. categories are getting healthier as pricing takes hold and the economy recovers. Overall category consumption on an all-outlet basis was flat for the past 52 weeks versus a decline of about 2% just a year ago.","Our Cleaning segment, which includes our Home Care, Laundry and Away From Home businesses, delivered a very strong quarter, with volume up 7% and sales up 10%. Excluding the 2 recent acquisitions in our Away From Home business, segment sales were up 5%. All 3 business units in this segment saw sales growth in the quarter, driven by price increases and innovation. ","Home Care grew sales and share behind a double-digit volume increase on Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, gains in several other Home Care brands, as well as innovations like our Clorox Bleach Foamer spray and Liquid-Plumr Double Impact drain cleaner. ","On our Laundry business, we grew sales and increased our 52-week all-outlet market share for the second straight quarter. Our focus on attracting new users with our new Bleachable Moments marketing plan appears to be getting some early traction. We also saw growth behind the launch of new Clorox Bleach Gel, a thicker formula and a precision pour spout bottle for use in high-efficiency washing machines.","Finally, our Away From Home business delivered strong organic growth through expanded distribution in health care channels and several new products designed for the professional market. The 2 Away From Home acquisitions, which closed on December 31, Aplicare and HealthLink, are on track with our integration efforts. ","In our Household segment, which includes Bags and Wraps, Charcoal and Cat Litter, volume grew 2% and sales grew 6%. Glad delivered solid increases in volume and sales on trash bags, driven by heavy merchandising on Glad OdorShield with Febreze. Glad food storage products also registered strong gains behind increased merchandising and some new items in our GladWare line.","Charcoal were up high single digits, driven by warm weather triggering a strong start to the grilling season. ","Cat Litter volume and sales in Q3 were equal to the year ago quarter. Fresh Step saw solid sales growth, driven by merchandising behind our new Fresh Step Extreme, but gains were largely offset by declines in Scoop Away due to lower merchandising versus a year ago. On an all-outlet basis, Cat Litter reached a record-level market share, up about 2 share points over the past 52-week period. ","In our Lifestyle segment, which includes Food Products, Water Filtration and Natural Personal Care, volume grew 4% and sales grew 10%. All 3 business units in this segment grew both volume and sales. ","Sales were up strongly in our Food business behind the impact of price increases, shipment gains in dry salad dressing and pipeline shipments of new bottled salad dressing flavors. ","Brita grew sales and volume at double-digit rates behind the continued success of the Brita Bottle. We have already launched a variety of new bottles in different colors and will continue to innovate against this platform in the future. ","Finally, our Burt's Bees business had a solid quarter, driven by growth from new products in the U.S. and gains in International. Gud, our new natural personal care brand, continues to track to expectations in the early going. ","In our International segment, volume was up 1% and sales were up 4%. In Latin America, our largest international region, volume was up and sales grew mid-single digits, a solid result despite double-digit volume declines in Venezuela resulting from the Venezuelan government's recently implemented price control law. Volume was down slightly in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, but was more than offset by volume growth in other parts of the world. ","Our International segment share results continue to be mixed, with 52-week shares equal to year ago in Latin American and down in Canada and Australia. Category dollar sales growth remained quite strong in Latin America, with slower growth in other global markets.","Overall, we feel very good about our top line results this quarter. We're pleased that our price increases continue to play out as anticipated, contributing to sales growth for our brands and our categories. Our record U.S. share reflects that we are doing the right thing to grow our brands in a very tough environment. ","Based on our sales performance year-to-date, we now expect our fiscal '12 sales to be about 4% for the full year. This reflects very solid top line performance in Q4 versus our strongest quarter in that fiscal year. We also believe that the unseasonably warm weather in Q3 may have pulled some Q4 Charcoal volume into Q3.","Looking forward, our sales outlook for fiscal '13 is 2% to 4%, reflecting continued momentum supported by further innovation across our brands but moderated by uncertainty in some International markets and a tougher comparison to strong fiscal '12 sales growth. ","With that, I'll turn it over to Steve.","Stephen M. Robb","Thanks, Larry. Hello, everyone. I'm going to provide more depth on our third quarter financial results and our updated outlook for fiscal '12, as well as our preliminary outlook for fiscal '13. ","As Larry noted, sales were up a strong 7% in the quarter, with gains in all 4 reporting segments. Excluding the impact of the Aplicare and HealthLink acquisitions, sales growth was up 6%, driven by 5 points of pricing and 2 points from base volume growth. This was partially offset by a higher trade spending and negative mix. ","Third quarter gross margin decreased 180 basis points to 42.3% of sales compared with 44.1% in the year ago quarter. As expected, the biggest single factor in the gross margin decrease was inflation affecting both commodities and other supply chain costs. ","The other negative factor was unfavorable product and country mix. While we had very strong merchandising support from our retailers, it was often for larger value-oriented sizes, where margins are somewhat lower. ","Volume in the quarter also continued to shift to countries which have lower margins. On the positive side, the combined benefit of price increases and cost savings came in as expected.","Turning to selling and administrative expenses, the rate of spending came in at about 15%, within the expected range. The year-over-year increase reflected higher compensation revenues and our investments in IT systems and new R&D facilities. ","Net of all of the factors I've discussed, we delivered earnings in continuing operations of $134 million or $1.02 diluted earnings per share. This compares with $141 million or $1.02 in the year ago quarter. ","Year-to-date, free cash flow from continuing operations was $214 million versus $228 million in the same period year ago. The decrease was driven by lower tax payments in the year ago period as a result of favorable tax depreciation rules and the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts related to the $300 million debt issuance in the second quarter of this fiscal year.","For the full year, we anticipate free cash flow of about 9% of sales. As a reminder, we define free cash flow as cash provided by operations less capital expenditures. ","For the quarter, we ended with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.6:1, slightly above our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x, driven by the recent acquisitions. We continue to anticipate returning to within our targeted range by the end of the fiscal year.","Next, I'll turn to our financial outlook for fiscal '12. We now anticipate sales growth of about 4% for the year, which reflects improving U.S. categories, strong year-to-date results and the benefit of recent acquisitions, which are expected to add about 0.5 point to growth this year and about a point ongoing. ","Turning to gross margins. We now expect a decrease in the range of 125 to 150 basis points for the full fiscal year. The decrease versus our prior outlook is being driven by year-to-date gross margin results and continued pressure in the fourth quarter due to unfavorable country mix, as well the continued shift to larger sizes. ","Our assumptions for commodity cost increases and other inflationary pressures remain unchanged versus our prior outlook. Our assumptions for cost savings and pricing also remain generally unchanged. ","Our multi-year plan for global IT systems and R&D facility investments remains on track. We continue to anticipate combined infrastructure and restructuring-related expenses in the range of $50 million to $55 million in fiscal '12. ","We also continue to anticipate selling and administrative expenses to be at or slightly below 15% of sales, which includes our assumptions for infrastructure investments, as well as administrative costs for the newly acquired businesses. Net of all these factors, we continue to anticipate diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of $4 to $4.10 for the full fiscal year.","Next, I'll turn to our outlook for fiscal '13. As Larry noted, we anticipate sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%, driven by moderate category improvement, innovation and price increases, although likely a more limited amount of pricing than we executed in fiscal '12. ","We expect EBIT margins will be about flat versus fiscal '12 as modest gross margin improvement will be offset by slightly higher administrative expenses due in part to the acquisitions. Within gross margin, cost savings are expected to add about 150 basis points of benefit. ","Commodity cost increases are anticipated to negatively impact margins by more than a point with a similar amount impacting manufacturing and logistics costs. In response, we are planning to take a modest amount of pricing, although the final amount will depend on the extent of the inflationary pressures. ","Within selling and administrative expense, we continue to anticipate expenses for restructuring and other related costs, including systems and facilities investments, to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million or about equal to fiscal '12. Both projects are still expected to be completed by the end of fiscal '13. ","Our outlook also includes a onetime gain of $0.05 to $0.07 related to real estate optimization initiatives, including the planned sale of our former R&D facility in Pleasanton, California. These gains are likely to be reflected as a part of other income. ","Finally, we expect a effective tax rate in fiscal '13 of approximately 34%, which will more than offset the anticipated onetime gain from our real estate initiatives. Net of all of these factors, we anticipate fiscal '13 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of $4.20 to $4.35. ","We also anticipate free cash flow in the range of 9% to 10% of sales in fiscal '13. Priorities for excess cash include investing in organic and inorganic growth, supporting the dividend, repurchasing shares to offset stock option dilution and possibly making open market purchases. ","We project capital spending in the range of $230 million to $240 million, which includes investment in systems and facilities. Separately, the company also anticipates generating additional cash flow from the proceeds of the planned real estate initiatives. ","With that, I'll turn it over to Don to recap, and then we'll open it up for questions.","Donald R. Knauss","Thanks, Steve, and hello, everyone. Obviously, we're very pleased to deliver the highest year-over-year quarterly growth in 3 years and built on the top line growth trend we've seen throughout the year, which, I think, as you know now, has delivered 5% year-to-date sales growth. Our strong top line performance and record-high U.S. market share, I think, does really speak to our strong execution and the power inherent in our brands. ","I think one of the really rewarding things about the quarter is we continued to see retailers choosing our brands to generate traffic and return our mutual categories to growth, resulting in distribution gains and some increased merchandising as we noted for the third quarter in particular. At the same time, we continue to see commodity cost increases, general inflationary factors and mix challenges pressuring our margins, as Steve just talked about. And we have an intense focus on this to improve margins over time. ","Now turning to FY '13 and the outlook we provided today, I believe we have strong plans in place to deliver our top line margin and EPS targets for fiscal year '13. And as we look ahead to that year, I'd like to just reiterate to you the focus we have on 3 things in particular. ","First, building our brands and categories through this continued 3D execution that we do, I think, extremely well, including another strong stream of innovation in providing customer capabilities that our retail partners really value. And just as a side note again, our innovation should reach an all-time high this year, north of 3% growth, so we continue to build on that pipeline. ","Second, building our margins with a real focus on cost and optimizing product and channel mix, which will be a real focus as we move into '13. ","And then lastly, completing our IT systems and R&D facility improvements to help drive cost savings and growth over the long term. So we're certainly optimistic about our plans. We're confident in our ability to execute those plans and drive long-term shareholder value. ","With that, why don't we open up the lines for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Question has to do with the outlook for 2013 and the guidance for sort of flat EBIT growth. And I guess that's a little disappointing just particularly in the context of the restructuring charges that you've taken kind of annually regularly, and it just doesn't seem that there are real savings dropping to the bottom line. So I guess, number one, is that just sort of a one-off thing in 2013 and you hope that, that expands or accelerates as we go forward into 2014? Because the real question is, how is the growth algorithm going to work? We're sort of stuck in this mid-single digit earnings growth rate range, and I'm wondering when we're going to sort of tick back up into the high single digits.","Stephen M. Robb","Wendy, this is Steve Robb. Let me take a portion of this. First of all, let me start with margin. And the big thing to recognize next year is that our EBIT margin is expected to be flat. Now first, turning to the gross margins, our gross margin, we are expecting modest improvement in gross margin next year. And the reason that we are optimistic that we're going to see margins begin to stabilize and improve as we go into next year is because, first, we've got the benefits of the pricing that we've taken, which has gone extremely well. In fact, pricing has probably gone better than we expected, and we're continuing to build all-outlet market share. We're continuing to target cost savings of about 150 basis points each year. And also, we're pretty optimistic on our ability to deliver innovation that will be margin accretive over time. Now when you take those 3 factors and then you look at commodity cost, which are expected to go up next year, along with other inflationary pressures, they're going to go up but they're going to go up less than we saw this year, so they're going to be increasing, call it, 2% to 3% versus the 3% to 4% we had this year. And when you net all of that together, we believe we're going to get modest gross margin improvement. Now that said, we are making incremental investments in the infrastructure that we've been talking about, so SG&A is expected to be slightly higher than this fiscal year. And when you net it, we're looking at flat EBIT margins. I think longer term, as we look forward, we would expect that improving gross margins, anniversary-ing some of these infrastructure investments will enable us to begin to build the EBIT margin, so that what you'll start to see is that the earnings growth will begin to grow faster than the sales growth more consistent with what we've seen in earlier years.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","But if you're already anticipating the commodity costs are going up and you feel like you've been successful with the price increases you've taken, I guess -- I mean we're looking at a year that is more than 12 months out, right? And so I guess I'm just surprised between selling Auto and making the higher-margin acquisitions and all of that, it sort of surprises me that you can't manage the business better, take the price increases faster, shift the mix of commodities, I don't know what -- shift the mix of the business. Because flat EBIT margins kind of year in and year out, I mean, we're pretty far off the peak EBIT margins. I'm just surprised that we're not recovering faster.","Stephen M. Robb","Yes, well, we are continuing to focus on, number one, focusing on that gross margin and getting it to recover. And again, I think, as we've indicated, we do expect that gross margin will begin to increase modestly next year, although it's going to take some time. And certainly, it is taking longer to rebuild the margins than we had originally anticipated. Again, I would just echo that as we work through these infrastructure investments and start to anniversary that into fiscal '14, we would expect that those EBIT margins will begin to increase again, and you'll start to see that flow through.","Donald R. Knauss","Wendy, this is Don. I do feel good about the way we've managed the pricing and the cost savings, frankly. I think to have reached an all-time high market share when you've taken 400 basis points of pricing, I think it says that we're managing these brands very well. I do think, obviously, in addition to the commodity increases we've seen this year and other inflation, I think in the third quarter, in particular, which I don't think is a trend, is the mix issue that we had to confront with some fairly very successful merchandising that we didn't anticipate it growing in the large sizes as fast as it did. We certainly see that moderating as we go into the fourth quarter into fiscal '13, so I think we'll continue to see some benefit there. But I think we've managed the pricing on these brands extremely well.","Operator","And our next question comes from Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of pieces here. Could you give a little bit more detail what's driving the tax rate guidance? You said, clearly, that that's going to offset some of the things looking into 2013 to a degree. So if you could give a little bit of detail there? And then the Charcoal, do you think -- you mentioned that you thought you could have seen some pull forward here in the fiscal third quarter. I guess, why do you believe that versus maybe that you would maybe be picking up a turn at retail and then still have the full benefits as you head into the summer months?","Stephen M. Robb","Let me start off and answer your tax question, and maybe I'll ask Larry to address Charcoal. Turning to the tax, historically, our tax rate for Clorox usually runs in the range of 34% to 35%. Now for fiscal '12, the tax rate is anticipated to be about 32% to 33%, so it's actually a bit lower than what we've historically seen. And the reason for that is we've had some onetime tax settlements that have given us some benefits this fiscal year. So as we look to fiscal '13 and we project a tax rate of about 34%, we would just say that that's basically returning to more of a normalized tax rate for the company as opposed to something unusual.","Lawrence S. Peiros","To respond to your question on Charcoal, Charcoal quarterly volume is always hard for us to project because there is obviously always weather factors and a lot of merchandising factors. Typically, we smooth out over the course of a year but the quarterly estimates have a fairly wide error range. I think what we're seeing in our Charcoal business in Q3 is not only the obvious benefit of great weather but we did have -- in particular, one retailer that did some early merchandising of Charcoal at a very hot price, very large sizes, that sold a lot of Charcoal. And so what we're trying to sort out, how much of that is replacement of Charcoal that might be purchased at a later date, how much is Charcoal that may be used more because people have more in their homes. So -- and going through all those variables is hard. But we're thinking, between the good weather and some pretty heavy merchandising in Q3, there may have been some pull forward.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay. One other, if I may. A little bit more detail on the manufacturing and logistics cost pressures. I know it's probably a little bit of fuel in the logistics. But when do you anticipate those, especially on the manufacturing side, maybe getting some leverage off of those?","Stephen M. Robb","We've continued to see inflationary pressures on manufacturing and logistics. To your point, it includes things like diesel fuel, which, I think, everybody is aware has run up pretty strongly. It also includes just things like wage inflation, particularly in our international markets. Health care costs have been increasing. It's all of those things, and we do expect that will continue as we go into next year. And we are fully anticipating that and building plans that anticipate it and making sure that the pricing and other actions that we work to recover those costs.","Operator","And we will hear next from Chris Ferrara with Bank of America.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Guys, I wanted to talk a little bit more about the mix drivers you said. And I think, Don, you started to say that you expect it to subside. But I guess, moving to larger pack sizes isn't something new. I guess, what drove it this quarter? Why did retailers use you guys more for foot traffic drivers and why did you see this mix? I guess, could you just give a little more color around the dynamics of what happened this quarter?","Donald R. Knauss","Yes, let me start, then I'll ask Larry and Steve to jump in. Chris, I think -- first of all, I think everyone -- we should probably keep one quarter in perspective here. If you go back to last quarter, we had a 20 basis points contraction in gross margin and virtually no mix impact. We have traditionally had in the January, February, March quarter some interesting and unique merchandising events of fairly large scale. We had those again in this quarter and they did extremely well, with double-digit growth coming off of some of these merchandising events. So it really drove into larger sizes, twin packs, triple packs, things like that. So that -- as I said, Chris, that traditionally has happened in the January, February, March quarter. If you look at -- as we head into the fourth quarter this fiscal year and then into the first half of fiscal '13, we don't tend to have those same like -- same type of merchandising events concentrated in one quarter. So I think it is a bit of an aberration. What we'll do about that, obviously, is continue to look at -- as we take pricing, look at the pricing curves across channels and across product sizes. So we continue to sharpen our look at that and our analytics on that. But I wouldn't get this -- I wouldn't take this quarter and say it is a predictor of what's coming because we usually have this in this quarter. And again, I'd go back to last quarter when it didn't manifest itself at all.","Lawrence S. Peiros","So the only thing I'd add is, this is obviously kind of a mixed blessing. On one hand, we're selling a heck of a lot of product. These are big merchandising events. Big retailers are looking to our brands to drive store traffic in a big way. We're exceeding our objectives behind this promotion. So on one hand, you feel great about getting your products in more hands, more consumers' hands. On the other hand, it does change the mix a bit, and we do tend to sell a lot more large sizes when we have these big events. It is far more pronounced in Q3 than it is in any other quarter.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That helps. And I guess, just following up on that. Because it was such a big driver of mix -- I mean, if we'd expect a lot of this mix to subside simply because you don't have the same level of this nature of promotion in Q4, I mean, wouldn't that make you feel substantially better about gross margin? And I guess, a related follow-up on the top line. Do you get to give back on sales? I mean, is that a big part of the sales deceleration that this quarter was padded by, to your point, a lot of these very, very successful in -- successful to an unanticipated degree promotions that you had out there?","Donald R. Knauss","Well, I think -- go ahead, Steve.","Stephen M. Robb","Let me try the part of the gross margin piece, and then I'll turn it over to Don for the sales. On the gross margin, just a little more color on the quarter. We had about 140 basis point drag on gross margins tied to mix. 2\/3 of that is what Larry and Don just spoke to, which came out of our U.S. business, and about 1\/3 was country mix coming out of our International business, driven in part by Venezuela. If we look into, certainly the fourth quarter, we would expect the country mix is going to continue. But over time, that's going to get built into the base and it would start to dissipate. Some of the size mix is just a long-term trend as consumers trade up to larger value-oriented sizes. And to Don's point, we just need to take a look at pricing and other actions to address it. However, the piece that\u2019s related to merchandising that was so significant in the quarter, we just don't project that going forward. So mix will continue to be a drag on margins going forward but not at the levels that you're seeing in the third quarter.","Donald R. Knauss","Yes. I think, Chris, if you look at what we're thinking about for the fourth quarter, we obviously see margins while contracting nowhere near at the level we saw in this quarter, 180 dropping significantly into the 100 basis point range for next quarter and then, as Steve talked about, some modest increases in gross margin as we go forward. So I think, as I said, we'll continue to do 3 things here to really get ahead of this thing as we head into fiscal '13. One is we'll continue to drive the cost savings hard. Second, we'll really take a hard look at the pricing curves as we always do, and I think that's one of the reasons we've been successful with the pricing we've taken. And then third, you'll continue to see from us even more margin accretive innovation, and we'll continue to push that. If you look at just the last quarter, what's really helped, the Bleach Gel is off to a decent start; Liquid-Plumr Double Impact; Brita on-the-go bottle with new colors, new iterations. All those things are margin accretive to the company. And then obviously Burt's innovation is accretive to the company. So we'll continue to push those 3 things hard.","Lawrence S. Peiros","The other obvious negative factor is Venezuela, and we're certainly not blaming our results on Venezuela. But Venezuela did have a material impact on the Latin America business. We had significant volume losses as the whole regulatory environment sorts itself out. And over time, I think that will -- that impact may dissipate a bit.","Operator","And we will go next to Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Wanted to get underneath a little bit more of the top line expectations going forward and particularly around pricing. I think you guys mentioned earlier that they do expect some pricing to help you out next fiscal as well. But as you look at the, what do you call it, the pricing action sheet, I guess, you call it, all of it is -- there's very little new pricing. Right? So a lot of it was taken in August as we remember, some more recently. So what does that mean, I guess, in the context of what you were describing a little while ago? Does that mean you do anticipate taking a lot more pricing very much in line with the commodity expectations you're seeing or is it the pullback on some of the trade spend you've done more recently or something else?","Donald R. Knauss","So I think we do have obviously a pricing plan for next year. I would say it's not the same rate as it has been in fiscal '12, but we also have some carryover for fiscal -- from fiscal '12. So there's pricing we took in the second half of fiscal '12 that obviously will continue to impact FY '13. We also have some additional pricing actions that hadn't been announced this year that will impact fiscal '13. And in addition to that, we have some pricing actions that we'll take next year. So there is a fair amount of pricing but not at the level of what we're seeing this year. Trade spending is also an area. Trade spending is obviously both for building merchandising, as well as, to some extent, a pricing action. And we're also working rigorously in trying to reduce our trade spending next fiscal year, and that will be part of the overall margin equation.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And so from the top line guidance for next year, it's very evenly split between volume and price mix? Is that how we should think about it?","Stephen M. Robb","I think the way you should think about it, if you just step back, our outlook is 2% to 4% sales growth next year. It assumes that stepping back, our categories are going to be flat to up modestly. We are targeting about 3 points of innovation, which is kind of at the high end of the 2% to 3% range but certainly reflects the strength of what we've seen in innovation. We do expect pricing. But pricing, mix and these factors could add a point or take away a point depending on how things play out as we go through the year. And we'll have to get farther into the year before we can figure it out.","Donald R. Knauss","Ali, I would just clarify as well that the pricing document you're referencing, which is posted on our website, that only captures pricing actions that have been announced or actually implemented. So building off Larry's comments, I think as we go through the fiscal year, assuming we take those pricing actions, you'll begin to see those show up on that document.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Got you. No, I understood it's historical. Okay. And then the other thing is the success you've had with some of these sounds like promotions or merchandising events that you've [indiscernible] focused on the retailers. Why do you expect those to be left prevalent going forward? I mean, my experience -- our experience is when the retailers see something that actually drives traffic, they're going to come back to the well often. I mean, in some sense, you're in a position it looks like to drive that traffic. So how come that's a good thing and why do you think it -- actually it declined going forward?","Lawrence S. Peiros","Yes, again, these things are mixed blessings. And on one hand, we really like the volume that they generate. I think we continue to see -- to work to improve our offerings so that the margin hit is not quite as acute either by kind of sizing, restructuring the sizing of products or as we take price increases across certain brands and we try and lessen the discount curve, that the large sizes are a little bit less of a margin hit than they would be otherwise. So we're continuously working basically to improve the mix in terms of our pricing, in terms of our offering structural packaging or sizing, offering to improve that. But I do expect that large-size migration will continue over time, and we'll just have to deal with it.","Donald R. Knauss","And I think one of the other outliers in this quarter, Ali, was also the amount of charcoal that was moved in early because of the weather. No one obviously can predict the weather. It was a bit of an aberration this year how much of -- how improved the weather was. And of course, with daylight savings time, moving into early March, we got a lot of significant merchandising support. We hope certainly that, that merchandising support there and on the other brands continues, but that's in the base now too. So I think that's another point that you have to look at.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And just last potentially quick one, is the product geographic mix. You've already addressed it but just some clarity on why you actually think that, that becomes less of an issue going forward. I mean, do you expect that growth rates, for example, between geographies to start matching up a little bit or what is it that drives that? And maybe as a sub-part of that, is any of that Away From Home?","Stephen M. Robb","I'm sorry, Ali, can you clarify the question again?","Donald R. Knauss","Yes, I can't hear the first part of your question, Ali.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Oh, I apologize. The product and geographic mix that you said earlier on to one of the other questions would be less of an issue going forward because it gets into the base. Is that driven by a belief that the growth rate of the geographies or the products will match up going forward and, if so, why? And then the last thing I tacked on right at the end is, how much of that, if any, was driven by Away From Home on the product side?","Stephen M. Robb","So Ali, let me try to answer both pieces of the question. So first, we're talking country mix. Okay? That was the piece that we were referencing earlier. And I think, as we talked in the second quarter call, we're mentioning again our business in Venezuela has been down double digits. We're starting to see that in the second quarter of this fiscal. We've seen it again in the third quarter. At a certain point, it just becomes in the run rate of the business, and it's in the base. So as you think of country mix, certainly, as we look at Q4, in early '13, it\u2019ll continue to be a drag. But after a certain point, the consumer will adjust to the new lower pricing, will adjust to the new pricing. It will be reflected in the base, and that was the comment there. As far as the Away From Home business, I don't think we made any comments on that and that's certainly not having a negative impact on our business.","Donald R. Knauss","I think just to be clear on Venezuela, one of the reasons we think it obviously will start to improve is the new pricing protocols went in place April 1. There's obviously been a lot of working through those regulations during the month of April. The stickering of products actually started yesterday, May 1, so we're finally getting the new pricing on the shelf. So clearly, consumers -- first of all, retailers, and then consumers have really been out of the market, and that's why we saw such a dramatic volume shortfall in the quarter.","Operator","And we will go next to Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Sorry for getting again into this mix issue. Because, as far as I know, it is the largest swing that you have at least in 8 years. So that's why I am pretty interested in it. And certainly, you have flat country but -- country mix, but it's only 50% of your sales are in -- outside North America. So the issue is more about the package mix it seems like. And I would like to understand better from what you said, is this really package mix or trade spending? Because it seems like as if you are moving volume through larger packaging, it's basically canceling out all the pricing that you're also trying to take. So to what extent is either this should be trade spending and, therefore, we shouldn't be seeing this 250 basis points in pricing in terms of the accounting of your gross margin drivers or this is really that the pricing architecture of your packaging is so slanted toward discounting volumes that this is a distortion that, as Ali said, we are going to continue seeing going forward then?","Lawrence S. Peiros","So let me try and clarify and trade spending was up slightly in the quarter, but the rate of spending was not materially different than it was a year ago. So this is not a big trade issue, this is really more of a larger size issue. And quite frankly, we have some retailers, particularly in Charcoal, they're spending a lot of their own money to get consumers in their stores. I mean, the best example would be in the home hardware channel where you see -- this is out in the public space, you see very large retailers discounting Charcoal very heavily. That's not discounting that we're paying for, that's discounting that they're doing on their own to bring people into their stores to buy drill sets and other things that have much higher price points. So it really is more of a large size phenomenon. It's not us spending a lot more in terms of trade spending or certainly not us spending disproportionately by channel or by customer.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Does it mean that your -- the pricing architecture, that basically the volume discount that you're giving to the larger package needs to be corrected because you are basically canceling out the price increases that you're taking?","Lawrence S. Peiros","So we're separating out the impact of mix versus pricing. Right? So if you looked at our gross margin results, you'll see a positive impact from pricing. And then separate from that, you'll see a mix impact.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Precisely.","Lawrence S. Peiros","We're categorizing them differently, so we are getting a distinct benefit from pricing apart from the mix issue.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","But precisely. Because the negative mix is such, could it be that you should be taking prices up also in the larger packages so that you don't create this huge incentive that cancel out whatever you're trying to do with the price increases?","Donald R. Knauss","Javier, I think you're making too much out of one quarter and inferring that, that is the pricing protocol that incurs on these brands. If that were true the last quarter, we would have seen the same kind of trend. I think this is unique to the January, February, March quarter and the merchandising events. A lot of it is twin pack charcoal, for example. That really accelerated in the quarter because of the warm weather. Some of it is double and triple pack on Clorox Disinfecting Wipes. Those pricing curves have been adjusted over time. It's more about the strength and uniqueness in some of the merchandising events that went on in January, February, March. It's not really about something systemic with the pricing curves on the brands or it would have manifested itself in the other quarters as well.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","But the change that you did in gross margin for fiscal 2012 is all attributable to the swing in the third quarter or you are also lowering your internal plan for the fourth quarter gross margin? Because basically, you also -- you basically said, pricing is better than expected. Commodities are trending exactly as they -- as you forecasted. So basically, that gross margin starts going down again versus your own forecast. So basically, is the delta in forecast for the gross margin purely attributable to the third quarter or also the fourth quarter gross margin are worse than you thought it would be back in January when you provided guidance?","Stephen M. Robb","So Javier, this is Steve Robb. Let me see if I can clarify. We have, as you mentioned, lowered our gross margin outlook for the full year to 125 to 150 basis points of decline. It really reflects 2 things. One, fiscal year to date, the compression we've seen in gross margin, driven in part by the third quarter gross margin and mix issues that we've already articulated. But it's also negative country mix for reasons that we've previously discussed that will come through in the fourth quarter. So we are lowering the fourth quarter gross margin. At one point, we thought it would be flat to up somewhat. Now we believe the fourth quarter gross margin will be down and, for the full year, will be down 125 to 150 basis points.","Operator","And we will go next to Connie Maneaty with BMO.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Could you give us just some clarity on how much the IT spending is weighing on margins in your International segment?","Stephen M. Robb","Yes. The -- it is affecting it. I think we've talked about this before. Our International segment profitability was down about 49%. If you just step back and look at that, there's really 3 big things: first, is the investments we're making in systems and infrastructure. There's probably about 25% of that. There's about 25% of that, that is probably related to Venezuela and some of the unfavorable country mix. The balance is just incremental investments that we're making in the business to drive demand growth, as well as other inflationary pressures.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. I think you also mentioned that internationally, you were growing in lower-margin countries. Which would those be? I mean, Canada, New Zealand and Australia, I think you said your share was down.","Stephen M. Robb","Yes, I think we pointed to country mix. And again, I think the biggest single contributor to the unfavorable country mix is the expansion of the price control laws and how that's impacting us in Venezuela.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. So with your prices in Venezuela down but inflation still running about 25%, what do you estimate the either margin impact or EPS impact will be going forward?","Stephen M. Robb","Yes, I don't think we're going to provide the EPS outlook. Let me say this, just to keep this in balance. Venezuela, obviously, is an important business for us and certainly for our International business. But it represents less than 2% of our sales and something less than that in terms of the profit to the business. So obviously, it's had a modest drag on the top line growth for International. The margins are being compressed, and they will continue to be compressed for a few more quarters as we work through the pricing. And certainly, that will drag on next year's earnings per share, but it's not the biggest factor of all of the things that we're looking at.","Operator","And we will hear next from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So first, I really sort of don't want to talk about mix anymore, but I do recall mix being a negative surprise in each of the last 2 quarters from a combination, in fact, of country mix and pack size. So I would think that part of the looking forward is that you do start to lap some of this shift towards higher -- towards, sorry, larger sizes, as well as the geographic piece. So this quarter was outsized, but this is not a new phenomenon just looking back at my notes from the last 6 months of Clorox calls. Correct?","Stephen M. Robb","That's correct. This is not a new phenomenon. We fully expect that mix will continue to be a drag on margins as the consumer continues to shift to larger sizes, channel mix, things we've discussed. The things that we think will get better over time is the country mix, as we've talked and as Don had mentioned and Larry has talked to. The promotional aspect in the third quarter, we just wouldn't ask people to project it forward. So we do expect mix to be negative but certainly not at the levels that we saw in the third quarter.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then as I recall also in the first quarter of 2012, Charcoal, the result, sort of similar, like big retailer co-promotions in the first quarter. So you also have that as a comparison when we get into fiscal '13, so it's kind of 2 quarters of big Charcoal numbers.","Donald R. Knauss","Yes. That's correct, Lauren.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Then just focusing on a different segment, Lifestyle. So pricing -- price mix was very positive, much more than we had expected. So can you talk a little bit about that. Is kind of 6% pricing the run rate we should be thinking of? Was there some favorable mix in there? And then in terms of gud, I just wanted to refresh my memory if it was on store shelves, if that was December or if it came in this quarter and where you stand kind of on distribution and then also retail takeaway?","Stephen M. Robb","Okay. Lauren, just to clarify, the 6-point delta between volume and sales, probably around 4 points of that was pricing. The rest was a combination of favorable mix and favorable trade.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Great.","Donald R. Knauss","Larry, do you want to talk to gud?","Lawrence S. Peiros","So gud was on the store shelves last quarter. We're feeling very good about the progress relative to our expectations. So it's a solid incremental additive in our Burt's Bees line. And thus far, we're tracking with our objectives. We did get some early distribution in one of the big retailers. Some of the other retailers picked it up a little bit later in the quarter, but we are pretty close to what we think our regional level of distribution should be.","Donald R. Knauss","Lauren, I don't know if you saw, this is an aside, but one of the things we're using to try and leverage gud as well, last week, SELF Magazine did a survey and they evaluated 1,300 beauty care products. About half a dozen of them were showcased on The View last week. gud shampoo and gud conditioner won independently in that survey, so they were like 2 of the 6 or 8 products profiled on The View last week. So we're leveraging that. But clearly, these products are starting to resonate with people.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Great. And just on that -- the split between price and then mix and positive trade. Just thinking forward, so the -- are the mix and positive trade something we should be thinking about as continuing for Lifestyle or really focus more on the pricing piece and how that flows through future quarters?","Lawrence S. Peiros","Lauren, the impact wasn't so great as to -- I wouldn't describe it as a big swing factor going forward. I think mix in that segment will probably trend a little bit more favorably because you've got a lot of positive innovation coming out in those businesses. Don mentioned Brita. gud certainly helps, and we've got a number of new items coming out in the Food business as well. But the swing wasn't that dramatic to where I would focus on it too greatly.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then also on the acquisition, so it was about $22 million in the quarter kind of backing into it. Is that a good run rate to be using forward?","Stephen M. Robb","We think that it will contribute about 0.5 point to growth this fiscal year, fiscal '12. For fiscal '13, it's about a point of growth for the company. And just speaking to the acquisitions, what we would say is, well, it's early days. Certainly, the businesses are performing well and meeting our expectations. The integration is also going well, and so early signs are very positive.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right, great. And then just really final, was -- can you guys share how much of the IT and R&D spending investment happened this quarter?","Stephen M. Robb","I don't think we're releasing that level of specificity. What I would say is that we are still very much on track with both of those projects and anticipate spending $50 million to $55 million on the year, but probably on the low end of that this fiscal year. And our spending is trending consistent with what you would expect to see this far through the fiscal year.","Operator","And we will go next to Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Would you describe the current environment we\u2019re in as highly volatile? The reason I ask is that there's a pretty wide delta now with only a quarter left in terms of the earnings guidance. I think it's still sort of $0.10 with 2 months to go.","Stephen M. Robb","Bill, this is Steve. I would also just remind folks that $0.01 of earnings per share for Clorox is about $2 million pretax. So it's actually because of the share repurchases we've done over the years that it's not that much. So there's a lot that happens. The fourth quarter is the biggest quarter of our year. And we'll have to see how it plays through. But just in absolute profit relative to the sales, it's not that large.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And you discussed that the range for '13 in the guidance is only $0.15. You know what I mean?","Stephen M. Robb","Sure enough.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just in terms of the commodity inflation, can you just talk a little bit more specifically about what commodities we should continue to watch and kind of where you're seeing the inflation? Because I know it's kind of puts and takes, but some are coming down and some are going up. And then maybe even some more color on what's driving some of that supply chain inflation that you also said, I think, was 100 basis points.","Stephen M. Robb","Yes, so the commodities to continue to watch, which some are coming down, by the way, that is not what we've been seeing in the commodities that we're purchasing. Generally, what we've been seeing is a slow, steady march upward in commodity costs. Resin, obviously, is one that we're going to continue to focus on and watch pretty carefully, obviously, linerboard, chemicals and some of the agricultural commodities. What we saw this year was kind of, let's call it, high-single digit commodity cost increases. I think next year, we expect it to go up but at a more moderate rate. Maybe about half that rate is what we're focused on. And again, in terms of the other inflationary pressures affecting the supply chain, diesel continues to be one that we're watching very carefully. And then just the rising cost for health care, rising cost for wage inflation, these kinds of things.","Donald R. Knauss","Bill, that other inflation, about 40% of that is in international markets, and most of that is due to the labor inflation in high inflationary countries just trying to keep up with salary.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got you. That's helpful. And can I ask just one more, why do you think your categories are coming back so much faster than some of the other categories we see in the U.S.?","Donald R. Knauss","I think a good chunk of it, Bill, is due to innovation. I think one of the things we learned in the last 2.5 years is if you try and -- if you couple your price increases with innovation, it certainly helps. So I think if you look at our categories, there's been fairly significant innovation. If you look at the trash category, for example, that 2 years ago, 1.5 years ago, was declining 10%. Now it's up 4% or 5%. And if you look at things like OdorShield, Febreze, if you look at the Home Care category, we're starting to come back. You see Bleach Foamer, a number of innovations by us and competitors. I think a lot of it is tied to innovation.","Operator","And we'll go next to John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'm a little surprised that so far in, the mix issue hasn't come up here. So I have about 3 or 4 questions I'd like to ask on that.","Donald R. Knauss","Go for it.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Actually, I want to talk a little bit about the longer-term outlook on the cost saves side. So you guys have talked particularly about sort of how you've got these plans sort of 3, 4 years out. And I just want to get some ideas now in terms of what your range is there because it seems like we're a couple of years into sort of this last big push. And do you think you still have that longer-term visibility on the cost saves?","Stephen M. Robb","Short answer is, yes. John, I think as I've mentioned to you before, if you're in this for 7 to 10 years, that we're going to run out of cost savings ideas, and we have yet to run out. This year, fiscal '12, we're still targeting to deliver $90 million to $100 million of cost savings, probably at the high end of that range this fiscal. Next year, we are very much on track to deliver 150 basis points of productivity. And again, I think what separates the program and how we look at it is we do have a 3-year pipeline in cost savings ideas, and we also look at every line of the P&L. We do not limit this to just looking at manufacturing and raw material cost. We look at every line of the P&L and challenge ourselves to be more productive. And when you look at that, you're dealing with $4 billion of addressable spend. And when you take those kinds of numbers and ask to get a couple of points of productivity, we\u2019re changing technology as new processes come to market, we've been able to do this pretty consistently. And so at this point, certainly for fiscal '13, we feel very good about our cost savings programs and anticipate delivering about 150 basis points of productivity from that.","Lawrence S. Peiros","And over the longer term, our SAP implementation in Latin America should benefit us immensely on the cost savings side. Now that probably won't start to kick in until fiscal '14 and fiscal '15. But if we look back at how much SAP changed our U.S. business, I think we can even hit potentially more dramatic savings in Latin America given that we haven't had the kind of system capability in Latin America that we had historically in the U.S So that's a big platform of opportunity, not the only platform of opportunity in cost savings, but one big new platform over the longer term.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then, Steve, I guess going back to your comment there. Does that mean we should start seeing more leverage on the selling and admin line maybe as opposed to just on the -- and do we have to start figuring out the impact there as opposed to just strictly sort of a COGS standpoint?","Stephen M. Robb","Yes. Over the long term, you will see us focus on every line of the P&L. One of the things I think we've talked about in selling and admin is it's about 15% as a percentage of sales, certainly for this year and a similar amount next year. That is above the historical average, in part because of the infrastructure investments. But we are going to challenge ourselves over a multi-year basis to bring the selling and admin back in line with kind of the historical averages. And that\u2019ll be through a combination of anniversary-ing some of the infrastructure investments, as well as just continuing to challenge ourselves to be productive on every single line of the P&L.","Operator","And this concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Knauss, I would now like to turn the program back to you.","Donald R. Knauss","Well, thanks, everyone, for participating on the call, and we\u2019ll look forward to updating you on the last quarter of the year in August.

Management believes that providing insights on these measures enable investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations.","Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available on our website as well as in our SEC filings. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release.","Please also recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcome could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. I'd also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to the tax legislation impact.","Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The Company undertakes no obligations to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.","I'll start by covering our Q3 topline, discussing highlights in each one of our segments. Kevin will then address our financial results and outlook. And finally, we'll turn it over to Benno to provide his perspective, and then close with Q&A.","For the total company, Q3 sales grew 2%, reflecting about 3 points of benefit from the Nutranext acquisition, offset by about 3 points of unfavorable foreign currency impact due mainly to the devaluation of the Argentine peso.","Sales growth also reflects the benefit of price increases across nearly 50% of our global portfolio. Overall, our pricing plans have played out in line with our expectations with the exception of Glad which I will address shortly. Like we\u2019ve always said, cost justified pricing provides the fuel necessary to reinvest in the brands, which helps drive category growth.","Not only are we seeing share growth in majority of the brands that we took pricing in FY 2019, we\u2019re also seeing category improvement in those areas. I'll now go through our results by segment. In our Cleaning segment, Q3 sales decreased by 1% with growth in Home Care, offset by declines in Laundry and Professional P roducts.","Segment sales reflect more than 2 points of headwinds from the substantial difference in the degree of severity of the cold and flu season between this year and last year. This drove lower sales in our disinfecting products, most notably in the wipes and professional products businesses. Home Care grew sales benefiting from double-digit increases for a number of Clorox-branded products and continued success with innovation.","Sales of our Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, however, were down this quarter, driven mainly by the significantly milder cold and flu season. For perspective, Wipes category volume declined mid-single digits during the peak cold and flu months this year when it grew strong-double digits during the same period last year, a period classified by the CDC as high severity across all age groups.","The Wipes sales decline was also driven by heightened promotional spending by our competitors. This business has enjoyed growth rates in the high-single digits to double digits in the past 10 years with market shares well over 50% for multiple years. With this level of growth, we expect competition to be intense, leading to short-term variability in topline from time-to-time.","Over the last decade, we've had periods where we've lost or regained distributions, seen aggressive and dial back promotional spending, and we've seen competitors enter and exit the category. The bottom line is that we believe in the superior value proposition of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes and our strong innovation platform, and we're confident that we have the right plans to both address short-term competitive headwinds and drive profitable growth for our brand and the category in the long run.","The rest of the Home Care portfolio remains strong with recent pricing actions on track. Sales decreased in our Professional Products business, which was also affected significantly by the milder cold and flu season this year. With illness rates down 27%, hospitalization rates were down 48% as well according to the CDC creating lower demand for products used to clean and disinfect a room after a patient\u2019s day. We believe this is a temporary phenomenon isolated to this quarter.","Lastly, within the Cleaning segment, our Laundry business sales declined behind lower volume, partially offset by pricing. Importantly, Clorox Liquid Bleach continued to grow share reaching a five-year high at the end of this quarter, driven mainly by consumers\u2019 continue trade up to our premium Splash-less bleach.","Turning to Household segment. Q3 sales decreased by 1%, primarily from declines in Bags and Wraps, which were partially offset by gains in Cat Litter and Charcoal. In Bags and Wraps, sales and shares declined due to lower shipments driven mainly by widened price gaps in the business as well as distribution losses in select portions of the portfolio.","Since we took a price increase about eight months ago, the resin environment has changed, not only did our competitors not follow, we\u2019ve also seen a higher promotional spending in the category. As a result, we're doing the following things. First, we are increasing our trade investments to narrow the price gap, and the benefit of those initial investments are expected to be reflected on shelf by Q4.","Consistent with what we've seen historically, competitive spending tends to increase when input costs fall. We fully expect this competitive environment to continue at least in the near term. Therefore, we're also assessing other ways to further address the price gaps.","Finally, providing superior value remains a focus for us, and our long-term plans will continue to be centered around growing profitably and expanding the category through a robust innovation plan behind proprietary technology and capabilities.","Charcoal grew sales in Q3 by pricing and favorable mix. While it's still early, retailer support behind our plans have been strong out of the gate, and the reception of our Kingsford 100% Natural Hardwood Briquettes innovation has been positive. Now, we need to keep executing against our plan for the grilling season, which includes new advertising, packaging upgrades, and innovation.","We will also continue to partner with our retailers to aggressively put merchandising programs in place and extend the grilling season. Our focus ultimately is on retaining our loyal consumers and engaging new ones, including millennials to drive household penetration for the Kingsford brand and grow the category.","Our Cat Litter business grew sales on top of strong double-digit growth in the year-ago quarter with very strong performance in non-tracked channel. Our Fresh Step brand improved sales broadly across multiple channels, driven by the continued success of our Clean Paws innovation platform, including newly launched scents. The brand also recorded its twelfth consecutive quarter of share growth. With this momentum, we continue to feel confident about the growth trajectory of the business.","In RenewLife, sales were down slightly behind an overall category decline. We remain excited about the long-term potential of Digestive Health and RenewLife products, which were rated the number one probiotic brand and consumer satisfaction in 2018 by consumerlab.com. Our focus continues to be on restoring growth in this business.","In our Lifestyle segment, sales grew 23% reflecting about 21 points of benefit from the Nutranext acquisition. The one-year anniversary of the acquisition was April 2 and our integration is on track. Our focus in this business is on our strategic brands, which represent about 80% of sales and have higher margins and strong tailwinds while thoughtfully managing our non-core brands in order to drive scale and maximize profitable growth for the company.","Burt's Bees recorded another quarter of very strong sales growth despite price increases on a portion of the portfolio. Lip Care had another quarter of double-digit sales growth, which has accomplished in the five of the past six quarters and at least 17th consecutive quarter of sales growth. This growth was driven by ongoing strength of the brand's flagship products. Burt's Bees Beeswax Lip Balm, which was number one in the overall Lip Balm category for the last five weeks in tracked channel.","Consumption in Face Care was also up strongly behind it's new newly relaunched sensitive skincare line as well as face mask and towelette innovation, supported by continued strong brand investments and merchandising activities.","Brita gross sales for the first consecutive quarter we had successful innovation as well as continued momentum in the fastest growing channel e-commerce. We're also encouraged to see share trends continue to improve in all channels. While it's still early we've seen positive retailer and consumer response to the new Brita premium filtering water bottle the brand's latest product innovation.","Food sales decreased slightly in Q3, behind lower category consumption driven mainly by the shift in merchandising timing for the Easter Holiday, which fell in Q4 this year instead of in Q3. The fundamentals of this business remain strong with the hidden value brand, continuing to grow market share and our ready-to-eat dips innovation off to a great start.","Finally, turning to our International segment. Sales decreased 5% as the benefit of price increases and volume growth were more than offset by about 18 points of unfavorable foreign currency impact. We feel good about the progress of our Go Lean strategy, which has allowed us not only to substantially offset considerable FX headwinds, but also to improve the profitability of this segment.","Importantly, it has allowed us to invest in selected parts of the portfolio that have strong tailwinds and high margins. And we're starting to see the strategy bear fruit, such as in Asia where we've had double-digit sales growth for two consecutive quarters.","Now, I will turn it over to Kevin, who will discuss our third quarter financial performance and outlook for fiscal year 2019.","Kevin Jacobsen","Thank you, Lisah. And thank you everyone for joining us today. We delivered another quarter of sales and earnings growth and as expected gross margin expansion. As you saw in our press release, we've updated our fiscal outlook, which I'll discuss in a moment.","Turning to our financial results for the third quarter. Sales grew 2%, which included about three points of contribution from the Nutranext acquisition, partially offset by about three points of negative impact from the unfavorable foreign currencies, primarily from the devaluation of the Argentine peso.","Gross margin for the quarter came in at 43.4%, an increase of 60 basis points compared to 42.8% in the year-ago quarter. Third quarter gross margin included the benefit of 240 basis points from pricing and 170 basis points from cost savings. These factors were partially offset by a 190 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs 70 basis points from unfavorable foreign currency and 50 basis points of higher commodity costs. More perspective, our International business contributed more than half the pricing benefit to gross margin.","Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales came in at 13.9% versus 13.7% in the year-ago quarter, reflecting Nutranext integration expenses. Advertising and sales promotion investment levels as a percentage of sales came in at about 10%. We're spending for our U.S. retail business coming in over a 11% for the quarter.","Our third quarter effective tax rate came in at about 22% versus about 26% in the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by the benefit of U.S. tax reform. Net of these factors, we delivered diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.44 versus $1.37 in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 5%.","Turning to year-to-date cash flow as we noted in our press release, net cash provided by continuing operations was $603 million versus $576 million in the year-ago period.","Turning to our outlook. We have updated our fiscal year outlook to reflect two changes, our assumption for sales and our tax rate. Our fiscal year sales outlook is now expected to be in the range of 2% to 3% primarily driven by a significantly milder cold and flu season versus year-ago and heightened competitive activity impacting the Disinfecting Wipes category.","In addition, our updated sales outlook reflects lower sales in our Bags and Wraps business related to competitor reaction to the price increase we implemented when we had anticipated a continuation of elevated resin costs.","As Lisah mentioned, as resin prices subsided competition did not follow Glad\u2019s price increases. They stepped up their promotional spending resulting in the widening price gaps we are now seeing on shelf. Our sales outlook also continues to anticipate about three points of negative impact from unfavorable foreign currencies, primarily from the devaluation of the Argentine peso. As well as about three points of net benefit from the Nutranext acquisition and the AppleCare divestiture.","And as we mentioned in our press release, our fiscal year sales outlook continues to assume about three points of incremental sales from innovation program. Other assumptions for our fiscal outlook remain the same include fiscal year gross margins at about flat, advertising and sales motion spending at about 10% of sales, which continues to reflect higher investment levels in the back half of the fiscal year.","Selling and administrative expenses at about 14% of sales, EBIT margin to be down and free cash flow at 11% to 13% of sales. As I mentioned, we've updated our assumption for the fiscal year tax rate, which is now in the range of 20% to 21%.","Net of all these factors, we now expect fiscal year diluted EPS to be in the range of $625 to $635, primarily reflecting the benefit of lower fiscal year tax rate, offset by a bit assumption for fiscal year sales. Our fiscal year diluted EPS continues to reflect our estimate of $0.08 to $0.12 of EPS dilution from the Nutranext acquisition in addition to $0.05 to $0.07 of negative impact from tariffs affecting a couple of our business units.","In closing, I believe we are largely executing well against our key strategic priorities, including pricing with the exception of Glad. We're actively working to address this. At the same time, we feel good, then the last two quarters, many of the brands that pricing continue to grow share. In addition, as Lisah mentioned, we are also seeing improvement in those categories. We are also pleased that pricing contributed to another quarter of gross margin expansion, giving us fuel needed to continue supporting our brands and categories.","Moving forward, we are addressing the following immediate priorities and have stepped up our investments accordingly. First, we're addressing the widened price gaps and heightened competitive promotional spending in the Bags and Wraps category. Second, we're addressing heightened competitive promotional spending and the Disinfecting Wipes category.","Additionally, we do anticipate competitive promotional spending in these categories to continue. While our experience demonstrated the promotional spending does not result in sustained category growth, we are prepared to increase own spending in the near-term. We remain committed to investing strongly to support the long-term health of our brands.","And with that, I will turn it over to Benno.","Benno Dorer","Thanks, Kevin, and thanks everybody for being on the call. I'll start by emphasizing the Clorox remains dedicated to good growth. Growth that's profitable, sustainable and responsible for our company shareholders and retail partners. Our approach to good growth is to invest strongly in our purpose driven brands to deliver superior value beyond industry-leading innovation and strong consumer engagement online, execute pricing and cost savings plans to offset cost pressures and pursue mergers and acquisitions thoughtfully to evolve our portfolio over time.","With this in mind, here are the three important takeaways from today's call. First, Clorox's executing well overall against the strategic priorities we set at the start of the fiscal year. We continue to invest strongly in our brands, our multi-year innovation platforms including Clorox Scentiva and Fresh Step Clean Paws continue to perform well.","Burt's Bees strong third quarter sales were supported by innovation in Face Care and while early. We are encouraged by the initial results of our latest innovations, including new Kingsford a 100% Natural Hardwood Briquettes, Hidden Valley Ready-to-Eat Dips, and the Brita Filtering Water Bottle. And we are seeing sustained momentum in ecommerce across a number of brands.","We continue to expect this channel to be about 8% of company sales this fiscal year. As we had planned for the second half of fiscal 2019, we invested strongly in advertising and sales promotion in our third quarter with investment levels at more than 11% of sales for our U.S. retail business to continue driving awareness and trial behind innovation and to support the long-term health of our brands.","We continue to be pleased about our acquisition of Nutranext, which recently reached the one-year mark of joining the Clorox family. We're certainly pleased about the businesses contribution to total company sales and our integration work remains on track. We delivered another quarter of gross margin expansion.","Good growth means we're focused on profitable growth versus growth at all cost. We\u2019re pleased that our pricing actions in the U.S. and international as well as our agile enterprise and cost savings programs contributed to gross margin results.","Apart from Glad, we're seeing pricing resilience in many parts of our portfolio with continued market share growth in six of nine brands that took pricing, including Clorox bleach, sprays and toilet cleaning products, Fresh Step cat litter, Hidden Valley dressings, and Burt's Bees products.","Lastly, we feel very good about the strong progress we are seeing in our international business with continued strong topline momentum in several categories and countries, including two consecutive quarters of double-digit sales growth in Asia. What's more, in the face of significant FX headwinds, our Go Lean Strategy focusing on pricing and cost savings has delivered five consecutive quarters of profit growth.","My second message for today is we are aggressively addressing the challenges in the Bags and Wraps and Disinfecting Wipes categories. As Lisa and Kevin mentioned, we're charging ahead with increased investments to address the challenges in these two categories. We have been through this before, and we have a strong track record of getting businesses back to growth. We demonstrated this on the Litter and Brita businesses recently and while early, we are encouraged by the initial progress on Charcoal in the third quarter.","Finally, my last point is this, we manage our business for the long-term. As we address the challenges we're facing, our priority remains investing in the long-term health of our brands. Longer term, we anticipate continuing to face elevated competitive spending in select categories make it our pursuit of good growth, more challenging, at least in the near-term. We will be prepared to increase our demand building investments to create superior value and support the long-term health of our brands behind the successor to our 2020 strategy. It's a strategy we're excited to share with you in the fall.","What I can tell you now is that our updated strategy will include the key elements we believe are critical for continuing to deliver good growth, investing strongly to innovate how we build our brands with proven and new capabilities, which will help us win in the marketplace, transforming the way we work, including leveraging technology to drive competitive advantage, so that we evolve into an even leaner and faster enterprise. And continuing our commitments to be a mission-driven business as a means to support long-term value creation for all our stakeholders.","Operator, you may now open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Dorer. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","Great. Thanks. I just had some questions on the Nutranext business. So margins in Lifestyle were really weak this quarter. The press release mentioned a couple things like manufacturing and logistics and tariffs, but the ongoing investments to support Nutranext is kind of what stood out to me, so if you could share a little bit of context on what that may or may not have been related to.","And then on top of that, I think last quarter, your inventory was up significantly and it was again the case this quarter. So, I was wondering if there was anything related to the margin performance, and Nutranext tied up in that inventory conversation as well. Thanks.","Kevin Jacobsen","Good morning, Lauren. This is Kevin, and let me start talking about margin in Lifestyle. What I'd say overall is we continue to feel very good about Nutranext. I think as I've mentioned in the past, we fully expect it to be margin accretive to the company. If you look at our specific results in Q3, I'd highlight a few items in the Lifestyle segment.","The first is, and I think you're aware of this, we have the ongoing headwinds from tariffs that are impacting our Brita business unit and that's having a drag on overall profitability. In addition to that I would say two other items, we are leaning into Burt\u2019s advertising, our commitment was as we're taking pricing to recover costs, we would invest that back into the business, and we've done that. And one of the areas we focused on in the third quarter was Burt\u2019s behind our relaunch that Lisa mentioned. So we feel really good about the money we're putting behind the Burt's equity.","And then lastly, we've got some integration expenses for Nutranext that continue, and that\u2019s been going on for about 12 months now, and so we continue to integrate that business. But overall, regarding Nutranext, I feel very good about the ongoing profitability of that business.","Lauren Lieberman","And on the days inventory piece, Kevin.","Kevin Jacobsen","Yes, no real change there. It's pretty consistent to what I mentioned last quarter, we were up about $48 million year-over-year at the end of Q3, $46 million was Nutranext, so the base business was essentially flat year-over-year and that was my commitment. Last quarter, we\u2019d worked down the higher inventory as we launched our innovation. We had pre-built some innovation.","And as I also mentioned, if you think about Nutranext, it's a relatively small business we've acquired, it was not particularly efficient when we bought it. Their days on hand probably operate in the 120 to 130 days. Clorox generally operates in the 50 to 60 days inventory on hand. So, there are some good work and some good opportunity for us to go through there and make that business more efficient.","It will not be our first priority. We're focused on innovation. We're focused on extending distribution, but we will improve the overall turns of that business, but the other comment I'd say is I never expected to be consistent with other parts of our portfolio. They tend to be very high turn items. I think the VMS space in general will be a little bit higher in inventory levels and days on hand because of the complexity, but certainly expect it to be lower than where it is right now.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay. Great. And then just separately, if I may, the conversation on Wipes, of course appreciate you guys being so forthright about that dynamics have changed for the moment in that category, but I was actually surprised by let's say how sharply you're talking about this even in the prepared remarks, it's sort of, from what we can see in scanning your report, it doesn't look nearly as severe as what you're starting to describe where you're kind of talking with the long-term track record.","And so, if you could offer a little bit more detail perhaps on what it is that you're seeing, I would have thought perhaps it was just things got a little more promotional because there was inventory out there, people didn't get that sick. Okay. More promotion to kind of move the category, but this sounds like something more sustained that you're worried about in kind of gearing up the site, so a little bit more context there would probably be pretty helpful.","Benno Dorer","I'll be happy to Lauren. I think we want to separate Q3 and then what we were expecting going forward. If you think about Q3, as Lisa mentioned, Wipes was down. To give a perspective, that was 1 point in headwind to the Company and 2 points of headwind for the Cleaning segment. And the majority of that was cold and flu, pretty mild cold and flu season this year compared to a very severe cold and flu season last year. Last year, according to several metrics and the CDC, it was the most severe cold and flu season since 2009 for perspective.","So the delta this year versus last year, pretty extreme, and that accounts for the majority of the weakness. Said that to a lesser extent in Q3, we did see an increase in competitive promotional spending certainly towards the end of the quarter, and we expect that to be continuing. So the cold and flu impact is certainly one-time, and hopefully will help next year if there is more average cold and flu season.","But the competitive promotional spending, we do expect that to be sticky and we will defend against it and spend against it mostly to strengthen our own merchandising planning in Q4 and beyond. So this is something that we've seen in the past. If you look at the past 10 years, we've been here before. Generally, we've had most years with very strong growth in Wipes, but we have had years in particular following particularly strong sales and share growth and we've certainly seen that on this business over the last few years, where we have seen a little bit of a correction, where competitors branded and private label, spend back in trade promotion to defend their own share.","So if you look at the last 10 years of share in Disinfecting Wipes, we've been as high as mid 50s, we've dropped back down to 47 in 2014, then back up to the mid 50s in 2018, and what you're seeing now it's dropped back in tracked channels below 50%. So, very consistent with what we are seeing every few years. It's a hotly contested category. We're the innovation leader. We\u2019re the spending leader. We have the superior equity. Our brand has seen as better in value.","So what that means is as competitors are under pressure they sometimes react with increased promotional spending, and that's what we're seeing now. We're applying the recipe that we've always applied, which is to defend short-term to make sure that competitors understand that this is not the way to grow this category, but then also to continue to drive our strengths long term the strengths certainly, our innovation and our brand equity building, advertising, and sales promotion.","To be clear, trading down in this category does not work for the category long term. So as you think about what retailers will see as this promotional support happens right now in the marketplace is that the category growth is easing up, and over time, what we've seen in the past is that the market gets back to rational behavior and driving the category the right way, which is through innovation and advertising and trading in consumers in ways that are sustainable.","So nutshell, not a new situation, something that happens periodically, something that certainly happens right now is resin costs has eased up a little bit, but it's something that we know how to deal with.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Strycula with UBS.","Steven Strycula","Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for the candid remarks. So with the updated guidance wanted some clarification on how we think about Q4. If I'm backing into it correctly, I think domestic sales were down almost about a half-point this quarter. So within your implied guidance, what kind of gets better in Q4 and does domestic business get back to call it a 1% or better growth rate? Thank you.","Kevin Jacobsen","Hi Steve. This is Kevin. And I'll take the question. As I'm sure, you\u2019re going to appreciate, we don't provide quarterly outlook. I\u2019ll speak to the full-year, but with nine months in the books, I assume you can back into this. We've updated our topline outlook. I would say there is no change in Nutranext and no change in the impact of FX, they're essentially equal and offsetting, and that leaves our base business growth rate about 2% to 3%. I think what that really highlight is as Benno mentioned, we did see the slowdown in Q3 specifically associated with cold and flu, that's transitory. I don't worry too much about that issue going forward.","But the challenge we have particularly in our Bags and Wraps business with the widened price gaps that's something we'll see not only in Q3, but will continue into Q4 as we work to address the price gap. So I would expect a portion of what we're seeing this quarter to carry forward next quarter, but I don't expect the impact of cold and flu to carry forward into the quarter, but will certainly impact the full-year.","Steven Strycula","And then a quick follow-up for Benno. On the Charcoal business, I was pleased to see that it sounds like the volumes grew. What's really driving that just given that the category was a little bit weaker last year from a market share perspective? Thanks. I'll pass it on.","Benno Dorer","Thanks, Steve. So feeling good about Q3, growth in sales came behind pricing and mix. We've certainly seen a strong retailer acceptance to our selling plans for the new grilling season which really kicks off this quarter. Pricing is also underway and on track and we expect the sell through to be complete during Q4. So a lot of the things that we talked about in the last quarter are working so far pricing in particular of course has given us the fuel to invest in this business, which has credibly important in particular, as it comes to driving household penetration by engaging millennials and by continuing to drive frequency of use through strong merchandising to create impulse purchases.","So encouraged by the return to strength in Q3 mainly behind retail engagement. Now what we need to see is that strong retail engagement and the expected strong merchandising plans flow through to the consumer hopefully also aided by a more normal weather compared to last fiscal year. So feel good where they stand. One quarter out of the gates. But the main grilling season is ahead of us and we're focused on engaging our consumer to keep growing the business in line with what we've come to expect over a number of years on Charcoal.","Lisah Burhan","Steve, for the record, solid sales growth for coal, but volume is down consistent with pricing.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo Securities.","Joseph Lachky","Hi. It\u2019s actually Joe Lachky calling in for Bonnie. So I wanted to ask about gross margins. So your fiscal 2019 guidance was flat implies Q4 gross margin will be up, but not as much as it was in Q3 and Q2, so I was kind of curious about the puts and takes there. And the reason for the slowdown in momentum and I know you have increased promos coming in and that's probably part of it.","And then longer term on gross margin, I know you won't give fiscal 2020 guidance until next quarter, but maybe if you could talk about your confidence in maintaining margin expansion into fiscal year 2020. For example, do you expect the pricing impact to continue to accelerate and how should we think about commodities and manufacturing and logistics going forward? Thanks.","Kevin Jacobsen","Thanks, Joe. Let me start with this fiscal year. I know you got a few questions here. As it relates to this fiscal year, if I think about flat for the year, we were down about 50 bps in the first half of the year, which would require us to be up about 50 bps in the back half of the year. In Q3, we saw we\u2019re up about 60, so pretty much in line with what I expected.","As I think about Q4, I think it's mostly playing out as we expected, although the one changes and you mentioned it, I do expect to see heightened trade spending would have a little bit of a negative effect on gross margin. So I still feel comfortable about flat is right, but importantly it will reflect three quarters in a row of margin expansion. And as we've talked about, that's incredibly important to us as we've taken pricing to get back to growing gross margins, it's allowing us to increase investments in the brands, which is how we create long-term value. So that model is working well for us and we are very much on track this year to do that.","In regard to fiscal year 2020. As you may know, we do not have a gross margin goal, we have EBIT margin goals of 25 to 50 bps and while I won't provide an outlook yet for 2020, we're in the process right now of finalizing our plans next year, but we remain committed to expanding EBIT margin 25 to 50 bps over time, but we'll get back to you in August and give you more details about fiscal year 2020.","Joseph Lachky","And then just one follow-up on pricing, and then I'll pass it along. I guess, are you planning on, I know you've taken pricing across the vast majority of our portfolio, already, but are you planning on taking any incremental pricing in the near-term, and specifically thinking international where your price mix hasn't been able to offset that severe FX headwinds the last few quarters. Thanks.","Kevin Jacobsen","Yes, I would say we've executed a tremendous amount of price internationally and in fact we haven't talked about it a lot, but if you look at our total pricing benefit of about 240 bps this quarter about two thirds of the pricing benefit we're generating from our international division, and they have done an excellent job executing pricing and it's resulting in improving profitability. If you've seen our results, I believe over the first three quarters of the year, we've grown profit about 12% internationally.","And importantly, we've returned to international gross margin expansion as well. So the pricing work internationally has been excellent and is delivering increased value very similar to the U.S. Every year, we will look at the markets and decide it was to appropriate take pricing based on inflation. We price towards the medium-term cost environment and so while we've executed quite a bit of pricing this year not prepared to discuss our pricing plans for fiscal year 2020 at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara, your line is open.","Dara Mohsenian","Hey guys, sorry about that. So I just wanted to parse through the Charcoal side of the business. It sounded like you performed pretty well in the quarter which surprised me because the track channel data looks off. So was that just stronger growth on the untracked side of the business were shipments ahead of retail sales, perhaps aided by the pipeline fill for the natural innovation, any clarity there would be helpful.","And then also just from a longer-term perspective, I was hoping for more of sort of a broader state of the union on Charcoal, A, the category itself, it looks like household penetration maybe decelerating a bit with the shift to pellet grilling, et cetera. Is that the case from the data you see are really not a big issue? And secondly, your market share performance in the track channels, it looks like it's weekend with the shift to some of the all-natural competitors. So any commentary there would be helpful again on household penetration and your market share performance. Thanks.","Benno Dorer","Yes. Dara, first of all, tractors is non-tracked as is the case across most of the businesses, non-tracked channel performance is stronger perspective. We grew volume across the total company last quarter at non-tracked channels and that's certainly also two for charcoal and remember that non-tracked channels account for 30% to 40% many of our businesses total sales. So it's pretty significant.","So pretty different performance there did not built any inventory beyond what we\u2019re seeing normally heading into the acrylic season. Certainly what we've talked about before. So, really what I have to say on charcoal is nothing new relative to what commented on in the last quarter. Last quarter, what we said is that we're focused on driving household penetration by reengaging millennials.","We're doing that by spending incremental dollars, the dollars that we're earning through price increases in target media for new advertising, through new graphics, through 100% hardwood innovation, which is off to a good start and we're also doing that by continuing to engage retailers to drive frequency of use, strong merchandising plans are critical to create impulse purchases because the charcoal purchase is often, an impulse purchase in store and displays work and we are engaging retailers to make sure we have strong plans in place as the grilling season kicks into high gear.","So nothing new other than that one quarter in against the plan that we talked about last quarter, we're feeling good about the progress that we're making in particular with retailers and we are focused on the same priorities one quarter at a time. And that's, that's the story in short on Charcoal.","Dara Mohsenian","Okay. And then Benno on the pricing front, just for a broader perspective, I guess the tone in the call and the comments around Wipes in trash bags stands out to bid in contrast to a very confident home, we heard from you guys, a couple of quarters back when you put the pricing plans into place.","So I'd just love the get sort of a post modem on any lessons learned around how you implement price increases with the competitive issues that have emerged in Wipes in trash bags. It's more just a couple of categories were competitive issues ramped up and it is what it is or is there sort of better ways to manage it going forward? Thanks.","Benno Dorer","Yes. So upfront, I would like to separate Wipes and trash bags and I want to reemphasize as did Kevin and Lisah before that the issue that we're dealing with in the short-term on Wipes is one of competitive promotional spend, but not related to pricing.","Okay. So let me unpack this a little bit. First of all, did we execute our plan on pricing? Yes, we did. About 50% of the portfolio mix of U.S. and international pass-through in line with expectations on all of the businesses. So, that's all good news and consistent with what we said in the past.","Second, is it working? Yes, it is working with one exception. That is not inconsistent with what we said in the past, we have talked about Glad and the emerging concerned the competitors did not follow in the last quarter and what we certainly see now is that they still haven't followed, but they also now started to spend back.","So that's one issue that we're dealing with, but other than that it's working. First of all, because of the gross margin expansion that you've seen them that have given us the fuel to invest in growth for the company, it's working because two-third of the categories where we took pricing up in share, it's working because the categories where we took pricing, post pricing are tending higher.","So, we are seeing stronger category growth, which means more money in the pockets for retailers and it's also working because price elasticities even though early post, the price increases, but the data that we have the vast majority of brands are stable or in some cases, even better than pre-pricing. So that checks off all the boxes that we've talked about in the past and it tells you that the Clorox Company knows how to take pricing.","Are we experiencing the bumpiness that with anticipated to you in the last few quarters where we've talked about pricing? Yes, we're seeing that. We're seeing that in particular on Glad and as Lisah and Kevin have said, we are addressing the wide price gaps there aggressively.","But other than that it's working, pricing still cost justified our analytics are showing that we can predict what's happening in the marketplace and beyond Glad, we're very confident at the success behind pricing and also confident that these price increases will be sustained in the marketplace.","Dara Mohsenian","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","Hey, good afternoon, folks. Thanks for spot me in. Two questions, first, a really quick one, the tax rate for the year, should we expect to sustain or should we be modeling the step-up into next year.","Benno Dorer","Hi Jason. Yes, thanks for the question on tax rate. As you saw our expectations this year 20% - 21%, I would say, driven by two items beyond the obvious benefit of tax reform. We've seen a much higher level of stock option exercise activity and you might recall, a number of years ago there is accounting change that provides excess tax benefits associated with stock option activity.","So, that is certainly impacting our results this year. We've also had a couple of settlements with some state and federal authorities and these tend to take years to resolve in the hard to predict, but we've had a couple of settlements that impacted our rate this year. So while we're enjoying a lower rate this year.","As you think about next year, I would encourage you think about a more normalized tax rate for us, if you think about a statutory federal rate of 21%, state rate of about 3%. I expect mid 20s ongoing. And so I've enjoyed the benefit this year. I don't expect to see either level of stock option exercise activity or the tax settlements that we had this year. And I think that will generate about 300 basis point increase in the rate next year, year-over-year.","Jason English","Thank you for that. My next questions on innovation, you certainly had some great success in the past couple of years and you've touted many initiatives on the call today. But when we grind through some of the data, it looks like maybe net innovations beginning to slow.","We're looking at Scentiva branded, and it's across all categories, it's slowed quite a bit with prior launches and things like bathroom cleaners, declining and kind of offsetting the gains in your new mop cloths, your new sulfur-type products and toilet ones and when we look across your aggregate portfolio, your total distribution points are declining solid mid-single digit clip suggest sort of SKU is sort of shrinking. Can you give us some color and context on what's happening in driving some of these metrics in that direction?","Benno Dorer","Yes, Jason, a lot to unpack. First of all, innovation on track overall feeling good about innovation both to longer-term platforms, you've mentioned one of them Scentiva \u2013 also clean pause and the PPT platforms, really good Scentiva the particular comment I would make is that what's great about \u2013 Scentiva is that it brings in new consumers into the franchise 70% of the purchases from new consumers.","So that tells you that we're continuing to feel good about the ability to attract new users with innovation. The more recent innovation from this back half, while early all feeling really encouraged whether that's Glad with its LeakGuard technology, which builds of the technology platform, with more than 40 patents and is off to a nice start Hidden Valley Ranch dips with three flavors essentially doubles. The access that we have on this brand to usage this occasions and feeling good about how that's doing out of the gates. We talked about Kingsport the premium filtering bottle is doing great.","Consumers are spending $15 billion on bottled water every year and the majority in home. So we feel good about the ability to attract consumers in home, but also out of home with this bottle especially because single use plastic continues to be under attack.","We talked about Burt's Bees lot of innovation in lip and face, including new Lip Balm flavors new face masks, towelettes and sensitive skin care relaunch which we've supported with TV and has led to really strong growth in the Face Care arena. And then Scentiva wet mopping costs of course as an entrance in the sizable convenient screen platforms.","So across-the-board feeling good overall certainly early but indications are all positive. I would perhaps separate that from the distribution comment that you made. First of all, I would remind everybody that again tracked channels only account for a portion of the business and that the business performance is much stronger non-tracked channels.","But as you unpack distribution, we're seeing some very some gains in some businesses like Brita and Cleaning and Cat Litter and we did see some losses in other businesses. And I would however perhaps tie those two the things that we're working with. First of all bumpiness post pricing, if you listen to our comments in the last few quarters, we have said that bumpiness post pricing can mean that retailers could react with lower distribution temporarily, that's something that we used to and something we've anticipated to you and something we know how to work through over time.","And we're also in the speed of driving growth, that's profitable, sustainable and responsible and we call this good growth. We're not afraid to accept distribution losses unless strategic parts of the portfolio, give you a few examples. And in Glad we've lost some distribution on trash behind the discontinuation of our quick tie business, which is lower tier trash, lower margin in order to continue to facilitate the trade up into the more profitable premium skews.","In food, what you have seen as a temporary discontinuation of skews, which will be replaced with innovation and make space for future growth. So this is not uncommon. We're remaining comfortable with where we are and if I look at our track record of building distribution overtime, I feel good. We do it the right way behind innovation. We do it because we are the leading investors in our category.","We do it behind customer capabilities, we are confident and we do it with SKUs, which overall tend to have a higher productivity on shelf than those of our competitors and retailers know this. So feeling good about where we are in-store and again would perhaps not high what you're seeing on distribution through innovation. We feel good about innovation portfolio.","Jason English","Got it. Thank you. Very helpful. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Your next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi.","Wendy Nicholson","Hi. I don't mean to beat a dead horse, but I guess my one question on the Glad Bags specifically is just one of the things we've heard today. As oh gosh, this is the death knell in the business. This means that private label has finally taken over and everybody's buying Solimo and not Glad.","So I guess obviously dramatic over reaction, but just what gives you confidence that I'll maybe that is not the case and maybe in terms of what you see in terms of non-track channel market shares, I mean, what gives you confidence that some pricing adjustments and trying to bring some new innovation to the category really is going to bring back growth in this isn't some sort of structural change in the category.","And to that point, I guess one of the things you had said a couple quarters ago or two quarters ago I think was that the stock what kind of rich in your view and you wouldn't be buying back much more stock at the current price, but what's your sentiment now where you're thinking now about share repurchases and not just looking at the stock today, but also reflecting your confidence in your outlook for the fourth quarter and thinking about 2020 is now a place where you think about stepping in and supporting the stock? Thanks.","Benno Dorer","Yes. Let\u2019s Kevin comment on stock repurchase would want to make it clear that we did not comment on that. We never do. We also certainly didn't comment or make comments that you talked about Wendy and your ingoing remarks on Glad Bags. What gives me confidence and I want to be clear, there is absolutely nothing in here that points to a structural change. The thing that gives me confidence is that we've been here before and we know how to manage this.","If you look back at the Glad business and I personally been involved in it Glad business for 16 years, what you're seeing is when resin falls and it's certainly come in lighter, over the last few months promotional dollars flow into the category. So that's what's happened. And what we've always done successfully is to defend against that and we have commented that that's what we're doing now.","What we've also seen is that competition has not followed through a price increase. Again, that's something that we have seen before and we know how to manage that. So this is tactical. This is a phenomenon like one that we have seen in the past and one that we know how to manage. And that's all there is.","And then Kevin can perhaps comment on repurchases.","Kevin Jacobsen","Sure Wendy. In regard to repurchases and maybe just to reconnect to our program. I think many you folks know we have authorization for up to $2 billion share repurchase program, the Board approved back in May. To date, I've execute about 9% that program returned about $178 million to shareholders.","And then specifically this year, if I think about total cash returns through the first nine months, we've returned about $675 million to shareholders. That\u2019s split pretty equally between dividends and share repurchases. And that's up about 75% versus the prior year, over the first nine months, really driven by both a significant dividend increase, we took last May of 14% plus we've stepped up share repurchases, both for open market and dilution management.","And then specific to Q3, we've returned about $200 million to shareholders about two-thirds of that is the dividend about a third share repurchases. We repurchased about $73 million and I sign that all dilution management. As I look forward, I won't comment on our actions going forward, but I will reaffirm that we have a very disciplined approach to how we'll execute the program.","There is no time limit on it and by design, it is not an ASR that gives us plenty of flexibility, but I am certainly committed to updating folks every quarter on our progress. But certainly won't share going forward in terms of the express criteria.","Wendy Nicholson","Both of those are very helpful. Thank you.","Benno Dorer","Thanks Wendy.","Operator","Next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.","Andrea Teixeira","Hi, thank you for squeezing me. So I have a follow-up on Nutranext from a topline perspective, I know you discussed a little bit on the margin side? What is the other line performance of the brand now that you've owned for about a year. In all math, it looks like your sales are growing only like low single-digits, I don\u2019t say to mid single-digit range. So wanted to double check on a like-for-like basis. And was that in line with your expectations going in and if you can talk about opportunities on potentially accelerating that growth going forward. And if you can layer that with the category challenges that your face with RenewLife is that also hurting Nutranext? Thank you.","Benno Dorer","Andrea, if you are good about Nutranext integration remains on track, which certainly has been our year one focus. Now we are in year two and integration, I would say is that a good part behind us feeling good about where the businesses, which includes topline growth.","Our focus is, first of all on expanding distribution and we're seeing that across Food, Drug, Mass and Club making really good progress. Our focus also is on starting to bring in innovation, we're launching on NeoCell one of our strategic brands, collagen protein peptides that is a fast growing category that combines two trends collagen and protein and innovation that we feel bullish about.","And then third, as you'd expect from us, we're also managing the portfolio differentially we've acquired seven brands, about 80% of those brands, we consider to be strategic. And we're investing heavily into the growth of this business and then about 20% is non-strategic and we manage that as a fuel business just like we do with other parts of our portfolio, outside Nutranext and that in turn generates profit for the strategic businesses.","So, Nutranext had a strong Q3. We like the business, we like where it's going. And we like how our team managed it and we're certainly committed to invest in the business and also not afraid to increase investments in the business. Should we feel like that's necessary. And we can certainly update you on our 20 plans in the next quarter.","As we have commented in the past you know Nutranext and RenewLife are separate businesses as far as some of the issues that hold RenewLife back temporarily now. So, we feel good about Nutranext and remain bullish on the growth that we're seeing on that business.","Andrea Teixeira","Thank you, Benno.","Benno Dorer","Thanks, Andrea.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge.","Jonathan Feeney","Good morning. Thanks very much. When I look across all your categories, I guess the flipside of Jason\u2019s question. Your dollar sales per total points of distribution are growing mid single-digit for the company as a whole with that loss for distribution. And it's really pretty consistent across categories, each of which seem to have their own dynamics, it seems pretty unlikely that every single bottoms up analytic would be pointing to that being the strategy.","So, I mean, is there some aspect of this. That's a thoughtful transfer of less hardworking measured retail points that might be losing traffic towards alternate channels that are generally gaining traffic like e-commerce, et cetera. And as part of that do you have, you mentioned analytics earlier Benno. Do you have when you lose distribution in somebody's places, particularly your larger categories. Do you have household usage data, loyalty data that gives you the confidence that these are maybe the right moves, particularly on the pricing side? Thank you.","Benno Dorer","Yes, again, first of all, just to have a differentiated point of view on distribution were growing distribution in some categories and we're not growing in some other categories. I like where you were going on dollar sales as a point of distribution that of course has a lot to do with two things.","First of all, pricing is working as we have commented. Second, simplification in the category, which sometimes means less distribution and our SKUs too, is a good strategy because in many categories shelves are over skewed in there too many brands that shelf and you know that doesn't necessarily help the consumer find what they want. As they spend a limited time in front of the shelves.","What we do find is that thoughtfully managing distribution unless strategic SKUs enough comment on that before on this call, is a good idea and I use Glad Trash as an example. We're eliminating very low margin, lower priced SKUs that don't add value to the category and don't add value to our brand is smart if it helps consumers trade into the right SKUs, which tend to be more profitable, which tend to be a higher price and which tend to grow the category for retailers.","So that's something that we do. That's something that we'd backup analytics both pre and post and something that we worked with our retailers on an ongoing basis. So at the end of the day, while I'd always in an ideal world like to gain distribution on all of our businesses, all the time, sometimes as it relates to bumpiness post pricing and as it relates to managing distribution thoughtfully and non-strategic businesses, it does lead to lower distribution on some of the businesses.","But again, in the long run, I feel good about where we stand, but feel good about the growth plans that we have with retailers and I feel good about our ability to continue our strong track record to grow distribution on businesses over time.","Jonathan Feeney","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein Research.","Ali Dibadj","Hey guys. So, I guess I still want to get to, if we can the root cause of some of the \u201cbumpiness\u201d as you call it Benno. You just contextualize that I'm sure you guys have seen a lot of the other peer reports and none of them have really had bumpiness this quarter in terms of taking pricing and pricing up for a while.","And so I'm trying to figure out why you guys, yes, and then no so much. What are the characteristics I guess another way to ask it about the Bags and Wraps and Wipes categories maybe historically the Cat Litter category, a little while ago is a private label versus brand mix, have you guys analyze things that commodities as percentage of COGS? Is it brand strength? Is a price gap?","And I guess on the last one, if it is price gap, there are many categories of yours that we see the price gaps have expand the lot, nothing happened to the share we agree yet. But, the price gap spend a lot. So I guess really trying to understand how you think, why you think characteristics of the category exist that you think, this price bumpiness is only a bump and only isolated to these two categories?","Benno Dorer","Yes, Ali. So thank you for the question. First of all, I don't want to compare our company to others. I feel like that's perhaps something that you guys can do better. I'd certainly ask if you see as much pricing from your competitors and as much positive gross margin impact from your competitors, so that as we compare Clorox's performance to other companies, we take everything into consideration, but just to reiterate that we feel good about where we are on pricing.","We talked about bumpiness. And we're seeing that in particular on Glad. As I also said before on Wipes, heightened competitive promotional activity is not tied to pricing. So we feel like pricing does exactly what we said it would do, it helps build gross margin, it helps us build market share in the majority of the categories where we took it. It helps grow the categories in the vast majority of categories where we took it.","And there is one issue that we're dealing with on Glad and that's an issue that we've dealt with in the past because clearly, resin costs today are different than where they were at the time when we took pricing and that's what usually happens that you see widen price gaps and you'll see more promotional activity. And then what you'll see us do is react and then you will see those activities subside and you see sales and market share performance stabilized and grow over time because our equity building efforts take hold again.","I want to make sure I remind everybody that on Glad the increased trade spend that we put in place starts to take effect in Q4, not in Q3 and that we're certainly also looking at ways to continue that in further quarters. So again there is really, no news here on pricing. The bumpiness in Glad is one that we had expected, one that has accelerated as resin costs have subsided and one that we know how to manage.","Ali Dibadj","And so just to push further on Glad. As you think about spending an extra $1 in that business to deal with the bumpiness, let's just call it and the short-term bumpiness here, would you rather spend $1 there given that you know this might happen again as commodities roll-up and then back down and to your point, all of us you have lived it for 16 years. Would you rather spend the money there \u2013 the dollar there or in another category, and I ask that in the context of M&A and divestitures in particular of the value it continues to bring or not to your portfolio. And I know in the past you said, we love our portfolio, we love our portfolio. But again, I'm not trying to make a big deal about this one instance, but it is a repeated instance whenever commodities go up or down.","Benno Dorer","Yes. So we still have our portfolio. Ali thanks for the questions. There is nothing changed there and we still have the Glad business, it's driven a lot of value for our shareholders over the last 16 years for sure and we are confident that we'll continue to drive a lot of value in that we have a strategy that continues to work behind a lot of patent and intellectual property protected innovations that are yet to come on this business.","So I would say to your question, would I rather spend the dollars here or elsewhere. There's not an either or question, we're spending the dollars on Nutranext, on Burt's Bees. As Kevin has commented earlier, we are increasing our investments in Burt's Bees, certainly willing to lean into Nutranext, also willing more than we perhaps have two, three years ago to lean into profitable growth areas in international where we're seeing nice success not only through pricing, but also on our brand building efforts whether that's in Burt's Bees Asia, or whether that's on Cat Litter, other parts of the portfolio or international where we have seen really nice volume growth in China.","We've seen a nice volume growth in Europe in Q3, Mexico, Canada all solid and robust markets and we have commented that we are interested in investing more in that part of the business. Our priority certainly continues to be to invest in profitable growth and the long-term brand health of our businesses, our priority continues to be to spend in activities that are driving brand equities behind innovation and the superior value of our brands.","But we also not afraid to defend the businesses where we have to and certainly, big businesses like Glad Trash and Clorox Disinfecting Wipes out two businesses where we're not going to let our competitors steal share from us in ways that are not productive for categories and brands in the long-term. So this is not a question of either or spending on Glad or elsewhere, but the answer here is always and.","Ali Dibadj","Okay. And then just my last question if I may, in that context of spending back, is it 10% of advertising of the trends of sales still applicable for this year, that's a couple 100 basis points up in Q4 to get there?","Benno Dorer","Yes, it's still the same number for this fiscal year and higher in the U.S. remember, and also higher in the back half. So it's still the right number for this fiscal year, early.","Ali Dibadj","Okay, thanks very much.","Benno Dorer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.","Steve Powers","Like you talked a lot about the competitive headwinds in Glad and Wipes already, but I guess just to round it out. I'd love to get a better sense of how long you expect to last as a base case Wipes seems like a, it's a relatively new competitive front of opened up, but any thoughts on duration there just given your past experience will be great.","And then, I'm glad we're the issues have been known for while discussed for a while, I guess you could point to your actions that are coming in the fourth quarter as well as higher oil as perhaps the reason for some relief. But on the other hand, natural gas conditions seem to favor lower resin prices for longer.","And it sounds like maybe Lisah and I don\u2019t want \u2013 maybe Lisah may have alluded to some actual list price rollbacks or other initiatives in her opening remarks in Glad. So just if you can comment on that as well and whether I miss misread or comments that'd be great.","Benno Dorer","Yes. Thanks, Steve. So, first of all, impossible. How long this is going to last, because it certainly will depend on input costs to a certain extent, which is the reason why we're sitting here in the first.","So it's like looking into a crystal ball, but I would say as a base case, typically what we have seen in the past on Glad, but also Wipes, this is not a new phenomenon Wipes, this is something that we have seen in the past before. It takes a few quarters.","And I would assume that that's a good assumption. In this case two and I would also assume if I were you that we are planning for that always remaining agile should the situation changed. But our assumption is that this is going to take a few quarters.","On Glad what we have commented on is that we will we have put trade dollars in place for Q4. But that we're looking at further actions beyond Q4 and we'll update you in August on our thinking for fiscal year 2020.","Steve Powers","Okay, fair enough. And I guess just a real quick one, another thing that I just want to clarify from the opening. Just going back to Lifestyle for a moment, it sounded a little bit like a stark or distinction in the discussion that segment between core and non-core brands and just trying to get a sense of if that's a change or not is the message now that you're going to manage more for profits versus growth or is there a more nuanced takeaway there that you want to walk away with.","Benno Dorer","Thanks for allowing us to clarify their thesis that was not clear, so the distinction we may between strategic and non-strategic was within Nutranext, 80% of the business strategic 20% non-strategic. We have commented on only part of the portfolio being strategic in the past.","Now we're giving you more of a quantification 80%, 20% and, as you'd expect over time portfolio management and also more aggressive portfolio management is part of what we do across all of our company and we'll be a stronger part of our year-to-management of this business, where we largely moving on from integration, but it's no change. And it certainly doesn't affect lifestyle more broadly, obviously lifestyle is a business where if you just look at Burt's Bees as examples several of the businesses are located that we view as strategic growth businesses for the company.","Steve Powers","Right, okay. That makes sense. I obviously miss that. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy","Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to pull together yes, a number of the topics that have been asked on this call. Really forward looking appropriateness of investment levels relative to what you're seeing now with respect to market share.","We spent a lot of time on Bags and Wraps that sort of characterize as more tactical fine as you look at the Nielsen data companies also losing some share in charcoal litter cleaners, et cetera, and of course this is within the context, we've seen a number of CPG companies take up advertising marketing levels among other levers pretty significantly this year.","I just want to make sure I'm clear here on this call. So, without guiding the fiscal 2020, Kevin mentioned some comfort with the 25 to 50 basis points of margin improvement. Longer term, but a couple of things, number one, can you confirm you generally comfortable with investment levels. And then the second piece to that are you prepared to take any sort of major step-up in investment levels for fiscal 2020 off the table without providing guidance for next year. Thanks for that.","Benno Dorer","Yes, Kevin \u201cwithout providing guidance for next year\u201d, if I just maybe just take a step back. So we'll continue to invest in the strategy that we have confidence in with emphasis on innovation engaging consumers digitally and drive a superior value on our brands.","For the fiscal year to 10% as I've commented before 10% of sales higher in the U.S. higher in the back half that's still a right assumption and of course like, like we said we'll update you on August, we're always evaluating the right spending levels we certainly think that the competitive activity and trash and Wipes, as I said, we'll stay elevated and will continue to rise require our attention.","But as we look at our number for fiscal year 2020 would perhaps say that the most important thing here is that we will continue to have a principal approach to spending in advertising and sales promotion. We're not afraid to defend our businesses if this costs money where needed, especially if you feel like it's necessary to keep the brands healthy long-term.","We are also staying focused on investing behind the strategy and we're certainly prioritizing investments in the long-term brand health where we see the opportunity and where we feel like we've got particularly strong ROI is an we commented that during this call on a few businesses like Burt's Bees where we certainly that feel like that's the case. Food behind innovation Nutranext International, so, are we seeing more spend in some of our categories, yes.","We taken the long-term approach, yes. Are we willing to consider an increase in spending levels for fiscal year 2020? Yes, if we feel like that's the right thing to do short-term and long-term, and that's about as much as I think I can say at this point, and the details behind that statement will then come in August. Is that okay? ","Kevin Grundy","I appreciate the color. Thanks Benno. Good luck.","Benno Dorer","Thanks, Kevin.","Lisah Burhan","We\u2019ll take our last question.","Operator","And we have a question from Olivia Tong with Bank of America.","Olivia Tong","Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. I appreciate it. I'll keep it quick. Just I guess relative to your expectations, what was particularly surprising to you? Because you know, the Bags and Wraps competition we've been talking about for some time and clearly a little bit more elevated. But it's been going on for some time, cold and flu season, we already knew the comps obviously, it was coming.","So I guess I just want to better understand relative to your going in expectations, what was surprising and how fast you think you can pivot on, on some of these things, whether it's Wipes PPD and Bags and Wraps. Thanks so much.","Benno Dorer","Yes. Thanks, Olivia. I need a really quick answer. The thing that surprised us was cold and flu, cold and flu. Normally it doesn't have that much of an impact as long as you're staying year-on-year within a certain threshold, but particularly mild a year compared to a very severe last year. It did impact our business more strongly than we had anticipated. And we've commented on that.","And then I would say Bags and Wraps, it has elevated over time as we think about, um, the, the competitive merchandising activity as we went all through the quarter. And that's something that we are prepared to spend against.","So it's really those two. Everything else, execution against the strategy, on track innovation, marketing spend, ecommerce seeing very strong growth with the biggest ECOM customer pricing executed well, cost savings, strong momentum on international neutral, Exxon on track.","So all the things that give us confidence in the strategy. We have executed well feeling good about strong results across many parts of the portfolio and we commented on many of those during this call. So that it's really a cold and flu for the quarter and we've reflected it in the sales outlook and Bags and Wraps, which we have to address, that it.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of the prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Managing Director of Investor Relations for the Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference.","Lisah Burhan - The Clorox Co.","Thanks. Welcome, everyone and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, Clorox' Chairman and CEO; Steve Robb, our Chief Financial Officer. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website, that's thecloroxcompany.com.","Let me remind you that on today's call, we'll refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including but not limited to free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA, and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations.","Reconciliations with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the financial results of our website as well as in our filings with the SEC.","In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release. Please recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcome to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.","With that, I'll cover our Q1 business performance, discussing highlights in each of our segments. Steve will then address our financial results as well as our updated outlook for fiscal year 2018. Finally, Benno will close with his perspective on the business followed by Q&A.","For the total company, first quarter volume and sales, each grew 4%, with sales growing across all four segments. Sales in tracked channels remain healthy and we continue to see very strong growth in non-tracked channels, particularly in e-commerce and clubs.","I will now turn to our results by segment. In our Cleaning segment, Q1 volume and sales, each grew 5%. Sales growth this quarter also include less than two points of benefits from shipments related to the recent hurricane. Cleaning segment's strong top line growth was led by home care, which grew by high-single digits on top of the double-digit growth in the year-ago quarter.","We're very pleased by the continued momentum of our largest SBU, especially as the growth continues to reflect broad-based strength across the Clorox equity portfolio, with all-time record shipments of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, as well as our recently introduced Scentiva wipes and sprays. Consistent with these results, home care delivered its 13th consecutive quarter of market share gains.","In laundry, sales and volume grew mainly behind shipments of Clorox liquid bleach, as retailers stock-up for hurricane-related purchases. The quarter's results also reflect continued growth in our premium Clorox Splash-Less bleach resulting in share gains on total Clorox liquid bleach.","Lastly, within the Cleaning segment, our professional products volume and sales were flat, reflecting the divestiture of the Aplicare business in late August. The balance of professional products business is performing strongly.","Turning to Household segment, first quarter volume increased 7% and sales grew 5%, with broad-based growth across all business units. Starting with our Glad bags and wraps business, sales growth was driven by ongoing success from our premium OdorShield trash bags, especially in e-com and the club channel as well as slight gain from hurricane-related shipments.","In Charcoal, volume grew slightly while sales declined slightly, due to unfavorable mix as well as higher trade promotion investments to support our business. We continue to feel good about our plans for this business going forward and the category is healthy.","Cat Litter volume and sales each grew by high-single digits behind our Fresh Step innovation and strong merchandising support. We're pleased with the strong momentum we are seeing on this business as reflected by four consecutive quarters of market share growth.","Finally, turning to RenewLife, Q1 was the first full quarter lapping the acquisition. We're pleased to report high-single digit sales growth behind distribution expansion, leveraging our sales capabilities. Additionally, we started distribution within the club channel in October.","In our Lifestyle segment, volume increased 2% and sales grew 4%. Burt's Bees delivered double-digit sales growth this quarter, behind the introduction of our new natural cosmetics line, and first-ever distribution expansion of lip care in the club channel. Burt's Bees grew share in the quarter and we're very pleased with our share gains in the lip color category.","In our Brita business, volume and sales declined as gains from innovation behind our new Stream pitcher were more than offset by lower club channel merchandising and a strategic choice to rationalize a lower-margin part of our portfolio. That said, the Stream pitcher is performing well six months after launch, and is now the number two pour-through item behind our Brita Legacy pitcher, which is the market leader.","To wrap up Lifestyle, food volume and sales grew behind strong merchandising in club and grocery channels for bottled Hidden Valley dressings. Consumptions remain very strong, and we are especially pleased that our Hidden Valley brand delivered 11th consecutive quarter of share growth.","Finally, turning to International. Volume was down 2%, although sales grew 1%. Sales growth reflects the benefits of pricing and innovation, partially offset by unfavorable mix and weaker volume in Argentina due to macroeconomic conditions, and in Puerto Rico, from the impact of the hurricanes.","We continue to focus on our Go Lean strategy to drive margin improvement, while selectively investing in Burt's Bees, RenewLife, laundry and home care.","Now, I'll turn it over to Steve, who'll provide more information on our Q1 performance and discuss our updated outlook for fiscal year 2018.","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Well, thanks, Lisah and let me welcome everyone. We're certainly very pleased with our strong start to fiscal year 2018. We delivered strong sales growth and gross margin expansion across all our U.S. and International segments, in what continues to be a tough environment. What's more, we delivered these results on top of strong results in the year-ago quarter.","Turning to our financial results for the first quarter, Q1 sales grew 4%, consistent with volume growth, and our sales results also benefited from about one point of price increases in International, which were more than offset by unfavorable mix, primarily reflecting strong club channel shipments. And as Lisah noted, first quarter sales included the benefit of slightly less than one point from incremental shipments related to the hurricane recovery. At this point, we don't expect the hurricanes will have a meaningful impact on full-year sales.","Gross margin came in at 44.9%, an increase of 50 basis points, reflecting 160 basis points of cost savings and 40 basis points of pricing, partially offset by about 90 basis points of unfavorable commodity cost, particularly in resin, and about 80 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics cost. Selling and Administrative expenses as a percentage of sales came in at 13.6% versus 13.9% in the year ago quarter.","Our advertising and sales promotion investment levels were about equal to the year-ago quarter, with spending in our U.S. retail business at about 10% of sales to support the long-term health of our brands. Our effective tax rate came in at 31% versus 32% in the year-ago quarter, reflecting tax benefits from stock-based compensation.","Now, net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.46, an increase of 7% versus the year-ago quarter.","Turning to cash flow for the quarter, net cash provided by continuing operations was $257 million versus $170 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of $87 million.","Now, I'll turn to our updated fiscal year 2018 outlook which we've updated based on two items; first, the sales impact from the Aplicare divestiture in late August of this year; and second, the cost increases from the recent hurricanes. Our sales outlook now anticipates sales growth in the range of 1% to 3%, due to the Aplicare sale, which is expected to reduce fiscal year sales by slightly less than one point. And given the timing of the sale, we expect to see the first full quarter impact in our second quarter. Importantly, we continue to feel good about our innovation programs and our expectation for about three points of the incremental sales growth for the year from new products.","Turning to gross margin, we now anticipate fiscal year gross margin to be down slightly due to the recent hurricanes. Our updated gross margin outlook reflects an estimated $20 million increase in commodity and logistics costs, most of which is anticipated to occur in our second and third quarters. However, we are continuing to closely monitor commodity costs, which remain volatile. And as a reminder, our previously communicated fiscal year outlook already reflected elevated costs.","Given the timing of the hurricane impact, we anticipate our second quarter gross margin may decrease about 150 basis points versus year ago. Importantly, we believe the hurricane cost headwinds should begin to dissipate late in the fiscal year, enabling gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter.","Turning to our fiscal year 2018 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, based on our updated assumptions for sales and gross margin, we now expect fiscal year diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.47 to $5.67, a $0.05 reduction versus the previous range of $5.52 to $5.72. As we mentioned in our press release, this updated range anticipates about $0.10 of additional costs from hurricane impacts, about half of which we expect to offset with the strength of our execution and underlying business performance.","Looking to the balance of the fiscal year, we anticipate increased volatility over the next few quarters from hurricane-related impacts on our supply chain costs. We will also continue to monitor the trends we previously called out, including the continuation of elevated competitive environment, higher supply chain costs and continued challenging economic conditions in International.","The message I'll leave you with today, is that we have the right strategy in place to work through these near-term challenges. First, we will continue investing strongly in product and brand differentiation to keep our value propositions sharp. We feel very good about our strong investments in demand building, including digital marketing, e-commerce and our product innovation pipeline. Second, we'll continue leaning into our cost savings and productivity initiatives to support our margins. And finally, we'll continue executing our Go Lean strategy in International, in order to improve margins through operational efficiencies. And with that, I will turn it over to Benno.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Thank you, Steve and hello everyone. Let me share with you my three key messages for today's call. First, we delivered another strong quarter and start to our fiscal year, which reflects continued broad scale executional strength against our 2020 Strategy. We delivered 4% volume growth on top of 8% in the year-ago quarter. We grew sales and gross margin in every segment and we delivered 7% diluted earnings per share growth, reflecting our emphasis on good growth; growth that's profitable, sustainable and responsible.","Second, this strong execution and the fundamental health of our business are helping us partially offset the temporary cost headwinds we're facing. While gross margins will be pressured the next two quarters from the impacts of the hurricanes on our cost structure, our business remains fundamentally strong and healthy, as demonstrated by our Q1 results. It is fundamentally strong and healthy, because we have differentiated products consumers love and a solid innovation pipeline that aims to deliver three points of incremental sales growth in fiscal year 2018. We'll be sharing more about our second half new product plans when we speak with you next quarter.","Our business is also fundamentally strong and healthy because we're investing in our brands and we're investing disproportionately in our growth plans, behind demand creation focused on innovation and digital marketing. And with strong ROI, we expect to spend about 50% of our working media budget on digital in fiscal year 2018.","And the result of our focus on differentiated products, innovation and investing in our brands means we're winning with consumers. How do we know? We know we're winning with consumers because the majority of our strategic brands are seen as superior in value, as measured by our Consumer Value Measure or CVM, a combination of product experience, brand equity and pricing.","We use CVM to fine-tune pricing across our portfolio and we feel confident about our pricing strategies and execution. We also know we're winning with consumers because of the strong progress we're making in growing household penetration, with 72% of our portfolio having growing or stable household penetration, up from 31% just four years ago.","Third, we are continually evolving a strategy that has been working and that continues to give me confidence in our ability to create shareholder value over the long-term. To evolve, we will lean into the key value drivers of our 2020 Strategy. We will lean into the prioritization of strong investments in our brand building programs to drive superior value behind innovation and purpose-driven brands. We will lean into the acceleration of portfolio momentum, as we maximize profitable growth and optimize investments between our growth brands and fuel brands. We will lean into the reduction of waste in every aspect of our business, so that savings can be reinvested to fuel growth and to support margin expansion. And finally, we will lean into the continued high engagement of our people as business owners to drive a consumer-centric growth culture.","So in summary, in Q1, we delivered strong results across our portfolio. Our business is healthy and we have plans in place to manage the short-term cost pressures we face. And we're evolving our 2020 Strategy off of a strong foundation, as we discussed with you at our Analyst Day last month.","All of this gives me confidence that we will continue to deliver growth that's profitable, sustainable and responsible and create shareholder value over the long term.","Now, before I open the call up for your questions, I do want to take a moment to recognize the work our teams have been doing across the company to provide humanitarian relief, by donating Clorox bleach and cleaning products, Glad trash bags, and other products, to help support hurricane victims here in the U.S. mainland and in Puerto Rico, as well as for the victims of the Northern California wildfires, the recent earthquakes in Mexico and flooding in Costa Rica. Our disaster relief programs are an important part of our company's heritage and identity and it's tremendously gratifying to have products and highly engaged people that can be of help to so many people.","And with that, operator, you may now open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Dorer. We'll take our first question today from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to start with the sales growth guidance for the year, so, all in now, 1% to 3%, down from 2% to 4% previously, and that includes the one point drag from Aplicare. But setting that aside and then setting aside probably, I guess, what's like 20, 25 basis points or so from the hurricane benefit, was there any change to the 3% to 5% organic sales growth guidance for the year within that range?","And then I guess is part of that, Benno, what is the expectation for industry growth within your guidance? And, I guess, I ask that within the context that your market share performance has been great, I guess, with the exception of trash bags, which I know you guys are addressing, but the category growth has been kind of flattish, at least in Nielsen channels. And I know, I understand it's higher than that outside of non-track, but still not great, seemingly, based on the syndicated data that we have. So, two parts to the question; one, any change within the 3% to 5%? And then two, if you could comment on industry growth guidance within your overall outlook and whether that's changed at all? Thank you.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Kevin, this is Steve Rob. Let me start off. First, just to reground everybody, our previous outlook that we had communicated in early August was for sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%, okay? The latest outlook that we're sharing with everyone today is 1% to 3%. The only reason we're making an adjustment to the outlook is to reflect the divestiture of the Aplicare business in late August, which will reduce sales growth by slightly less than one point. Okay? All other assumptions, there's puts and takes, but generally, all other assumptions remain the same. And we certainly feel good about our first quarter sales growth of 4%.","Now, I do want to make one additional point about first quarter sales growth. We delivered 4%, slightly less than one point was related to hurricanes. But I would also remind everybody, we had the divestiture of Aplicare in the first quarter. That was slightly less than a half a point. So you kind of have to bring the two together to really understand it. And then finally, just as a reminder, all of the numbers that we're sharing today are on a GAAP basis.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah, your second part, Kevin, categories, I would say, overall solid, no change. And we don't expect that to change in our outlook. We think that the future will behave more like the past, and I would say the current situation is characterized by three things; first of all, tracked channels are actually quite solid. They are now growing at about 1%. Historically, they've grown 1% to 2%, in line with population, so that's about at the low-end; but not bad, to be quite honest. Keeping in mind that tracked channels only account anywhere between less than 50% to 80% of our total category, varying by category and SBU.","So, tracked channel is overall pretty solid. The second thing we're seeing is that volume is still tracking ahead of dollars in our categories, and particularly, in tracked channels. Why is that? It's the continued elevated competition, as Steve has noted earlier. That's been elevated for a while, particularly characterized by heavy merchandising, no change versus what we've communicated in the last quarters, also don't expect any change in the future.","And then third, we're continuing to see particularly strong growth in non-tracked channels. Our performance has been strong there for a while. Many of our customers in non-tracked channels are growing double-digits. In Q1, just to dimensionalize, about half of our total company sales growth came from non-tracked channels. E-com is leading the way with the largest e-commerce customer up more than 70% in Q1. So, feeling particularly good about the profitable growth in non-tracked channels. So, overall, steady, and we expect the future to be about the same.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Thank you very much. Good luck, guys.","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Thanks, Kevin.","Operator","We'll go next to Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Thank you for the question. Two questions. First, a small one. Steve Robb, I think you mentioned that \u2013 you reminded us that your results are GAAP results, which we always appreciate the cleanliness of that. Are there any unique costs related to either the hurricane, divestments, that you would call out, that you think most other companies would have pro formaed this quarter?","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","As it relates to the hurricane, no, we didn't. The only thing I would call out with respect to the hurricane that was unusual for us was one, that we picked up some incremental volume late in the quarter associated with shipments; two, I would remind everybody that our International results were negatively impacted, associated with Puerto Rico. This is a business that, you know, we're back up and running, but obviously the country is not where it needs to be. That certainly weighed on International results.","And then third, I think the only other thing to note, and this is related to the Aplicare divestiture, we did, as a part of the divestiture of this business, we did take a charge in the first quarter of approximately $0.03, and that's included in our first quarter earnings per share.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. That's helpful. And then, Benno, a quick question for you. You mentioned everything that you're leaning into to drive growth. One thing that you've leaned into since you've taken the helm has been a slightly more aggressive posture on M&A, both, obviously, with Aplicare kind of shrinking out of it, RenewLife adding into it. I was hoping you could update us on where your appetite sits today in terms of M&A. And as we think about the forward, the bolt-ons that you pursued, is that the right context? Or if an opportunity for something more needle-moving were to surface, would there be interest on your end?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Thanks for that, Jason. So, in order of priority, first priority always will be to keep the core healthy and I think Q1 results demonstrate that we're doing that well, and we want to continue to do that.","The second priority will be to continue to grow RenewLife. That's a category and a business we're very committed to and we want to drive for the long-term. And we feel good about RenewLife. We've obviously had a strong first year after acquisition, grew in the high-single digits in Q1. And in Q2, we'll start expanding with certain club customers, so we want to continue to make that successful as priority number two.","And then three, of course, is because we are in a position where our cash flow enables us to put that cash to use for shareholders, whether that's by serving dividends or buybacks, but also by continuing to look for ways to grow the business.","So, we've always said that we can do more in M&A, but that we don't have to do more in M&A because we have a healthy core, which allows us to be disciplined. So we are looking. We have continued to look in the spaces that we communicated, in particular in the health and wellness space and in areas around our core businesses. We look at companies small and big, anything that can add value to our shareholders.","As Steve has noted often, it continues to be the case that we like those bolt-on acquisitions and RenewLife is a good example of that. But we're not afraid of looking at bigger things if we think that they can add value to our shareholders. But importantly, we'll stay disciplined. So, we made one acquisition over my three years in tenure. I don't know that I would characterize that as more aggressive. I'd call it discipline. Importantly, we have shown that we can integrate an acquisition well and add value. And we certainly can do more and we're looking, but we'll only strike if we feel like we're getting the right business at the right value.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Thanks, Jason.","Operator","We'll go next to Joe Altobello with Raymond James.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. Hey, guys. Good morning. First question, just wanted to go back to something you mentioned, Benno. I think you just said the your categories, at least in the tracked channels in the U.S., you're growing about 1% and I thought your guide for this year was based on flat growth in those tracked channels. So, is that part of the $0.05 offset that you guys called out this morning in regards to the hurricane-related commodity inflation?","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Joe, this is Steve. Couple of things. Our sales outlook contemplates categories that will be flat to up slightly over the course of the full year; keeping in mind, it's still early days, let's see how the quarters unfold as we move through. But that's essentially what we had for the sales outlook.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. So the 1% is consistent with that.","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Correct. Flat to up slightly, yes.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. Okay. And the secondly, on Burt's Bees, you mentioned it was up double-digits, I guess an acceleration from last quarter. And I guess part of that had to do with, I guess, the initial sell-in for cosmetics and the expansion of lip into club. So, if you could quantify for us what that business was up ex those two items, that would be great.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","I don't know that we, Joe, that we give details with that specificity. As you noted, clearly, the lipsticks, the cosmetics launch last quarter has helped. But we're also pleased to say that our core categories have grown share and have grown. Lipsticks continues to be a growth driver as well as the core lip balm. So, it's a combination of all those factors that led to double-digit sales growth last quarter.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","We'll go next to Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. A couple of questions. One is, if you could talk a little bit about pricing? We've certainly been hearing that it's been hard to take pricing to offset commodities, given competitive and retailer pressures. Is that consistent with what you're seeing and what you've done from a \u2013 although slightly lower your pricing guidance for the year? Can you in answering that give us an updated sense of what percentage of commodity cost increases you're offsetting now? And, look, I totally understand your philosophy of not changing the pricing on short-term commodity spikes, but we're seeing that it's much more difficult to take pricing and wanted to see what your observation is about that?","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Ali, this is Steve. Let me try this. I would say the pricing environment is never easy, which is why we try to marry it up with innovation, and we try to be smart in terms of where we take pricing. We've been very successful in taking pricing over the last couple of years, primarily though in International where we're seeing higher rates of inflation. As you know and as we communicated at our last Analyst Day, we are looking to make some pricing adjustments. We're taking an increase on disinfecting wipes and other businesses. That's in our second quarter, and we're just in the process of rolling that out.","So, I would say, over the very long-term, we're confident in the strength of our brands and the investments we're making, and the ability to take pricing. So, time will tell, but I think right now things are playing out about as we expected.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah, and then, Ali, we did talk about our price increase on disinfecting wipes on Analyst Day, that's being implemented as we speak this quarter, and we'll give a more detailed and specific update in our Q2 call in February. But we expect that price increase execution to be done well, and importantly, it's just part of an overall program that on the back of pricing allows us to continue to support innovation on that business. And as you know, our Scentiva platform has been particularly successful lately on wipes and also sprays, which is why we're continuing to expand with new innovation as we speak. So, that's an example of recent price increase that is disciplined and strategic and consistent with our approach to deliver better value for consumers.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So, why is your pricing guidance actually a little bit lower? Is it the price reduction that you told us at your Analyst Day on the mid-size trash bags? Is that what it is? Or \u2013 and why has the guidance been lower a little bit from a pricing perspective in this quarter versus what you'd said last quarter for the year?","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. Thanks for the clarification, Ali. I think what we had said in the previous quarter is that our pricing guidance would be about 1%. I think we're now saying a bit slightly less than one point. I wouldn't over-think it. Foreign currencies are also moving a bit as well, and as you know, in International markets in particular, we try to price to recover not just inflation, but also currency effects. So, I would say when you look at the combination of pricing and foreign currency together, it's about what we would expect. And again, we need to get through the next couple of quarters and see how things play out, but no substantive change there.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Okay. And then the other question was around just kind of leverage from top line to bottom line, 4% top line, 7% EPS this quarter looks pretty good. But going forward, it looks like there's less leverage between the top line and the bottom line. I get that some of that is because of the gross margin and the commodity pressures next quarter or two, I get that. But even when you gave your guidance for 2018, there was less leverage between the top line and the bottom line. I am just trying to understand why that might be.","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. So, the short answer is, it's really two things, one of which you've already called out. If you look at the commodity forecast that we have and inflationary pressures in 2018 versus fiscal 2017, it's quite a bit higher, particularly in our second and third quarters. So I think that's the biggest driver I would call out, is margin pressures driven by higher commodity costs, which are being further exacerbated by the recent hurricanes.","I would also just remind people that in fiscal 2017, we adopted new accounting update around how taxes are treated with share-based compensation. As a result, our tax rate in fiscal 2017 was lower than in fiscal 2016. We're seeing that normalize a bit as we get into 2018. So, there is a little bit of leverage on the tax line as well. So, margin pressures tied to commodities, tax rate, a little bit less leverage there.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","We'll go next to Wendy Nicholson with Citi.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. First question is following up on that question regarding pricing, on the trash bags, have you seen competitors respond to your price reduction, particularly in light of the commodity environment? I wonder if other people aren't lowering their prices to follow simply because they're dealing with the commodity pressure that you're seeing as well. So that's the first question.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah, too early to say on that, Wendy. We will have a better update for you in Q2. That's being implemented as we speak. We've certainly seen the first customers take pricing down as intended on our volume, and we're seeing the positive impact from that, but a little too early to call what will happen on the competitive side.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then two other just quick follow-ups. Number one, on the shipments related to the hurricane, are you confident that that extra shipment volume that you saw late August, beginning of September, has actually sold through? Or is there a risk that some of those extra packs or whatever, are still sitting on the shelf? So does that impact the outlook for the second quarter at all?","And then just second thing, just on RenewLife, I know distribution expansion is a big part of the story, and it sounds like you're making great headway there, but can you just give us an order of magnitude, how far \u2013 like, sort of an ACV type measurement, are you at 30% ACV, and you think you have 80%. I'm just wondering for how long are we going to hear about distribution expansion? Because it's all good, but I just wonder how much growth it can add to the business. Thanks.","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Wendy, let me take the first question and I'll have Benno address the second question. Regarding your first question which is the incremental shipments associated with hurricane, there's no question, but some of that is likely sold through to consumption and then used in the hurricane cleanup efforts. But what's also true, and it's hard to quantify, so the short answer is we don't know exactly, is that likely some of that may have gone into the trade inventories as customers were stocking up in anticipation of the hurricane, and that may partially offset in the second quarter.","So, as we look to our second quarter volume and sales growth, and sales in particular, the things we're watching carefully is, what happens with the hurricane and does some of that reverse out in the second quarter? Of course, we've got Aplicare. That will be the first full quarter where we have the divestiture in the numbers. And so, for a large reason, as we look at the outlook for sales growth on a full year of 1% to 3%, I think if I looked into the second quarter, I think it's possible we'll be at the lower end of that, just because of the Aplicare divestiture and also just because there may be some offsets to the hurricane. But we're 30 days into the quarter, we need to kind of get through and see how that will unfold.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah, Wendy. And then on...","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Oh! Yeah.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Sorry for interrupting. And then on RenewLife for distributing expansion, there's room at least through the end of the fiscal year to keep going on that; we're not done yet for a while. We're obviously in the natural channel. We have some room to grow in food, drug, mass, and obviously club is being expanded as well, but there's still room even within club customers.","But then what I would say is beyond that the real opportunity here is to go from a quantity of distribution expansion to quality of distribution build. What I mean by that is, if you look at stores and you look at shelf placements, you look at clarity of merchandising, quantity of merchandising, all the things that we do so well in our established categories, there's tremendous room for us and what's required to keep building that, which is a long-term strategic approach, is to work with customers on category management as we typically do so well, guiding them on their strategies to grow these categories. And then also innovation, of course, which will help us expand distribution and placements within the customer groups that we're already in, and we will see our distribution machine turn on in the calendar year 2018 and will give you an update as we go little bit further into the fiscal year.","So, distribution expansion was a big reason why we thought we can add value to the RenewLife business. It's been playing out as planned so far, and we still have quite a ways to go.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Hello, everybody. Thank you for taking my question. My question is regarding gross margin. So, I was hoping and I appreciate, Steve, your comment about 150 basis points impact on the quarter \u2013 on the coming quarter. But then what makes you believe that this is going to improve as we go? I think you alluded to Wendy's question on potentially some of the impacts that we saw in the pricing movements you've made. Is that something you're embedding in terms of pricing recovery at some point, pricing pass-through? Or are you just hoping or just baking into your margin \u2013 not margin gains, I'm sorry, market share gains through the balance of the year? Thank you.","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Andrea. Well, we're not hoping. We have good plans in place to drive our margins. Obviously, we're very pleased with the 50 basis points of gross margin expansion in the first quarter. But as I indicated in my opening comments, I do think the second quarter gross margins will be challenged, likely down 150 bps; although it could be a little more or a little bit less than that. Why? Well, number one, it was always going to be the most challenging quarter that we had, because we had rising commodity costs in that quarter. And when you add the impact of the hurricanes, it's even further challenged both in commodities as well as manufacturing and logistics costs. That's the bad news.","Now, the good news is, what we believe, and at least what we've seen in history over time is these elevated costs tend to go on for a couple of quarters. So, our belief is that the challenges will peak in the second quarter. They'll continue into the third quarter, but perhaps a bit better, okay? So, margins will be under pressure in the third quarter, but a bit less.","By the time we get to the fourth quarter, we think that these hurricane-related costs, most \u2013 maybe not all, but most of them should have dissipated. As result, our cost savings, the pricing that we've got planned, the Go Lean efforts in International, combined with our margin-accretive innovation, that all of that should enable us to get back on track to get gross margin expansion.","So, that's our outlook as we know it today. As I did indicate, there's going to be variability across the quarters. Certainly commodity markets today are fairly volatile, but we think we've got good plans in place and we'll see what happens as we go through the next few quarters.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","But just to be clear, you're not putting on the guidance \u2013 including the guidance, any price increase beyond the wipes, right?","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","We have always planned for pricing in International. As we previously communicated, we've got wipes pricing. Beyond that, I won't comment, other than to say, I think we've got good robust plans in place. And the biggest single driver of margin expansion will be the cost savings programs, which we continue to feel very good about.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Thank you, Steve.","Operator","We'll go next to Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thanks very much. Two questions. First, when you talk about the net impact of the hurricanes, at about a dime, does that include whatever profit impact \u2013 and forgive me if I missed this, from the increased Cleaning sales in the current quarter?","And if you could give us a bit about how you went about the process of determining what's hurricane impact and what's not, because it seemed like the lifts in maybe August and September were pretty substantial, but there might be some other stuff going on there.","And the second question was on the advertising, two of the four segments you called out specifically increased advertising and promotion. Just returns you're getting on that, is that more shifted towards digital? You've been leaders in moving advertising towards digital. Are you getting \u2013 is lift getting better, worse? Any comment about that spend level and anticipated returns? Thank you.","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Jonathan, let me take the first part of the question. I'll have Benno address the second. As relates to the impact of the hurricane, these are our best estimates. It's very hard, obviously, to know exactly how much the hurricane impacted us, but we do have advanced analytics. We spend a lot of time trying to understand volume drivers. And so the numbers that we're providing reflect our best estimates as to what we think the impact was in the first quarter for sales growth. Again, we're going to watch and see how much of that may reverse out in the second quarter.","In terms of the earnings impact from the hurricane, I don't think we've specifically communicated it, but it would be at a typical margin that you would expect for businesses like bleach and Glad and businesses that benefited from that lift. Although, again, I'll quickly point out, at least in the first quarter, we did take a $0.03 charge associated with the divestiture of the Aplicare business. So, I think you need to look at, when you talk the hurricane in the first quarter, you need to look at the impact of the hurricane on top and bottom line, but you also need to contemplate that we divested a business, which obviously impacted growth, and had a modest impact or a small impact on earnings. And again, how this plays out over the coming quarters is something we're all going to watch very carefully.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","And, Jonathan, your question on advertising sales promotion, if I put it in strategic context, the strategic choice we've made is to be very aggressive about costs on our business that does not matter to the consumer, take that cost out, and then reinvest it into our brands to create a profitable growth, and do so with discipline and with a strong eye on ROI. And the increases in spend that benefit digital fall squarely into that camp of pursuing profitable growth with discipline and on strategy.","We are pleased with the returns that we see in digital; the returns generally are better than in other media channels, whether that's TV or others. The returns are also getting better year-on-year every year, which is a tribute to our focus on continuous improvements, the capabilities that we are building, and of course, the partnerships that we have with other companies here in the Bay Area and on the West Coast.","So, we like what we do in digital, which is why the spending this year is going to be about half of our total working media budget, which is yet again up from last fiscal year, and also quite substantially higher than what our peer group is doing.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Chris Carey with Bank of America.","Christopher M. Carey - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, everyone. So, just a bigger picture perspective on dynamics you've seen at U.S. mass retail, and how these have sort of evolved over the course of the year. Because clearly destocking in the U.S. impacted some at the start of the year, but not as much for you, but growth in those channels have remained somewhat sluggish into this quarter. So, can you talk to your relative outperformance here and maybe comment on dynamics around shelf space, so the total amount of shelf space maybe not expanding, but the mix or amount of SKUs are consolidating? And then, somewhat related, like kind of how have retailers approach to more premium brands evolved this year as maybe they've given a bit more support to private label? So those two.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","So, in general, the big picture is the state of U.S. mass retail isn't dramatically different from what it's been over the last decade. On your first point, Chris, we certainly haven't seen any destocking. We also wouldn't expect any destocking. We manage our stocks with our customers tightly and electronically and routinely. And if you think about the nature of our products, they are products that are bought on a regular basis, routinely. So, there isn't a lot of up and down.","The broad big picture that I would point you towards is that we're seeing a bifurcation in the marketplace, limited assortment retailers are winning, retailers that are focused on offering consumers value are winning, and as a result private label is gaining more support from retailers and is gaining share, but also market leaders are doing well. And as you know, more than 80% of our portfolio is in market leaders. So we are doing well too, because what retailers do is, as they consolidate shelf space is, they know they need market leaders for growth and they need private label for margin. That's a recipe that we've seen for a while. That's a recipe that retailers are pursuing that we are seeing perhaps accelerate, but that creates tailwind for our brands, which is why we're doing so well, not just with some, but with practically all of our major retailers in the U.S.","Beyond, I would just point to our outperformance on sales growth back to the fact that we invest in our brands versus hunker down. We have innovation, in innovation-starved environment. We invest in digital and in keeping brands relevant and engaging to consumers. So, all the things that create growth the right way, meaning, in a profitable and sustainable fashion is something that we do well, is something that we've done for a while, and is something that, frankly, we're quite good at, and is perhaps somewhat differentiated in today's environment, which is why we are seeing results that we are quite proud of.","Christopher M. Carey - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Shirley Serrao - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. This is Shirley Serrao on behalf of Lauren Lieberman. I just wanted to follow-up on an earlier question around Burt's. It sounds like it's your first foray into club with lip care line. First off, did you displace another competitor here or is this sort of a new focus category for the channel?","And then secondly, we didn't really see any mix degradation in Lifestyle, the way we saw in Cleaning when you gained distribution in club with wipes last year. So, was that offset by something else this quarter or just not as significant as a dynamic in the category? Thanks.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yes. Thanks, Shirley. This was incremental, so not a displacement, but certainly a recognition of the strength of the brand not just in club but in general. And the reason why it hasn't shown up as a negative in mix is that it's actually a very profitable SKU that we have, first and foremost. We've also just started. We certainly hope that over the next few quarters, this is going to continue to grow, but I wouldn't expect it to be a significant drag on our margins in this segment, because, as I said, this is a very profitable SKU.","We, as you know, are very focused on profitable growth. And when we consider expansion opportunities, like this one in club, we want to make sure that we do it based on a position of strength, and this plan certainly doesn't need excessive discounting, which is why we're pleased to see the early success behind this club expansion, but also the profitability.","Shirley Serrao - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Lisah Burhan - The Clorox Co.","We'll take one more question.","Operator","We'll go next to Jason Gere with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. Thanks, guys for squeezing me in. Maybe sticking on the topic of mix a little bit, you're talking about, in Brita, rationalizing some lower margin businesses. So, just wondering as you look at the portfolio, in an industry where it seems like it's very over-skewed and retailers are looking to be more nimble, and you guys are driving a lot of innovation, can you talk about the process of maybe cutting out some unprofitable SKUs or the opportunity to do more of this, which obviously would have a sales impact, but also would be margin beneficial. So, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about that process. Thanks.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Jason. So, we do this as we do everything on our business, systematically, and with an eye on the long-term, and we built this into our outlook and forecast. The process is pretty simple. Every business unit leader, general manager has an annual SKU reduction target. And then, we have a process in place that essentially looks at how incremental SKU is, how profitable SKU is, and then what you always do is cut the tail. What you always do is make other SKUs that are perhaps less profitable, more profitable through cost savings. It's always a source of creativity, and what you do is work with retailers to shift the mix towards the more profitable SKUs. Bleaches, perhaps another example where, and trash, where over the years, we've been tremendously successful to shift the mix, also enabled by innovation, towards more profitable SKUs.","So, something that we routinely do and something that you should expect us to do on an ongoing basis. Certainly believe that, there continues to be an opportunity not just on Brita, but on all businesses to continue to do that. It's good business. Simplification is good. And it's part of our ongoing cost savings and margin improvement program.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Dorer, I'll turn it back to you for closing remarks.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yes.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Steve Austenfeld, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Mr. Austenfeld, you may begin your conference.","Steven Austenfeld - Vice President-Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, Stephanie. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining Clorox's fourth quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, Clorox's CEO, and Steve Robb, our Chief Financial Officer. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com.","Let me remind you that on today's call we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures including, but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt-to-EBITDA, and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the Financial Results area of our website, as well as in our filings with the SEC. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release.","Please recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements.

The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.","Turning to our commentary, there are three key messages we'd like you to take away from today's call. First, we're very pleased with our Q4 and fiscal year 2015 performance, reflecting our efforts to accelerate growth and to do so profitably. Second, our base is as healthy as it has been in recent memory and we're investing behind our business. At the same time, there are a few factors we anticipate will somewhat moderate fiscal year 2016 growth in comparison to fiscal year 2015. And third, we believe our outlook for fiscal year 2016 presents a balanced view that appropriately accounts for current strengths, opportunities, and a few challenges.","With that, I'll cover highlights of our fourth quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our fourth quarter and full year financial results as well as our financial outlook for fiscal year 2016. And finally, Benno will close with his perspective on the business followed by Q&A.","In Q4, sales grew 4% driven by volume growth of 3% and the benefit of price increases, partially offset by 2 points of negative foreign currency. All major currencies were down double-digits due to the strong U.S. dollar with the Argentine peso having the greatest impact. On a currency neutral basis, fourth quarter sales grew 6%. For the fiscal year, volume grew 2% while sales climbed 3%. And on a currency neutral basis, full year sales increased 5 points, reflecting solid growth in the U.S. behind improving category growth rates and 3 percentage points of growth from innovation, as well as growth in international, excluding foreign currency headwinds, behind price increases and higher shipments. This is the fourth consecutive fiscal year we've delivered 3 points of growth from innovation.","Driving improved category trends and market shares has been a top priority for us. And in Q4, our U.S. market share has increased 0.3 of a point versus the year-ago quarter, our largest market share gain in four years. Six of our eight U.S. business units increased market share versus the year-ago quarter with Laundry, Home Care, and Charcoal achieving the greatest gains. And our categories grew 2.8% during the quarter, the strongest rate in several years.","With that, I'll review our fourth quarter results by segment. In our Cleaning segment, Q4 volume grew 7% and sales increased 9% with the sales up strongly in each business unit. Home Care, our largest domestic business unit, was supported by double-digit growth of Clorox disinfecting wipes driven by increased investment in demand building including high levels of quality merchandising support, highlighting the value of Clorox wipes versus competitors' products.","By fiscal year end, Home Care had achieved 14 consecutive months of market share gains. Laundry sales increased mid-single-digits driven by our February 2015 price increase on Clorox liquid bleach. And in June, just a few months ago, we introduced Clorox bleach crystals and solid packs. These non-liquid products provide the power of Clorox bleach in a convenient form for consumers with no spilling or splashing.","Overall, our bleach share for the quarter was flat with gains on Clorox Splash-Less Bleach, offset by declines on a regular incentive bleach products. Splash-Less Bleach is the fastest-growing part of the bleach category and Clorox's share in this premium segment is seven times that of combined private label offerings.","Finally, strong volume and sales gains on our Professional Products business were driven by higher shipments of our base healthcare products as well as professional cleaning and food products.","In our Household segment, fourth quarter volume increased 2% and sales grew 4%, driven by high-single-digit volume gains in our Bags and Wraps business. Premium trash bags continued to be a real contributor, behind innovation on our OdorShield lineup, and new Gain scented trash bags that have had strong early success. These innovations supporting consumers' desire for value-added trash bags as well as price increases taken last calendar year, helped drive higher sales and a meaningful market share gain in the quarter.","Turning to Cat Litter, volume increased slightly driven by our Fresh Step brand while sales and market share declined as a result of continued competitive pressure. We've been investing more aggressively to communicate our excellent clumping and odor control benefit, and to bring innovation to market.","Fresh Step Lightweight Extreme launched in August of last year continues to grow behind its promise to eliminate odor for 10 days, and a money back guarantee. Our Charcoal business, volume and sales declined slightly following very strong double-digit growth in the prior quarter. Looking into combined quarters, Q3 and Q4 delivered all-time record shipments on Charcoal and our business realized strong share gains in Q4.","That said, we're now lapping another double-digit quarter from a year ago, as we anticipate shipment declines in Charcoal in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. In our Lifestyle segment, volume and sales were flat as strong mid-single-digit volume and sales gains in Burt's Bees were offset by slight volume declines in our Brita and Food businesses. Gains in Burt's Bees were driven by the renewal face care line introduced a year ago and ongoing strength in facial towelettes.","Turning to International, volume was up 2% and sales were flat, reflecting the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of foreign currencies, sales for International grew 11%. In the quarter, International grew overall share with strong gains in bleach, surface cleaners, and cleaning utensils.","Now I'll turn it over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our fiscal year 2015 performance and our outlook for fiscal year 2016.","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Steve. And welcome, everyone. We delivered strong results for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 with our domestic businesses delivering fiscal year sales growth at the upper-end of our long-term U.S. target of 2% to 3%. In addition, International delivered strong sales increases on a currency neutral basis behind higher volume and well executed price increases to mitigate inflationary pressures.","Importantly, the strength of our total company results led to a record year of free cash flow reflecting solid top line growth and margin expansion in fiscal 2015.","Now we'll turn to our financial results for the quarter. In our fourth quarter, sales grew 4% with volume and pricing contributing a combined impact of nearly 6 points partially offset by 2 points of unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Gross margin for the quarter increased 270 basis points to 45.6%, reflecting 160 basis points of cost savings, 110 basis points of pricing benefit, and 100 basis points from favorable commodity costs. These factors were partially offset by 80 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs.","Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased 2 points to 14.2% primarily from higher performance-based incentive costs consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy. This compares to an unusually low 12.2% of sales in the year-ago period when incentive costs were lower due to the company's results falling below target. As a reminder, the largest impact from the higher incentive costs is reflected in selling and administrative expenses, but it's also included in higher cost of goods sold and research and development expenses.","Advertising investment for the quarter was close to 10% of sales, reflecting support for our domestic brands and categories at nearly 11% of U.S. sales, partially offset by reduced spending in economically challenged international markets. Importantly, we were pleased to see that our brand investments are paying off and strong category growth with increases in six out of eight U.S. categories. Net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.44, an 11% increase versus the year-ago quarter, driven largely by strong sales growth and margin expansion. In addition, the sale of real estate assets by low income housing partnership contributed a one-time benefit of about $0.06 to diluted earnings per share.","Now we'll turn to our results for the full fiscal year. Sales grew nearly 3% with volume and pricing each contributing a little more than 2 points, partially offset by more than 2 points of foreign currency declines. On a currency neutral basis, sales grew 5%. Gross margin for the fiscal year increased 90 basis points to 43.6% compared to 42.7% in fiscal year 2014, driven primarily by 140 basis points of cost savings and 110 basis points of pricing. These factors were partially offset by 110 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs.","Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased 0.5 point to 14.1%, primarily from higher year-over-year incentive costs. Overall expenses were in line with our expectations for fiscal year 2015 and consistent with our long-term target of about 14% of sales. Advertising spending for the fiscal year was more than 9% of sales, with domestic spending at about 10% of U.S. sales.","For the fiscal year, our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 34.2% versus 34.6% in the year-ago period. Net of all of these factors, our fiscal year diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $4.57 compared with $4.39 in the year-ago period, an increase of 4%.","Fiscal year 2015 free cash flow was $733 million compared with $649 in the year-ago period, an increase of 13%, and this is the highest level we've delivered in more than 10 years. As we mentioned in the press release, we've repurchased about 4 million shares of our common stock at a cost of about $434 million in fiscal year 2015, to offset stock option dilution. We also increased our dividend by 4% in the fourth quarter. At the end of fiscal year 2015, our debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.8, below our target range of 2 to 2.5.","Now, I'll turn to our fiscal year 2016 outlook. As we mentioned in our press release, we anticipate sales growth in the range of flat to 1%, which takes into account several factors. First, we feel really good about the progress we're making in our U.S. business. We're also confident in the strength of our innovation program, which we anticipate delivering about 3 points of incremental sales growth. Second, we plan to increase trade promotion spending to support our brands, including managing price gaps following the two price increases on Glad trash and bleach taken in the last 18 months. And third, we anticipate fiscal year sales to be negatively impacted by several factors in international, including continued slowing of international economies and about 3 points of foreign currency declines, of which about half is anticipated from a significant devaluation of Argentina's currency. In addition, we plan to reduce our international demand-building investments in economically challenged markets, which will also impact sales growth.","Turning to margin, we anticipate gross margin to be about flat for the fiscal year, as the benefit of cost savings, pricing, and somewhat lower commodity costs are expected to be offset by inflation impacting manufacturing and logistics costs. Other moderating factors include higher trade spending and foreign currency declines.","As a reminder, declining foreign currencies negatively impact both our top line results and margins, particularly in markets where we pay for input costs in U.S. dollars. We do anticipate selling and administrative expenses to be slightly below 14% of sales in fiscal year 2016. We also expect EBIT margin expansion in the range of 25 basis points to 50 basis points, reflecting flat gross margins and lower selling and administrative costs.","We project our fiscal year 2016 tax rate on earnings from continuing operations to be between 34% and 35%. Net of all of these factors, we anticipate our fiscal year 2016 outlook for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.68 to $4.83.","In closing, I feel really good about the strong finish to the fiscal year. Incremental investments behind our brands are paying off in category growth and market share gains across several brands. In addition, our team drove operational efficiencies, resulting in another year of strong cost savings, allowing us to expand our margins. In fiscal 2016, we expect to face continued headwinds, particularly in our International business. However, we've managed through these challenges before, and I'm confident in the plans we have in place, including leaning into our pipeline of cost savings programs.","Importantly, we remain committed to using our strong cash flow to invest in driving growth and return excess cash to our stockholders.","With that, I will turn it over to Benno.","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Steve. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. As Steve Austenfeld noted when he opened the call, there are three key messages we have for you today. First, I feel particularly good about our Q4 and fiscal year 2015 performance, in the face of a challenging economic environment, Clorox people have really stepped up to drive results.","We're accelerating growth and we're doing so profitably as evident in the strong top and bottom line results we reported today. And as Steve Robb noted, in fiscal year 2015, we generated the highest level of free cash flow in more than 10 years. Our increased demand-building investments are paying off in category growth and market share gains with Q4 market share growth the highest it has been in four years from strong contributions across most of the portfolio.","And we're making good progress against our Strategy 2020 accelerators. I believe that they will continue to create value to drive profitable growth in the years to come. Two standout examples from fiscal year 2015 of how we're accelerating portfolio momentum, our e-commerce and U.S. Burt's Bees businesses where we stepped up our investments to drive strong double-digit sales gains.","Second, our outlook reflects a very healthy base business, but also the reality of an increasingly difficult international environment. As you think about our fiscal year 2016 outlook, please consider the following. Our strategic choices are working for us in the marketplace and we feel very good about our U.S. business, which is fundamentally very healthy. And at the same time, in our International business, foreign exchange headwinds are strong across all major currencies with recent double-digit exchange rate declines and international economies are slowing. In response, we've made the conscious decision to reduce spending across much of our International business and accept somewhat slower growth in those markets as we focus on rebuilding our margins.","Third, our outlook is balanced, reflecting our view of strengths, opportunities, and challenges. We'll continue focusing on our accelerators, which are working so well for us, including driving demand in our core business as well as trial of new products behind a strong innovation program, supported with increased U.S. advertising, sales promotions, and trade promotion spending.","Our biggest challenge in near-term really is our International business as we've discussed today. Longer term, I feel very good about the prospect for this division. We have leading brands that are growing market shares and we have promising growth platforms, including Burt's Bees, which is now in a large number of countries.","So when the foreign exchange headwinds subside and international economies improve, I do believe our International business will be in a solid position to benefit.","And with that, let's open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Dorer. And we go first to Steve Powers with UBS.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks everybody. I guess, Benno and Steve, you've been calling for the elevated trade spending now for a few quarters and we've been a little slow to see it and I think that help explain the gross margin strength this quarter, which is clearly a good thing, but your guidance implies that you still expect to see it eventually. Can you talk about why we maybe haven't seen it as much as you had anticipated so far and why you're not more encouraged looking ahead to 2016?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Steve, we actually have seen it. In fiscal 2015, we actually stepped up our total consumer demand-building investment and included in that was a step-up of the trade promotion spending. So, we're certainly leaning in and you've seen that in fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2016, particularly in the first half, we are going to continue to lean into the trade spending really to do two things for us. First to drive trial of our new products because we know if we can get trial we generally do well with repeat on those new products. And then second is just to support retail execution. So we have been stepping up the investment, we're going to do a bit more because it's working for us and the payouts look good. But, it is flowing through the P&L.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then competitively, have you seen pretty much what you expected to see or is it's been little bit more benign than you expected?","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would say competitively, Steve, we're seeing what we said we would see. We're certainly spending into our price increases in bleach and in Glad where we feel like that's justified. But, as far as competition is concerned, what we've said is \u2013 before is, that it's somewhat elevated as compared to historical levels, but I would say that it's somewhat elevated certainly not very elevated and that's playing out as we anticipated.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then a question on free cash flow, which was obviously very strong this year again, and you finished the year below your target leverage ratio. So two questions on that. First, this year, the rate of CapEx spending relative to sales was quite low versus history. Do you see that as sustainable or do you see a step-up there as you look out whether 2016 or beyond? And then, with respect to the leverage ratio itself, is there any step-up embedded in guidance there and if you were to step it up, how would you prioritize between incremental repurchases bolt-on deal perhaps in the professional space, et cetera?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. So let me start with the first question on capital expenditures. Yeah, historically, we've spent at the level of depreciation and amortization and I think that's still the right level for the company over the long-term. It has been a bit less than that over the last two years, as you pointed out, and that was a conscious decision on our part, after we had made some pretty significant investments to rebuild R&D facilities, put SAP into the Latin American business. But I think for a long-term modeling, certainly, how we think about it is CapEx should run in line with depreciation and amortization. Terms of the priorities for the use of cash, these remain unchanged. The number one goal is to accelerate top line growth profitability. And we think we've got plenty of cash to do that, but we'd like to do that organically.","Second is, we're still committed to bolt-on acquisitions through our M&A efforts, it's been more challenging over the last couple of years, but we're cautiously optimistic we'll get some traction on that over the next year or two. The dividend has been very important to many of our investors and so we've been prioritizing returning cash through that dividend over the last couple of years and I think you'll see us continue to do that. And then if we've got excess cash that's pooling up, again as we've done for many years either through the dividend or share repurchases, we look to get it back. So no change to capital allocation for the company, it will continue to be disciplined and consistent with the priorities that we've outlined before.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Just to clarify, so no step-up embedded in guidance?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think what we've said for long time is again the long-term debt-to-EBITDA, we think 2 to 2.5 is in our sweet spot, not afraid to let that go down a little below the 2 to 2.5 to build a dry powder for M&A. But we're also not afraid to let it go a little bit above 2.5 for some period of time if we've got good opportunities. So I think you'll see that number moving around over time depending on the opportunities.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go now to Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, good afternoon, guys.","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good afternoon, Chris.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So I guess back when you introduced the 2020 Strategy, the number you gave on promo spending, I think, it was 100 basis points incremental. And so, I guess following up a little bit. Is 100 basis points still the number that you guys expect based on the returns you've seen? And I guess how far of the way through that are you, if you're willing to quantify that at all?","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Chris, good afternoon. So, first of all, what we've said is indeed we would like to spend 1 percentage point of sales over time behind our brands. We've also said that that spending could move around, certainly move around by quarter, but also move around by bucket. So, in some cases, it could be advertising, it could be sales promotion, it could be innovation supports, it could be a trade promotional pricing, really where we see the ROI, as you know we're pretty disciplined in how we measure ROI and how we spend our dollars depending on where we get the greatest return. That is still the right number.","Originally, when we started this Strategy 2020 journey, we thought that we would step into that over time, and we certainly saw an opportunity over the last fiscal year to step into it faster, which we have in the back half. So, this 1 percentage point increase is still the right target. It's working, certainly as you've seen in top line growth, as you've seen in share growth, but it's also working given that, as you know, we're interested in profitable growth, so we see it flow through in the bottom line. So we're staying committed to it and it's still the right number.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And I guess just pushing a little bit on the commodity piece or the gross margin piece. So, you're saying flat gross margins. I guess pricing is positive, which I'm guessing is inclusive of higher expected promo spending. Commodities are positive and you're not seeing by very much. I guess cost savings if you continue to do what you've been doing, it will be pretty good. I guess how bad will manufacturing and logistics be into fiscal 2016? And I guess could you talk about that in light of the fact that, it was only an 80 basis point drag and I say only, because it's been obviously much bigger than that. So, I guess, is that a trend as a follow up question to that and will it be a little more manageable going forward? Thanks.","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good question. As we said, we believe that our gross margins will be about flat, but you'll have some variability across the quarters. Couple of things. What's working for us, our cost savings programs continue to perform well. We're very pleased with the in-market execution of the price increases that we've taken, and we'll continue to look to take pricing, particularly in the international markets, which, as you know, has higher rates of inflation. I think \u2013 and commodities will likely be a tailwind certainly for the first half of the fiscal year is what we're modeling. The things that will mitigate a lot of this, to some extent, manufacturing and logistics was about 110 basis points for the full year this year and I think it's likely to continue to be a headwind for some time for us. FX is a big issue, because that puts a drag on the margins. And then finally as we indicated a few minutes ago, we are going to step-up our level of trade promotion investment behind these new products in retail execution. So, when you net all of those things together, we think gross margin will be about flat. And here is what's important to remember, we've got a good plan in place to drive EBIT margin expansion in fiscal 2016. So, we are targeting 25 bps to 50 bps of the EBIT margin expansion, and we feel like we're very much on track to deliver that for the full fiscal year.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","We go now to Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thanks. First just on \u2013 a little bit on the guidance, because the operating expense comps were a lot tougher in the first half than the second half with the spending and the delta in incentive comps during the second half. So as you think about the cadence of earnings as fiscal 2016 progresses, would you expect to follow a similar pattern to last year or revert to something more in line with historicals?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So you're asking me, what our first half outlook is versus our second half? So I'm going to reference back, we do provide a full year outlook, I think there's a couple of things, though, I will point out about the first half, just as a quick reminder. As you think of the sales growth in the first half, we do need to anniversary some pretty strong Charcoal growth numbers in the first quarter of year ago, so that's an important thing to keep an eye on.","Second thing is, you might recall we have the Ebola and other concerns in the second quarter, so we're certainly going to have to lap those numbers and we're watching foreign currency pretty carefully. But beyond that, there's going to be puts and takes across the quarters and I think we're going to hold to the full year outlook at this point. And keep in mind, we're one month into the fiscal year so I think we need a little more time before we start providing more detailed color.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. You had mentioned in your prepared remarks that you're managing price gaps in bags and bleach, can you talk a little bit more about that?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, certainly, we've taken increases obviously on bleach and Glad, both of which have gone fairly well for us. Although I would say that, historically, particularly on the Glad business, we have spent some of the money back and that's certainly what we're doing. And historically, more than 50% of the resin savings have been spent back in the market and we're doing that, we're spending probably a bit more.","So I would say, on balance, both businesses are doing well from a market share standpoint. We're pleased with the execution, but not unexpectedly we're having to spend some of that back to manage the price gaps which are pretty consistent with what we would expect.","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, Olivia, one thing I'd just add is more broadly that part of the strength that we're seeing on a top line, we certainly think is because we're very focused on delivering value to consumers, so this focus on value is playing out. And while value is more than just pricing, we're certainly always monitoring the price gap and we have good processes in place, making sure the price sensitivity is where it needs to be, and always following a price increase you want to be extra mindful of that and our remarks spoke to that.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks. And if I could just follow up with one more question on Burt's Bees. I mean, it's been a great growth driver for you behind innovation. Is there opportunity to expand that to even more categories, perhaps even into Household, because it seems like you've branched out in terms of licensing the brand a little bit. So just curious on how you think about the opportunity there? Thanks much.","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Thanks, Olivia. On Burt's Bees, like you said, really nice success with double-digit sales growth in fiscal year 2015, which has really been strong also compared to previous years as we stepped up investments.","Three growth pillars. First of all, just continued growth opportunities on the base businesses, the categories that we're already in, in the U.S., in Canada, given that we're seeing opportunities that we have, for the first time, taken advantage now in fiscal 2015 through TV advertising to just grow awareness and trial on the base, and we think that there is a lot of space in this first growth pillar. Second growth pillar, getting into new categories. Third growth pillar, in international.","As for new categories, yes, there still is a lot of opportunity and one thing that we will be doing in the front half that goes exactly after this opportunity is later on in the first half launch color lipsticks. So this is our first foray into lipsticks. It's a category where there is a sizable consumer need for natural products and we have a wonderful product out there, both in terms of product performance as well as in terms of packaging, that we think is highly differentiated and we have started to engage our customers in this opportunity and are getting real enthusiastic response. So that's the next one up where we feel like we can make a significant dent in the new category. But like I said, over time, there should be additional opportunities to get into new categories beyond this.","Operator","And we'll go now to Ali Dibadj with Bernstein Research.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey guys. I want to drill down a couple of things, two things. One is, so given the spending you're describing, it sounds like we should expect next year to be more of a volume-driven year than a pricing-driven year, at least net price, kind of like this quarter, is that fair?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, certainly given foreign currency headwinds, yeah, I think you're going to see volume obviously outstripping sales growth, just because of that.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","For organic I mean?","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Perhaps, Ali, with the exception of international of course where volumes may be somewhat under pressure and where we'll continue to do the best we can on pricing to offset the FX and cost inflation headwinds.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So I want to bring that your gross margin guidance a little bit, because if it is going to be a little bit more volume-driven at least organically, and it reiterates some of the questions earlier. But if pricing is up, volume leverage you're going to get, commodities are a help, cost savings help, and you mentioned the offsets of that are effectively some trade spend, which is only going to be about half of commodities, you really only have FX as the last bucket. And you can make estimates and slice this either way, but it feels like you're talking about several hundred basis points of gross margin impact from FX. I don't know if that can be right. So within that FX, can you disaggregate that a little bit, give us some thoughts on why you think it's that bad. And particularly you mentioned in the release that you're believing there's going to be an Argentinean deval there, that's different than a lot of other companies we're hearing from. So a little bit more detail on that in particular, the offsets particularly around FX would be helpful. I can't get there the way you're describing it.","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. Well, I'll let you do the math. But the three things that we would point out are, number one, the fact that we are going to invest more in the business, that will come through trade spending and, in the short-term, that's depressive to gross margin, over the long-term as you drive trial and repeat, it's a good thing. Manufacturing logistics cost, which does impact us probably a little bit more than other companies because we tend to run heavier loads and longer lanes, so that'll be some pressure. And then, again, foreign currency, obviously, is going to continue to be a drag including Argentina.","Let me spend a minute on your question regarding Argentina because I recognize that we're probably a bit unique in terms of putting this into the outlook, but we think it's prudent to put this into the outlook, and why is that? Well, number one, inflation rates as we all know in Argentina are running well ahead of a lot of other countries. Number two, we've not seen a devaluation in that country for quite some time, most of the leading economists are actually projecting that there will be a major devaluation sometime in the next year or so. And third, and this is a very important point, one of the leading indicators of a devaluation is the difference between the parallel rate and the official government rate and that has been widening pretty consistently in Argentina for some time.","So for all of those reasons, we do think a devaluation in Argentina is likely. Obviously the timing and the amount is very difficult to call, but we wanted to call that out and put that in the outlook because we thought that was important for people to understand. And we'll need to get farther into the year and see how that actually plays out. But we do think there is a real risk for this company and probably for other companies in Argentina.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","You guys have been ahead of the game on Venezuela, so I guess we'll watch this one on Argentina. One last question on the Lifestyle segment, obviously a little bit tougher this quarter, Dressings and Sauces and Brita continues for a little bit. And as both an issue on top line and margins, trying to get a better sense of whether we should expect the historical positive margin mix you were getting from that category to come back or do you believe that you're still going to feel some pressure in that category top line and also margins will be pulling back?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So I would say that when you look at that segment and you're looking at businesses like Brita and Burt's Bees and Food, they have very attractive margins, so there is no change to that. As those businesses deliver growth, that'll give us a bit of tailwind from a margin standpoint, so continue to feel good. The fact that the margin was down a bit in the fourth quarter, not concerned, we're spending a bit more behind Burt's Bees. We've got the lip color launch that Benno talked, that's going incredibly well. So it was a conscious decision in our part to invest a bit more in that business.","And from a top line growth standpoint, I think we continue to feel very good about Burt's for the full year. It was double-digit grower. The Brita business has been a bit of a drag on the business, but I was very pleased to see in the fourth quarter we actually had some positive growth on Brita, and so, I think, some of the actions we're taking are starting to get traction. And again, Hidden Valley Ranch continues to perform well. But we did struggle a bit with the KC Masterpiece and that hurt us a bit in the quarter. So, on balance, feeling very good about the segment and the plans that we've got in place for those businesses.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","And we'll go now to Joe Altobello with Raymond James.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey guys, good morning. Just want to clarify something you said earlier, Steve, regarding the increased promo to address price gaps in both bleach and trash bags. You've mentioned in the past that you did expect some volume impact from that. Has that been going as you expected? Or is this to address something that's gotten worse than your model had predicted?","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Joe, this is Benno. Good afternoon.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi.","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, I would say, if we take those in turn, in Laundry, that's gone about as expected, the category has actually done very well. And the category has done and has been at its best since we've started lapping the compaction a few years ago. So, feeling really good about that and I would call that about in line share continues to grow. So, that's as expected.","Glad, I would call that's better than expected with strong sales growth, but also strong volume growth. And I would associate that with a really strong starts behind our Glad OdorShield Febreze with Gain scented trash bags that have helped us grow not just the dollar share, but also volume share in the last quarter. And we're certainly continued to invest in that, because we have a lot of momentum in that. And in Q1, we'll double down on innovation and we will launch, for the first time, Glad with Clorox trash bags and what that is, is a new premium trash bag with an antimicrobial agent embedded in the drawstring and we think that that'll continue to extend the string of nice successes we've had behind innovation in the categories. So, Glad certainly going better than expected and we're investing behind the momentum.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. Okay. And then, in terms of the Cleaning segment you mentioned up 9% obviously much bigger than what we're looking for, most of that coming from wipes. Was there a merchandising activity that may have pulled forward some demand there? Or was that a real number essentially?","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Joe, if you look at cleaning, the strength actually has been in all parts of the business certainly wipes has been up double-digits. And I would say that we're certainly investing in merchandising, but as we invest in merchandising it's behind innovations and it's to drive trial, because as you'll recall the household penetration in this category is still at\/or about 50%, so I look at that as glass half-empty I guess and there is still an opportunity to keep driving impulse purchases and household penetration that way. But also Clorox cleanup sprays and toilet bowl cleaners and those are significant businesses, they were up double-digits in sales in the last quarter, so I feel like the Home Care strength is relatively broad-based and also fueled by a relatively strong innovation program. Bleach, we talked was up. Clorox 2 grew share significantly and that's been departure from previous trends and we're feeling good about that business. And also, our Professional business displayed really a solid growth. So, in a nutshell, I'm feeling good about the momentum across all of cleaning. We'll keep investing in profitable growth. Certainly results at this point are particularly strong and I would be cautious to say that we should expect a continuation of trends like it. But, I like where we are and I like where we're going.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got you. And just one last one if I could in terms of splash Splash-Less Bleach. I mean, obviously it's a big margin driver for you guys. How big could that be if you look at crystals and the solid packs in terms of a percentage of the overall category? Thanks.","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Tough to quantify in percentages certainly, but, as you know, we are very focused in bleach not just to drive market share, but to drive quality of market share and what we mean by that is to keep shifting the business towards value-added segments. Splash-Less is the star right now. The scented bleach segment falls into that category as well. And this quarter, we will launch bleach packs and bleach crystals, a premium price innovation that gives consumers the performance of Clorox bleach in a more convenient form that's easy to dose. So, we feel like there is significant upside and the consumer is responding to those value-added innovations and we'll keep driving that.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","We go now to Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. Hi. This is Faiza calling in for Bill. So, I just had a couple of questions. One, it sounds like you're moving some dollars from the A&P line to trade spending. So, one, is that fair? And two, is that because you are reducing spending in international markets or is that across the globe and is that because you're finding that the ROI is better on trade spending than on A&P?","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. What we said is that we will spend an additional percentage point of sales and we've said that those dollars will move around, so you will always see shifts between quarters. Within advertising and sales promotion, if you look at advertising and sales promotion is actually up. So, we are spending incrementally in trade, but that spending is incremental to advertising and sales promotion and not replacement to advertising and sales promotion. What we are certainly doing within advertising and sales promotion is shift from international, where the returns in some countries right now are clearly lower and we're not interested in investing in not-profitable volume. And those dollars go into the U.S. where we are seeing a nice return and where you see that deliver strong growth in businesses like Burt's Bees, but also Home Care. So, trade is incremental right now to advertising sales promotion, that's probably going to be here to stay for a little while at the somewhat elevated basis, but we're also continuing to be very committed to advertising and sales promotion spend as is evident in the fiscal year results, and we like the return in that area as well.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. But it sounds like for next year to make the guidance work with the flat gross margin and S&A is slightly below 14 points, it sounds like the ratio is going to go down next year for fiscal 2016?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Faiza, again what we would really focus on is the fact that we do have a plan to get to the 25 bps to 50 bps of EBIT margin expansion. A good chunk of that is going to come from lower S&A costs in part because of the productivity efforts that we put in place in the company and in part because we expect to normalize our incentive compensation cost, so I think that'll be the biggest single contributor. As a company, as Benno indicated, we're going to invest and invest a bit more heavily in consumer demand-building investment, but the mix across the quarters can move between advertising as well as trade.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. And then just wanted to ask again about wipes. So I know the sell-through data has been really good. Can you just talk a little bit more about \u2013 I know there has been a lot of innovation there also, but how sustainable, how should we think about the wipes category going forward?","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So the wipes business has been a growth driver for us for a while and I'm confident that it can and will be going forward. And the way we're going to drive growth is, one, a focus on delivering superior value to the consumer, we have a consumer-preferred product and we're making clear to the consumer that they are aware of this value superiority and we're certainly investing very strongly in advertising sales promotion and also in trade promotion like I said. And then, two, innovation and one innovation that's done particularly well for us over the last six months is the wipes with the micro scrubbers for particularly tough tasks and we're certainly driving that innovation through spending that creates awareness and trial. At the end of the day, while wipes is on trend, we've talked to many of you in the past about consumers moving towards cleaning in the flow occasions that don't disrupt the flow of the day and wipes are the preferred product form to meet this consumer need, so there is a tremendous consumer tailwind. And with the market share of back at about 50%, we're really poised to capitalize on that trend. So, we see tremendous opportunities for continued growth in this segment.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we'll go now to Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good afternoon, folks. Thank you for the question. I want to follow up on the line of questioning around gross margins first, and I apologize if you answered this, I'm trying to multi-task a little bit. But to Ali's question, we get to similar math. You tried to bridge the assumptions and there is a hole of around 200 basis points or so in your gross margin guidance. Is that really the magnitude of FX pressure you're expecting? Or is it maybe the commodity assumption, commodities clearly inflected into a tailwind this quarter. What are you assuming on a go-forward and why shouldn't we expect that tailwind to continue to build?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So \u2013 I don't know if I can bridge all the way, although I will say two points of gross margin drag associated with FX seems a bit large, so let me try to clarify on that. Second, there may be a difference in commodity assumptions again, I don't know exactly how you're modeling the math, but I can tell you that we do expect a modest commodity tailwind certainly in the first half of the fiscal year, but we are expecting energy prices to begin strengthening in the second half of our fiscal year and that we'll start to mitigate some of that tailwind. So, again, we're expecting a very modest tailwind from commodities at this point and maybe that's one of the differences.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And that assumption on energy is that just because it seems like a prudent assumption or are you seeing anything that would lead you to believe that at least in terms of derivative products like resin, they will indeed be firming?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You know when you're dealing with things like resin, it's always a factor of obviously supply and demand, which is the biggest single determinant, and, in that respect, it's reasonably tight out there. And then of course energy prices, which good people can debate it. But I think what we have read and what we have heard is, probably next calendar year, you'll start to see those markets come into balance a little bit more. As a result, that should push back up on energy prices somewhat, so that plus a tightening supply\/demand environment is a reason we believe that the markets will firm. We also saw price increase in resin, actually in May of this year, so we've even seen the early signs that the market's still firming up. To be clear, still down versus year ago, but starting to firm up a bit.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. That's helpful. And now, a quick housekeeping question. The volume strength in Cleaning this quarter was very pronounced, certainly much more than what we would expect to see with some of the scanner data. So was this a matter of just shipments maybe tracking ahead of consumption. Is there some destock risk to be wary of as we head into next year or was there something that happened outside of scan channels? Like, I know you lost a customer over a year ago, did you get that back, or are there any other factors that we should be considering there?","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would suggest, Jason, the one thing you probably can't see through scanner data is our Professional Products business because that's obviously all non-retail. So the strength in that business I think probably helps drive some of the volume strength in the quarter and you're just not able to pick that up.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. That sounds good then. It's \u2013 you're not worried about any sort of shipments ahead of consumption or excess inventory to run-off then.","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No concerns based on what we've been able to see.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good stuff. Thanks. Thanks guys.","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Jason, the one area certainly, and we covered this, but I want to make sure that you guys all register that, certainly is Charcoal, where we did have a very strong Q1 of last fiscal year and where, in contrast, the weather this year, Memorial Day and beyond has been mixed, so there is a chance for lower shipments in Q1 this year, but in cleaning, it's been a clean quarter, no pun intended.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Right on. Well, let's all hope for good weather ahead. Thanks guys. I'll pass it on.","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Jason.","Operator","And we go now to Erin Lash with Morningstar.","Erin Lash - Morningstar Research","Thank you for taking the question. I just wanted to talk about the Cat Litter category for a second. I think you said that the new product innovation that you had brought to market last August obviously continues to struggle or maybe hasn't turned the category from your perspective around as much as you had hoped. And I guess, where do you see or what is your strategic intent to, I guess, drive improving sales and market share? I know you said volumes were up slightly I think in the quarter, but how do you turn around the sales and market share? Is it more just the competitive landscape or are there factors within your control that you feel you can adjust to drive improving performance in that category?","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Erin, thanks for that. So that's a business that we like, it's on trend and category growth is strong. It's a business where historically we've done very well. But, clearly, at this point, it's one of the two businesses that's not growing share. Frankly, if you look at the last four weeks to five weeks share period, it's the only business that's not growing share, so not happy where it is. And my message on the business really is unchanged compared to what we said last quarter. We're not after buying share back, we want to earn share back and what that requires is strong innovation. The competitive landscape in this category has changed, it is a very competitive category and it does require more and more frequent innovation in the category.","We're feeling good about Lightweight litter which, as you noted, was launched last year, and that's growing nicely, and we're investing behind it. But it does require more significant innovation and what we've said before is that that innovation will come in the back half of this fiscal year, and that's exactly what will happen. So, I do think that it will take until the back half until we will see shares materially improve but I'm confident that that's going to happen based on what I know about this innovation, and we'll certainly let you know more once we can talk about it in one of the next quarter earnings releases.","Erin Lash - Morningstar Research","Thank you. That's helpful. And then I just had one follow up on the International business. Obviously, growth has slowed around the world, and you've highlighted that. Clorox has also been very outspoken that they're only going to play in markets where they feel they have a competitive edge. And so, I guess as you look across your international landscape, do you feel that there are opportunities to maybe rationalize where you're playing or is it more just a factor of macro growth coming back and then you're positioned to benefit? Thank you.","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Erin, it's the latter. We're overall happy with our portfolio in the U.S. and beyond. To International, sales grew 11% on a currency neutral basis in the last quarter. And in fact, we're gaining market share in International, so that should tell you that we have strength, we have strong brands that people like, but because of the macroeconomics that strength is not translating into top line that we can count on and bottom line. Fiscal year 2016 is going to be another tough year in international, again driven by macros, in particular of course FX as we expect three points of headwinds, but in the long run you'd have to expect that the fundamentals, the macros improve. And then, I'm confident that we're poised to benefit from that.","Erin Lash - Morningstar Research","Thank you. That's very helpful.","Operator","And we go now to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Just two quick things. One was the follow up on the Professional Products comments. Are those contract wins, so the increased volume in this quarter should be sustainable going forward or is it sell-in for a new relationship?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think it's broad-based. We're seeing our foodservice business has actually done quite well. The Jan\/San business continues to perform well. And we're continuing to expand in the healthcare, just bringing on new items into distribution, but just picking up new contracts as well.","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Lauren, one thing that is sometimes overlooked is that, in our Professional business, e-commerce actually is a significant growth driver as people buy in particular through office supplies customers. So there's nothing unusual in the Professional segments, we're seeing good strength across all segments as Steve noted. Certainly also as we've said earlier in the call, Ebola is something that we're anniversarying later this fall and that's a watch-out as we think about the Professional business for this fiscal year, certainly in the front half. But in general, what we've said is that the Professional business is a growth driver for us as a company and we feel good about the progress and the prospects.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then the second thing was just the other income in the quarter really for the year, just I know it's hard, but what do you think is a best way to think about that for next year?","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Well, keep in mind, there's some one-time items that flow through fiscal 2015, things like the sale of the low-income housing partnership assets in the quarter. So to the extent that you're seeing some one-time benefits come through, we would not project those forward.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. So, best to \u2013 I mean, traditionally I model that line kind of flat, but it can \u2013 that can yield some pretty significant differences because that's not the way it goes, so.","Stephen M. Robb - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I think flat is probably not a bad estimate, again, because the items that occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 where we made some changes, but also in the fourth quarter, those things are going to anniversary out.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you so much.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Dorer, I would now turn the conference back to you.","Benno O. Dorer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Thank you. Let me sum this up. We're pleased to have delivered a strong fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015 financial performance, reflecting our efforts to accelerate growth profitably. Our business is fundamentally healthy and our outlook presents a balanced view of our strengths and the challenges and opportunities we see in the year ahead for our business.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks we will conduct a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce the host for today\u2019s conference call, Mr. Steve Austenfeld, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Mr. Austenfeld, you may begin your conference.","Steve Austenfeld","Thank you. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining Clorox\u2019s fourth quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Don Knauss, Clorox\u2019s Chairman and CEO; and Steve Robb, our Chief Financial Officer. We\u2019re broadcasting this call over the Internet, and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com.","Let me remind you that on today\u2019s call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures including, but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today\u2019s press release, this webcast\u2019s prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the financial results area of our website, as well as in our filings with the SEC.

Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management\u2019s expectations and plans. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management\u2019s expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.","Turning to our prepared remarks. I\u2019ll cover highlights of our fourth quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our financial results and financial outlook for fiscal \u201815 and finally, Don will close with his perspective on the business followed by Q&A.","So, starting with the fourth quarter, including the impact of negative foreign currencies, sales decreased to 2% and volume was flat. On a currency-neutral basis, sales grew 1.5 of a percentage point. The fourth quarter reflected many factors we have seen in recent quarters. Price increases taken mostly in international market were more than offset by nearly three points of negative foreign currency impact primarily from Argentina and Venezuela as well as higher merchandising support to drive share and category growth.","For the fiscal year volume was flat and sales were down about 1.5 percentage point again reflecting the impact of unfavorable foreign rates and higher merchandising support. On a currency-neutral basis, full year sales were up nearly 2% about in line with our most recent outlook. Positively we delivered 3 percentage points of top-line growth from innovation with the third consecutive fiscal year consistent with our long-term strategic target.","In the fourth quarter, our U.S. 13-week market share decrease of three tenths of a points versus the year-ago quarter, reflecting continued intense competitive activity. This slight decline is consistent with results in recent quarters. The luggage market share gains in the quarter versus the year ago quarter were gains on a Kingsford charcoal and Laundry businesses which were more than offset by decreases in our Cat Litter, Brita and Glad businesses. Our categories were about flat in the fourth quarter and category growth for the full fiscal year remain just below our 20-20 strategy assumption of at least one point of annual category growth. Improving our category trends and market shares remains our top 1 priority.","With that I will review our fourth quarter results by segment. Starting with our Cleaning segment fourth quarter volume was flat and sales were down 1%, driven by decreases in our Laundry business due to the lower shipments of Clorox 2, Stain Remover and Color Booster which saw continued category softness and reduced merchandising activity. Volume on Clorox Bleach was up behind market share increases and the introduction of Clorox Smart Seek Bleach. With our return to national merchandising following the concentration of Clorox Bleach last year we have now grown share in the last two quarters.","In Home Care which is our largest domestic business unit, our sales were essentially flat, this reflected lower volume on wipes business offset by very strong performance across the rest of the cleaning portfolio. On wipes we continue to face an intensely competitive environment, which as we noted last quarter resulted in a loss distribution at a major club customer. In response we are increasing investment in 3D demand building including increased consumer promotions, consumer communication across TV, radio and digital highlighting the value of Clorox\u2019s wipes versus competitor products, high levels of quality merchandising and recently launched wipes products for glass, bathtub and shower cleaning. Recently we\u2019ve also seen meaningful distribution gains of several retailers.","As we finished the fourth quarter Clorox remains the clear leader in the wipes category with market shares remaining near 50% interact channels and with share trends improving. We\u2019re optimistic this trend will continue.","Finally, volume and sales gains on a professional products business were driven by higher shipments of cleaning products. Looking ahead for the overall Cleaning segment we continue to expect heightened competitive pressures, which we are aggressively responding to with increased investments to drive brand and category growth.","In our Household segment, volume and sales decreased 2%. The segment\u2019s top-line results were largely driven by lower shipments of Glad trash products due to a March price increase. As anticipated advanced purchases of Glad products ahead of the price increase reduced shipments in the fourth quarter.","However, due to excellent execution at retail our volume and market share performance was better than anticipated. To-date branded competition has generally followed our price increase although at a somewhat slower pace, our private labor response remains mixed across retailers. Due to sustained higher resin prices, we anticipate competitors will eventually raise pricing at the shelf.","Cat Litter volume sales and share decreases resulted continued intense competitive pressures. In response, we are investing more aggressively to reverse market share declines and looking forward to this month\u2019s launch of Fresh Step extreme lightweight. A lightweight Cat Litter product with excellent clumping and odor control that Fresh Step consumers have come to expect from our premium Cat Litters.","And finally our Charcoal business gained market share and grew strongly behind favorable spring weather, strong merchandising support and outstanding sales execution.","Turning to our Lifestyle segment, volume and sales in the segment increased 2% primarily due to strong gains in Burt\u2019s Bees behind new face care products and the launch of new lip crayons which are off to a very good start. Shipments of Brita products grew behind strong merchandising support although Brita sales were down due to incremental demand building investment.","Water filtration category remains soft and our shares decreased due to competitive activity. We anticipate meaningful innovation on our Brita business in the first half of fiscal year 2015, we hope to reserve market share declines.","In our food business volume was flat. Sales were up solidly due to reduced trade promotion spending. We look forward to introducing additional new food items in fiscal year \u201815.","Turning to international our performance in the quarter was similar to what we experienced in the first three quarters of the fiscal year. Namely, volume growth was more than offset by foreign currency declines. In the fourth quarter volume growth of 1% and positive pricing of nearly five points was more than offset by 14 percentage points of negative foreign exchange impacts, primarily from Argentina and Venezuela which resulted in an 8% decrease in sales.","Steve will provide further details on Venezuela and Argentina in a moment.","On a currency-neutral basis international sales grew a healthy 6%. Across our international markets, our market shares remains healthy but we have recently seen a modestly slower growth rate in some countries. With the exception of Venezuela and Argentina we\u2019re continuing to invest in demand building initiatives and innovation to support category growth.","As we close the year we remain committed to growing our categories and market shares to strong brand investment and clearly demonstrating the value of our products, the value our products provide to consumers across the 3Ds.","Looking at fiscal year \u201815 we continue to anticipate sales to be about flat with growth from innovation offset by ongoing softness in the company\u2019s U.S. retail categories and foreign currency declines. On a currency-neutral basis we anticipate total company sales to grow in the range of 1% to 3%.","Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our fiscal year \u201814 performance and outlook for fiscal year \u201815.","Stephen Robb","Well, thanks Steve and welcome everyone.","In the fourth quarter, the company delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of a $1.30 versus a $1.38 in the year ago quarter. This quarter\u2019s earnings per share results reflect $20 million of incremental demand building investments as we stepped up our efforts to revitalize our categories and grow our market shares. While it\u2019s going to take time to realize the full impact of our investments we began to see improving share trends in the fourth quarter. As we look to the fiscal year 2015, investing in our brands and categories remains a tough priority.","Now I\u2019ll review our fourth quarter and fiscal year results in more detail and then discuss our outlook for fiscal year \u201815. In our fourth quarter, sales were down 2%, reflecting nearly three points of negative foreign currency impact and about a one point higher trade promotions spending, partially offset by the benefit of nearly two points of pricing. On a currency-neutral basis, sales grew a 0.5 percentage point.","Gross margin for the quarter declined a 170 basis points to 42.3% compared to 44% in the year ago quarter. The biggest factors contributing to the gross margin decline were about 240 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs and about a 110 basis point of higher commodity costs.","For perspective, included in this quarter\u2019s manufacturing and logistics costs increases were more than a 100 basis points of one-time expenses, including higher supply chain costs in order to meet stronger than anticipated customer demand for our charcoal products. These factors were partially offset by about a 110 basis points of cost savings and about 80 basis points of pricing.","In the fourth quarter, the company invested in incremental $11 million in advertising spending, an increase of more than 8% versus the year ago quarter to more than 9% of sales reflecting strong support behind our brands. Importantly our U.S. retail advertising was nearly 10% of sales.","Selling and administrative expenses were lower in the fourth quarter due to reduced employee incentive compensation accruals, reflecting significantly lower year-over-year payouts consistent with our pay for performance philosophy.","Selling and administrative costs also benefited about a $8 million of cost savings. As anticipated our tax rate of 34.1% from continuing operations was up about 2.5 points in the quarter versus year ago, largely due to favorable tax settlements in the year ago period.","For the fourth quarter, we delivered diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of a $1.30, a 6% decrease versus the year ago quarter. Next I\u2019ll turn to our results for the full year.","Sales declined about 0.5 percentage point in fiscal year \u201814 reflecting more than two points of impact from unfavorable foreign currencies and about a 0.5 percentage point of higher trade promotion spending. Price increases contributed about 1.5 points to sales. On a currency-neutral basis sales grew nearly 2%.","For the year, gross margin was down about 70 basis points to 42.2% compared to 42.9% in fiscal year \u201813 reflecting about a 160 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs and about a 120 basis points of increased commodity costs. These factors were partially offset by about a 140 basis points of cost savings and about 80 basis points of pricing.","Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales for the full year were down 70 basis points at 13.7% compared to 14.4% in fiscal year \u201813, primarily driven by a reduction in employee incentive compensation accruals. We expect selling and administrative expenses to be slightly higher in fiscal year \u201815 about 14% of sales which is consistent with our long-term target. Our target also assumes incentive compensation will return to more normal levels.","Advertising spending for the fiscal year was 9% of sales, a slight increase versus the year ago period, reflecting reductions in challenged markets such as Argentina and Venezuela, offset by continued incremental support for our domestic brands and categories. Our U.S. retail spending was nearly 10% of sales.","Our effective tax rate of 34.7% on earnings from continuing operations was up two points versus fiscal year \u201813 reducing diluted earnings per share by $0.13.","Free cash flow for the fiscal year increased by $50 million to $633 million or 11% of sales versus $583 million or 10% of sales in fiscal \u201813. This increase was primarily the result of lower capital expenditures in fiscal \u201814. In fiscal \u201815, we anticipate free cash flow as a percentage of net sales to be about 10%.","Now consistent with our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, we repurchased about $3 million shares in fiscal year \u201814 for about $260 million. We also increased our dividend by 4% in the fourth quarter.","We ended the year with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.0 at the low end of our target range of 2 to 2.5, reflecting solid cash flow we had in the fiscal year.","As we mentioned in our press release, the company\u2019s fiscal year diluted earnings per share results were negatively affected by the macroeconomic challenges in Venezuela, including a $0.14 charge related to the effective currency devaluation. The result of the company using the SICAD I currency exchange system beginning in March of 2014.","In addition, continued high inflation and government imposed price controls have resulted in sustained operating losses for the company\u2019s Venezuela business.","Net of all of the factors I have discussed today in fiscal year 2014, we delivered diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.26 a decrease of 1% versus the previous year. Now I\u2019ll turn to our fiscal year 2015 outlook.","As Steve mentioned, our fiscal year outlook continues to anticipate sales will be about flat due to continuing headwinds of category softness and foreign currency declines. Excluding the negative impact of nearly three percentage points from currency declines particularly in Argentina and Venezuela, we continue to anticipate sales growth of 1% to 3%. As we mentioned last quarter, sales are expected to be lower in the first half of the fiscal year since we anticipate foreign currency declines to be higher in that period.","As a reminder, we won\u2019t anniversary the meaningful devaluations in Argentina and Venezuela seen earlier this calendar year until the second half of the fiscal year. Sales should also be stronger in the second half as we anticipate seeing the benefits from our incremental trade and consumer demand building investments.","Finally, our sales outlook includes the benefits of some price increases primarily in international as well as product innovation which is anticipated to contribute three percentage points of incremental sales growth.","Our fiscal year 2015 outlook also continues to assume the ability to increase prices in Venezuela. However, we have not yet received pricing relief on our controlled products. As we mentioned last quarter, price controls have been imposed on more than two-thirds of our portfolio for nearly three years. During that time manufacturing costs have more than doubled due to sustained high inflation and our Venezuela business has been operating a loss for more than 18 months. Since the economic environment in Venezuela continues to deteriorate, we are considering all of our options.","Turning to EBIT margin, we continue to anticipate fiscal year 2015 EBIT margin to increase 25 to 50 basis points reflecting moderate gross margin expansion partially offset by incremental investments and demand building programs to help grow our categories and defend our shares.","Given the headwinds we\u2019ve mentioned we anticipate more downward pressure in gross margin in the first half of fiscal year. We also continue to anticipate selling and administrative expenses will be about 14% of sales. We also continue to anticipate an effective tax rate of 34% to 35% in fiscal 2015. And all of these factors we continue to anticipate earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.50.","As I mentioned last quarter, this outlook assumes continued double-digit currency devaluations in both Argentina and Venezuela. Notwithstanding the challenges we faced in fiscal \u201814, I am pleased we delivered another strong year of cost savings. I also feel good about the company\u2019s strong cash flow even in a tough year we generated more than 700 million in cash to invest and return to our shareholders. And as I mentioned we\u2019re planning incremental investments to support our categories and profitably grow market shares in fiscal year 2015.","With that I\u2019ll turn it over to Don.","Donald Knauss","Okay. Thanks Steve and hello everyone on the call. As I reflect on fiscal year \u201814 obviously was a challenging year not only for us but I think the industry in general and our results were significantly impacted as we\u2019ve talked about by the negative impact of foreign currencies about 2.5 points there, price controls in the high inflation markets and softness in our U.S. retail business as people spend more to be competitive and take dollars out of the category and force the commodity cost increases which we do see mitigating somewhat in fiscal \u201815.","Now, while we\u2019re disappointed with those results, I mean a pretty tough environment out there. I do feel good about the progress we\u2019re making on our priorities to build back market share get our categories back growing again and get on course to achieve the 20-20 strategy targets.","As we said many times and we talked about this in October at the Analyst Day out in pleasant and we\u2019re focused on three growth pillars, our U.S. retail business which is about 75% of our business, our professional products business which makes up about 5% and then of course international which contributes about 20%.","Let me take you through a little bit of performance review against those three legs of our stool. So, starting with U.S. retail, as has been mentioned FY14 sales were about flat with lower sales of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes due to the loss of distribution as Steve noted that one of our key club customers. That was offset by gains in the charcoal business. Now that said, we\u2019re going to continue to invest behind our brands as Steve just noted we\u2019ve invested nearly 10% of U.S. retail sales in advertising and sales promotion with total company spending for advertising and sales promotion over our target of 9%.","Now for the total company we met our innovation goal with three points of incremental consolidated sales from new products. I think both Steve have talked about the fact that growing market share in categories are the top priorities in this company and we\u2019re investing heavily in demand creation to improve the consumer value propositions we have out there. That\u2019s why Steve noted, we spend an incremental $20 million in demand spending in the fourth quarter.","Now, in FY14 we\u2019ve also enhanced those 3D tools which will play off benefit in \u201815 as well. It\u2019s going to help balance our return on investment among base innovation adjacencies, pricing, trade spending and advertising and sales promotion spending.","We\u2019re also focused on improving advertising and packaging with harder hitting claims to make the benefits of our brand stand out at shelf and I think we\u2019re starting to see the benefits of that for example with bleach returning back to share growth.","And as I noted in Q4 we increased our demand building investment by $20 million versus the same year ago quarter. As I said that approach is starting to work, we\u2019re starting to see those trends improve on bleach as we promised and we\u2019re also seeing on Clorox Disinfecting Wipes.","We just received the July data which is public and now we\u2019re seeing about nine tenths of a share point gain in July on wipes and two tenths of a share point gain for the three months ending July. So we feel good about promises made promises kept in terms of bleach and wipe shares returning to growth.","So, I\u2019m turning to professional products, we delivered 8% sales growth in fiscal \u201814 that was driven by strong results in cleaning and healthcare partially offset by the impact of a fairly mild cold and flu season. We continue to make good progress here as well with new product innovation and partnerships. In the area of surface disinfection we obtained soft surface sanitation claims for hydrogen peroxide sprays. That\u2019s enabling us to pioneer some new usage educations in healthcare and another commercial channels. And I think as many of you know, we finalized a partnership for the Clorox Optimal UV system becoming the first CPG company out there that focuses on healthcare to provide both a surface disinfected as well as UV technology.","We\u2019ve got a strong pipeline of professional product innovation plan for \u201815 and anticipate a strong year consistent with our long range growth targets of 10% to 15% in that business for this fiscal year.","We continue to believe there are tailwinds in that space and that we do have a differentiated right to win. We\u2019re going to seek to grow our base business with a focus on M&A as well and you\u2019ll see us expanding organically through products and category adjacencies.","Our international sales were down 4% for the full fiscal year and we\u2019re about 11 percentage points of unfavorable foreign exchange impact in numerous markets but as noted this was obviously most significant in Argentina and Venezuela. On a currency-neutral basis our sales internationally grew 7%.","As we said in our press release, the economic environment in Venezuela continues to worsen and we are considering all of our options there. In international as a whole we\u2019re taking the right actions to drive profitable growth in and beyond Latin America and during the fiscal year we focused on the global expansion of Burt\u2019s Bees which continues grow strongly in the internationally markets. We also continue to build out adjacencies in the Middle East and North Africa with the launch of new products across the region continuing growth in cleaners and expansions in the new country.","So, in closing I would say this, look I am feeling very good about setting the organization up for success in \u201815 and beyond. \u201814 was a disappointing year but it was a catalyst for change. And these are the changes that are going to ensure that our brands have the necessary support to regain share and top-line momentum. And as I said I think we\u2019ve got a couple of proved points out there on Clorox Bleach and Disinfecting Wipes.","Our increased spending last quarter and throughout fiscal \u201815 will ensure we continue to be very competitive in the marketplace and that spending is going to be focused on harder hitting advertising and packaging claims that can show the consumers the value of our brands in plain English or plain Spanish or any other country we\u2019re competing in.","So, in addition, our continued focus on cost savings and our agile enterprise initiatives is going to ensure our cost structure continues to be very competitive and that our demand spending increases are sustained overtime. So, these increases are now being built into our base.","And lastly our long-term focus on total shareholder returns is still at the center of everything we do. And I think strong evidence of that focus as Steve noted is the free cash flow we achieved in fiscal \u201814.","The Clorox is fundamentally healthy. We\u2019ve got great brands, we\u2019ve got great people. We know what to do to be competitive in this environment and we\u2019re ensuring \u2013 and to the fact that we ensure our shareholders benefit from that and we\u2019re on it.","And with that we\u2019ll open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Knauss. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs.","Jason English \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Quick sort of housekeeping item. Can you give us the magnitude of the incentive compensation cuts back at the envelope I am getting to around $40 million maybe headwind next year to reload that\u2019s almost $0.20 of EPS. Is that on the right ballpark.","Stephen Robb","That is right. That\u2019s a pretty close number in terms of the headwind that we\u2019ve got it\u2019s actually a little bit higher than that but that\u2019s pretty close.","Jason English \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Thanks for that. And then Don a question for you in terms of brand building A&P support, you run it right at the very bottom of that 9% to 10% target and if we look at A&MP it really hasn\u2019t sort of barged in the last four or five years you\u2019re suffering weaker categories share hasn\u2019t been great. Do you see a need to kind of really up the investment here and throw more money at it to try to get this going?","Donald Knauss","Yeah. I think we do Jason and I think one of the prove points is that $20 million that\u2019s now in the base for the fourth quarter then the additional more than $30 million we\u2019ve added incrementally into fiscal \u201815. I would say this to Jason we compete in some categories where private label is the primary competitor. We have brands that are spending north of 15% in terms of marketing consumer promotion and advertising spend. So we get a little bit lost in the averages here. But to answer your question, clearly there is significantly more support in the fourth quarter of \u201814 and throughout \u201815. That will be baked into the base as we go forward. We\u2019re striving to get an additional full point and as we go towards the 20-20 strategy. And I would say that in those categories where we compete primarily was private label. We\u2019ve got a 100% share of voice. And we\u2019re seeing two of those three categories now we\u2019re private label as loss share in the last quarter. So bleach we\u2019ve gained share of two quarters in a row, private label is loss share, charcoal we\u2019re gaining share again private label losing share. To add we\u2019ve lost some share but we\u2019re finally seeing private label come up and start to match the price increase. So yes, a lot more spending going on if you will and we\u2019re putting it on those brands that needed the most.","Jason English \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it, thanks a lot. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Donald Knauss","Okay.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Powers of UBS.","Stephen Powers \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","I guess on the same them, Steve or Don I guess of your total demand building spend at this point. Roughly how much is devoted to advertising versus trade spend and how is that changed over the years or it has?","Donald Knauss","That ratio Steve is fairly even although it\u2019s probably in the 45-55 range in terms of 40 I\u2019d say low 40s to mid-40s on advertising and consumer promotion and the rest being trade.","Stephen Robb","Yeah let me just build on Don\u2019s comments. We spend about a $0.5 billion a year in advertising and consumer promotion. We spent a bit more than that as you would imagine on the trade spending they go through. So I call it a 60-40, 70-30 split with an emphasis on trade. I think importantly as you look forward to fiscal \u201815, you will see us ramp up the level of demand building investment. We\u2019re going to focus that investment on the vehicles and offer the highest returns. So you\u2019ll likely to see some of that flow into trade spending and some of that flow into advertising and consumer promotions.","Stephen Powers \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","Okay. Thank you for that. And I guess shifting gears towards Venezuela which you commented upon maybe Argentina as well any updates there. But Venezuela specifically, can you just define a bit more about how much pricing you\u2019ve assumed and if you can or can either way. In your respect of the as the likelihood of pricing gone up down or remain unchanged since April. So I guess sense for your comment at some point, if you don\u2019t get the pricing kind of what the magnitude to your guidance would be or whether or even would come to that it sounds like you\u2019re open to that as you say kind of all options. So at what point would you just decide to exit altogether.","Stephen Robb","Okay there is a lot of questions embedded in there. Let me take a try at this. So first, as a reminder Venezuela in terms of sales is a little less than 2% of our sales. Looking forward, based on the most recent devaluation that we saw earlier than this calendar year, I would say the business is probably about a little more than 1% of the company sales. We are losing money in Venezuela as I\u2019ve said for quite some time. I think we\u2019re reaching, rapidly reaching the point where we just have to get pricing. You cannot have double-digit inflation going year-after-year and not get some level of pricing. We certainly requested the pricing, I think we\u2019ve had a constructive dialogue about that pricing. But the reality is we haven\u2019t got anything yet and I think we\u2019ve reached the point with the deterioration of the economic environment, the lack of pricing where all options are on the table. I don\u2019t want to get into the level of pricing, it has been assumed at this point or speculate on what the company may or may not do. Other than to say that we will always do what\u2019s in the best interest of our shareholders, but I think it\u2019s prudent at this point to look at all of the options and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing.","Donald Knauss","And let me add a little more color to the Steve too. I think in some ways Clorox is a bit uniquely disadvantage in Venezuela. When I look at other CPG companies in Venezuela I can\u2019t find another one where almost two-thirds of their portfolio has been under price controls for almost three years. So it puts us in a bit of a unique spot.","I would say to your question do we feel more optimistic, less optimistic? Three months ago we felt more optimistic. We had verbal commitments on pricing in early June that pricing has not been published as of today. That pricing was near what we had requested and I think what other companies have requested. I think the government understands the situation we are in and other companies are in that in Venezuela. But as Steve said, given the operating loss we\u2019ve sustained there over the last 18 months, this cannot go on too much longer before we have to take a decision on what we ultimately do with that business. But I would say today, based on the performance or based on the lack of publishing of that pricing that was verbally agreed to. I\u2019d say I\u2019m more pessimistic than I am optimistic about getting that pricing.","Stephen Powers \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","Okay, thanks a lot. That\u2019s very helpful.","Donald Knauss","Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from Olivia Tong of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Thanks. On cost savings 110 basis points still solid clearly, but that\u2019s a bit like relative to your typical run rate and you obviously reiterated next year. But what caused the deceleration and the cost savings progression and did you already expect that.","Stephen Robb","Yeah so Olivia actually we\u2019re coming off of a record cost savings here in fiscal \u201814. The 100 basis points that you\u2019re referencing is the cost savings that flow through gross margin for the quarter. If I just step back and I look at the year, we delivered probably two full points of margin improvement from the cost savings program. Now about a 140 basis points of that flow through of the gross margin but we also had some additional cost savings flow through selling and administrative expenses and other lines of the P&L. So there has not been a deceleration of the cost savings program, the savings are just flowing in different parts of the P&L.","I would also just echo that looking forward we continue to feel very good about the 150 basis points of cost savings. Although again as I\u2019ve said many times before, we\u2019re going to look at every line of the P&L. Some of that will go through the gross margin probably with most of it but some can also flow through other lines of the P&L including our SG&A costs.","Donald Knauss","Olivia the one other thing I would point out is the fourth quarter for us is our largest sales quarter of the year. So although dollar amounts can vary by quarter. You could have consistent dollar performance from a cost saving standpoint in the fourth quarter but have lower basis point benefit just because of the higher sales.","Olivia Tong \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Got it, that\u2019s really helpful. And then in terms of the businesses. Cleaning it looks like it actually rebounded a bit relative to where you stood in Q3. But households swung down. So how much of that would you attribute to Glad pricing which it just takes a bit of time for that to sort of flow through and you\u2019ll see some buying degradation in the interim versus something that\u2019s a little bit more systemic like the Cat Litter under performance.","Donald Knauss","Olivia I think you picked up on it. A great portion of the decline in household was due to Glad. And I think I mentioned in my comments, that was something we\u2019d anticipated, we checked the price increase in March. We saw a little bit of accelerated purchases from our retail customers and so coming into the quarter we knew that Glad volume would be down. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see that continue to same extent as we move into fiscal \u201815.","Stephen Robb","I think Olivia now that we\u2019ve seen pricing at some of our largest customers being matched from our branded competition as well as private label starting to move up in most customers. I think we\u2019ll see the glad volume decline start to mitigate now. And in the quarter Charcoal almost offset the entire Glad decline. So I think they\u2019ve played kind of a counter balance, but I think we feel more bullish going forward that the pricing is starting to get matched.","Olivia Tong \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Got it, and then just lastly in light of Procter\u2019s announcement this morning about pairing back their portfolio. Can you remind us what your M&A priorities are other than obviously getting bigger in the professional business. Are there certain categories that you are more interested in and of course we know about the professional but in the consumer facing business. Thank you.","Stephen Robb","So we continue to be interested as you said in professional we think that\u2019s an attractive space. We\u2019re also interested in U.S. centric consumer packaged goods companies. We love natural personal care we think that\u2019s interesting. We did a very small acquisition obviously in food additives [sweetening] which is a sauce. So I think any of these mid-sized categories that have good tailwinds attractive margins, U.S. centric would be particularly attractive for us. So, certainly as they look to divest brands it will be something that we take a hard look at as a company to see if there is something that we might be able to extract cost synergies on and accelerate the growth of the company win.","Olivia Tong \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Thanks guys. Appreciate it.","Donald Knauss","Thanks Olivia.","Operator","The next question is from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein Research.","Ali Dibadj \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.","Hey guys. So you and a lot of your CPG players do you have a common theme of incremental demand building some people call it different things, the incremental demand building. And I\u2019m trying to understand underneath it why is that necessary right now so clearly there are many drivers consumer macro other competition rates of the bottom type stuff. So just trying to understand why number one. And then how do you think about the returns you\u2019re getting from the incremental demand building both trade and advertising. And Don maybe if you could chime in at some point about that question given your past experiences in carbonated soft drinks and there I think, they are starting to realize that you got to push more on price mix collectively because the volume just isn\u2019t there and I wonder sometimes especially with your private label competition, why that isn\u2019t that going to be more of the case here or to?","Donald Knauss","Yeah. Let me start Ali and then I\u2019ll ask Steve to jump in as well. I think why it\u2019s necessary I think is to get stronger communication and delivery at shelf on the value of our brands quite frankly I mean we\u2019re calling FY15 for example the year of value for Clorox. And when you look at the value communication, the fact is what we\u2019re doing is an effective job of that like in bleach amount for example like we\u2019ve done in Hidden Valley even though it\u2019s largely most our highly priced premium product we have. We see the positive share results I think the other thing is why it\u2019s so, one reason is just the consumers empowerment if you will and the consumers ability to understand what the best value is out there, and we\u2019ve got to be competitive with that value communication and value delivery at the shelf.","The other thing is in the last year or year and a half, we\u2019ve seen a lot more competitive intensity in the U.S market as other multinationals have been focused on this market. So just the level of competitive intensity is there. Third, I think the retailers need to get traffic into the stores, they continue to push their own retail brands harder. So to be competitive, I think the branded manufacturers have to push their innovation harder and push their own marketing harder as well. So it\u2019s kind of a combination of all those reasons that we think it\u2019s necessary and you know we\u2019ve got and I think this is true of most of our competitors we\u2019ve got a pretty sophisticated return of investment models that give us a really good indication of we\u2019re going to getting a return on that investment or not.","So I think, but those are the three reasons that I see all day out there, why that incremental spending is necessary and I don\u2019t think when I think about our spending relative to our competitors, I think we\u2019ve been very efficient with our spending anyway.","Stephen Robb","I would just echo Don\u2019s comments and say if you go back to the 20-20 strategy we had as a company, one of the things we indicated that we wanted to do was to spend an incremental point of sales in our demand building investment programs. I think what we\u2019ve seen over the last years we\u2019re just going to accelerate that so we\u2019re going to put that point in a little bit faster and a little bit harder than we had originally anticipated, but we\u2019ve got very sophisticated tools, we know that when we put a certain amount into trade, we get a pretty nice lift and when you start to emphasize things like feature and display and doing those things together the brands tend to respond very well.","The advertising it\u2019s getting a lot harder hitting, we\u2019ve got some pretty good score in advertising that we\u2019re bringing to market and we think again investing behind that makes sense. So these are smart investments they are consistent with our long-term goals and objectives and I think we feel very good about.","Ali Dibadj \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.","So this is helpful because I always wonder about the marking ROI sophistication, are sophisticated. I am not as sophisticated and all I look at reported results and I don\u2019t see it right so I\u2019m just kind of?","Donald Knauss","Well, let me give you a few proof points Ali because I think we do have a few. If you look at Bleach we said over a year ago that we would get back to Bleach share growth I mean clearly in the last two quarters we have seen share growth return. We said the same thing on Wipes we said once we got into the June, July period we\u2019d start to see share growth. We\u2019ve had much harder hitting advertising on Wipes, comparative advertising on Wipes and on Bleach. And our packaging is much more declarative on our Wipes business and our Bleach business. So I think where we\u2019re making this focus I think we\u2019re starting to see the share growth that we promised our investors that they would, that we deliver.","So I think there is a proof points out there, I think another one is Charcoal, I mean we amped up the spending there and we started to see share growth come back in the Kingsford brand as well. So I think there is a proof points out there that say it\u2019s working.","Ali Dibadj \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And two quick ones. All in one manufacturing logistic costs, can you give us a little bit more detail about that being negative 240 and then I guess the 100 which is the one time on Charcoal, so any details there and then I know it\u2019s Green Works pricing up 21%, I\u2019m just curious about that? Thank you.","Stephen Robb","Well let me start with the manufacturing and logistics cost, because the fourth quarter gross margin was a bit disappointing in one of the biggest surprises I think for us is and it\u2019s a good news, bad news story. Good news is our Charcoal business was a whole lot stronger than we had anticipated, but to meet that consumer demand and what the retailers were asking for we had to redeploy a lot of inventory across the United States and we encouraged some incremental manufacturing costs that cost us a little over employed. We\u2019re happy to have the growth, we\u2019re happy to have the business, we should hadn\u2019t hurt gross margin as much as it did, but it\u2019s really as one time in nature.","And I certainly think as we look at our gross margins on a go forward basis, I would not have people take this 240 basis points of manufacturing cost and project that forward. I think it will continue to be a headwind but it\u2019s going to be a headwind consistent with what we\u2019ve seen, which is probably a bit north of a point, but certainly not the level we saw on the fourth quarter.","Donald Knauss","On Green Works Ali, we\u2019ve had one of our national top 10 mass customers really recommit to that brand and starting in July, we\u2019ve got depending on the region of that customer, we\u2019ve got 10 to 12 new use SKUs of Green Works into that account. And we think that accounts customers line up perfectly with the Green Works brand consumers as well. So we expect good things out of that so that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing is that initial bump as we go into that customer in a big way.","Ali Dibadj \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.","Thanks very much.","Donald Knauss","Okay.","Operator","The next question is from Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","Hi. Good morning.","Donald Knauss","Hello Bill.","William Schmitz \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","Hey on the S&A side I know you guys are 14% of sales in 2015. Why isn\u2019t that coming down because obviously question before but you know it\u2019s just a function of lower sales growth I know you\u2019ve all this rate ongoing productivity programs in place, but it sort of stay stubbornly in that 14% level? And then I have a follow up.","Donald Knauss","Yeah. I think if you go back a couple of years Bill I am actually feeling very good about the discipline we\u2019ve applied to our SG&A cost because at one point I think just a few years ago it\u2019s about 14.6% of sales fiscal \u201813 I remember it was 14.4% obviously this year we got down to 13.7%, but there is two challenges we face as you look at fiscal \u201815. Number one is we\u2019re going to bring these compensation accruals ideally the comp programs payout closer to target levels. So that\u2019s going to put some upward pressure on SG&A cost. The other challenge is just inflation particularly in some of our international markets.","Now all of that said we feel very good about the cost savings programs and the productivity programs and so we think that should enable us to offset some of these and net-net we should be at about 14% in fiscal \u201815. And our goal is to get as you know is to get there to 14% ideally less and then take some of those savings and reinvest it back in the business. So I would say we\u2019re very much on track with a multi-year plan to get this to 14% or less.","Donald Knauss","Bill I think having to reinstate north of $40 million in incentive comp puts a big rock to hurdle and so I think when you think about it going from 13.7% to 14% that\u2019s about $15 million of increase and we\u2019re offsetting over $40 million of comp. So you can rest assure there is some real productivity in there.","William Schmitz \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","Got it. No, that\u2019s helpful. And then can you just clarify on the Wipe side you said market share was up, was that just Nielsen or is that include some of your panel data on cost gong some of the club stores?","Stephen Robb","The nine tenths of a share point gain Bill was in the multi-outlet data, we get are syndicated data which covered about 81% of our volume. So yeah it was a syndicated data.","William Schmitz \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","Got you. If you do a stab at that I am sure get \u2013 the panel data sort of back in I mean is it flat, is it up you know if you included everything in Wipes?","Donald Knauss","Yeah it\u2019s hard to say we\u2019ve made up about 35% of anything we lost in that one customer already. So I\u2019d say we\u2019re probably flattish to down slightly if you add them back in, we\u2019ll see how they net out on that experiment as we get through the rest of this year. But what has happened is we\u2019ve picked up distribution in a number of key customers and so that\u2019s enabled us as I said to replace about 35% of what we lost in the first five months or already five months into this, we\u2019ve replaced about 35% of it but on the 81% that\u2019s covered we\u2019re feeling very good about almost the full share point of growth.","The interesting thing to Bill if you look at the data if another folks look at the data as we gained share back in the Wipes category the category growth rate accelerates and I think that\u2019s what the retailers are looking at. So for example if you look at the last 52 weeks the category this is ending July the category was up about 13 weeks as we started to gain share it\u2019s up almost 6. So as we gained shared and get back into the game so to speak the category accelerates which you would expect when you get almost a 50 share brand its premium priced.","William Schmitz \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","Got you. And then you guys historically when a brand is troubled you sort of when you promised to fix do you fixed it so would you commit to turning Cat Litter around and gaining market share over the next 12 months?","Donald Knauss","Yeah. That\u2019s certainly in our croziers Bill is that by the time we get into the second half of the fiscal year we want to see much more positive share gain, stabilizing share gains on Litter. I think the initiative with Lightweight starting to ship into two weeks and then you\u2019re going to see revised packaging, you\u2019re also going to see a lot more, what I guess I would call little eye innovation on Litter as we go forward. So, clearly as we get into the second half of \u201815 we expect to see some real improvements in those share results on Litter. And you know it\u2019s interesting Bill to about 45% of our share loss on Litter in Fresh Step in one customer so, we are on it.","William Schmitz \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","Okay, great. And then Steve on last one so the leverage ratios are in two turns now I mean it seems like there is not a lot of do really with the cash so, are you contend letting that ratio continue to lied down?","Stephen Robb","We are going to continue build on what we have been doing which I trying to be disciplined with the allocation of cash. Today what we have been doing last year we had bought $260 million back of shares and obviously increase the dividend 4% I think you will continue to see us focus on keeping a healthy dividend we will probably periodically go back into the market and repurchase shares for no other reasons and then just to offset stock option dilution I think beyond that if cash builds up I am going to look for ways to get that back to the shareholders, the one thing I would remind everyone we do have $575 million worth of debt coming due in January of 2015 so, that\u2019s also something we need to plan for and think for over the next six months.","William Schmitz \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","Great, thank you so much.","Donald Knauss","Thanks Bill.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Ferrara of Wells Fargo.","Christopher Ferrara \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Hey, guys can you I am sorry if you did already but can you just talk about for what fiscal \u201815 what you think the breakout will be on the organic sales between the volume and price?","Stephen Robb","We do expect we haven\u2019t actually given that specific breakdown but would say that we are expecting positive volume growth in the year and we are expecting a modest level of pricing primarily coming at of our international markets to deal with some of the higher inflationary environments. We did fix some pricing earlier this calendar year on Glad we took about a 6% price increase that I think as Don and Steve had mentioned we have seen certainly the branded folks have followed, private label looks like they are beginning to. So, I think you are going to see a mix but certainly we are expecting positive volume growth more leaning towards the second half of the fiscal year as we get more traction on some of the demand building investments and the innovation.","Christopher Ferrara \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Got it. Thanks. And I guess on other note last quarter you ran the one-time balance sheet devaluation like the balance sheet charge, write down of asset charge that happened from the Venezuela and deval through your core numbers right to get to the 106. And I guess I know you are assuming SICAD 1 for 15 but you are not necessarily assuming SICAD 1 stays at 11. But I guess the question do you have incremental balance sheet devaluation running through your P&L baked into the fiscal \u201815 guidance?","Stephen Robb","Yeah, so without getting in again too much detail because there is a lot of synergies that we\u2019ve obviously run here what I would say is that we are assuming number one that we continue to use SICAD 1 as the exchange rate mechanism and then second, we expect that there will be as you say ongoing devaluation what we have not assumed in the outlook is that we got to SICAD 2 which again from a perspective SICAD 1 is at about 10.8, SICAD 2 is closer to 50 so, expect them to devalue SICAD 1 but we expect it to happen over the course of the year and you know I think we have to get into the year see how this palace out there out there has been some discussions about moving to a unified exchange rate at call it 25 to 30 and the only thing we know for certain is that there is three official exchange rates and it\u2019s pretty complicated situation right now.","Christopher Ferrara \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Great, that helps. And I guess what I am asking more specifically to is I am not just talking about sort of the ongoing P&L right but just because it\u2019s fairly atypical that you guys took the balance sheet charge into your number into our P&L like report normalized numbers last quarter do you have coincident balance sheet reduction charge baked into your \u201815 numbers as well not just kind of the ongoing P&L effect.","Stephen Robb","The short answer is yes it is not unusual for companies when you are going through currency devaluations to have both the transaction and translation losses and to referencing but also balance sheet remeasurements so, as our fiscal outlook for both Argentina and Venezuela does anticipate some level of currency devaluation that would include transaction, translation as well as the balance sheet remeasurement component. Again the thing that I continue to emphasize it\u2019s pretty volatile situation with multiple exchange rate so, it gets complicated depending on what the government decide to do but we think we have captured the reasonable place holder for what could occur.","Christopher Ferrara \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Got it, thanks a lot. That\u2019s helpful.","Donald Knauss","Thanks Chris.","Operator","The next question is from Wendy Nicholson of Citigroup.","Wendy Nicholson \u2013 Citigroup","Hi, two questions if I can. First of all the international business can you give us a sense for what the margins there would be if you didn\u2019t have Venezuela? It used to be kind of low double-digit but it\u2019s not back high or is there are there other markets where you are investing at such a rate either expand Burt\u2019s or something like that that business is just structurally lower margin than it used to be.","Stephen Robb","Yeah, so what I will say is that without getting into specifics because I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right to do at this point. The Venezuela business is a fairly good sized drag in the total company and certainly on the International business so, if you took hypothetical that wasn\u2019t in the portfolio then you will certainly in International market that margin come up and you would also see an impact to the total company margins but I really don\u2019t want to speculate as to what the impact would be at this point.","Donald Knauss","Yeah, I think Wendy you not only see I wouldn\u2019t call it significant but you\u2019d see modest increase for the total company you will also see a modest increase on the top line growth rate.","Wendy Nicholson \u2013 Citigroup","Right, okay. And then that leads a little bit into my second question just embedded in your guidance right now for the full year you have talked a lot about kind of how things are going to kick in back-half FX should be less of a drag some of the effect or the boost from your demand building stuff is more back half and the gross margins are going to be down in the first half. Bust just as I am kind of playing with the model here severance on the same page do you think earnings bottom-line EPS is actually going to be up year-over-year in the first and second quarters I know you don\u2019t like to give too much quarterly guidance but maybe just roll on the same page if you\u2019re going to help us with sort of a range of possibilities?","Stephen Robb","Yeah, I think as we said actually we said in last earnings call and as we record again today I think you should expect that based on the foreign currency headwinds which are significant in the first half and the incremental demand building investments that we are putting into this business to defend our market share and get the categories back on track. Sales is very likely to be down year-over-year in the first half and I think earnings could very, very well be flat to down and I think we are going to get in and see what really happens with the currencies in the categories but I think both sales and earnings will be challenged in the first half.","Wendy Nicholson \u2013 Citigroup","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Donald Knauss","Thanks Wendy. Thanks.","Operator","And the next question is from Connie Maneaty of BMO Capital.","Constance Marie Maneaty \u2013 BMO Capital Markets\" Hi.","Donald Knauss","Connie good morning.","Constance Marie Maneaty \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","I have a question on Argentina and I am wondering how you are thinking about it now that there is least in technical default and I am wondering if you think you might need to go to hyper inflationary area accounting sense you know the official rates were inflation of 12%.","Donald Knauss","Correct.","Constance Marie Maneaty \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","But the private forecast that are for 40. And just how does the deteriorating situation there fit in to the outlook right now?","Stephen Robb","Yeah, so a couple of thoughts Wendy \u2013 Connie sorry number one, the technical default of the Argentina debt we don\u2019t think that has any near term impact on our business and we are closely monitoring obviously the economy in Argentina and that was to slowdown that could have an impact and we will also managed closing monitoring the foreign exchange environment to find out if that trigger something around devaluation more than other wise expecting.","In terms of how we manage that business I would say that we continue to manage this pretty tightly because of the inflationary environment and because of the fact that it is under price controls I\u2019ll be with that to take pricing in that market. So, I think we feel good about the Argentina business today it\u2019s certainly challenging situation that we are going to need to work through but I don\u2019t think the technical default is real issue at this point for as.","As far as hyper inflationary accounting that\u2019s really not a determination we would make as a company that is something that you we could be determined by the regulatory bodies and if in fact that happens obviously some of the cost instead of flowing through equity would flow through earnings that is not build into the outlook at this point and I think we just have to wait and see what happens in Argentina over the next one to two years.","Constance Marie Maneaty \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Great, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Donald Knauss","Thanks Connie.","Operator","The next call is from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman \u2013 Barclays Capital","Thanks. Good morning.","Donald Knauss","Hey Lauren.","Lauren Lieberman \u2013 Barclays Capital","Just a question about the, I know bleach shares are up but I was curious about there has been some more activity overall in bleach liquid type launching an oxy product and so on. Just if you see any traction at all from some of others kind of try to impinge on the core properties bleach?","Donald Knauss","Yeah, you know it\u2019s interesting if you go back to the last three years Lauren we probably had the strongest growth on blench in the category in the last 25 years I mean FY12 was $105 and FY13 $107, FY14 $104 in the last two years the volume has been at $106 so, we are starting to see a slower bid but these other activities we are seeing you know these things are typically in the two to one share range so, they are really not having much impact and in fact a lot of times they are even shelved in the bleach category in the store. So we\u2019re not seeing a material impact yet on it.","The other thing we\u2019re doing and you are going to see this with we\u2019ll be launching a thick bleach for cleaning soon. We\u2019re starting see more and more people use bleach as a cleaning agent which is good news for us I think for the category because you use more bleach when you use it as a cleaning agent. Because laundry, when you look at the laundry the trend in laundry in general the loads are going down. So I think and with the use of et cetera laundry is certainly the most relevant piece of bleach usage but we are starting to see a cleaning pick up and that\u2019s where we are going to focus. But we haven\u2019t seen lot of impact yet from these I\u2019ve called them on the tangent items.","Lauren Lieberman \u2013 Barclays Capital","Yeah. And how long do you think does the retailer typically give that sort of product to get a meaningful share before it really becomes irrelevant, is it full year?","Donald Knauss","I think often times you get about six months. It depends on when the modulars are reset but most of the retailers will do a half year check to see if the things has got the unit movement to stay on shelf. I think if you are on the bubble so to speak you are very hard pressed to get a year to stay on the shelf.","Lauren Lieberman \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay. Great. All right. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s what I have left. Thank you so much.","Donald Knauss","Thanks Lauren.","Operator","The next question is from Linda Bolton Weiser from B. Riley.","Linda Bolton Weiser \u2013 B. Riley","Hi. So just going back to your commentary on Venezuela. Unless I misreading your comments it sounds like you are considering as a possible option just completely exiting the market. So I guess if that\u2019s not right what would kind of make you consider that as an option, would it just be a continuation of the losses there? And also some would argue that when you exited Brazil many years ago that, that was actually not the right choice. So maybe you could just I mean Venezuela is of course a different situation entirely. But maybe you could just talk a little bit more about what\u2019s around the decision if you were to exit?","Donald Knauss","Yeah. I think Linda that when we say all options I think we have to mean all options. I think this as you said Venezuela seems to be a bit of a unique case here. And I do think and I think the Venezuelan government understand that Clorox is uniquely disadvantaged given that they kept about two thirds of our portfolio under price control.","So it is a non-sustainable situation. We\u2019ve had very \u2013 we believe constructive dialogue with the government over the last six months in particular. And as I said we thought we had pricing committed in early June, we are still waiting for those price increases to be published. But given the situation we\u2019re in that option has to be on the table unfortunately. And we\u2019ve been in Venezuela for decades. And as the government has said they want businesses to make a fair profit that\u2019s all we wanted to do, is make a fair profit and that hasn\u2019t been the case for the last 18 months. So it\u2019s an option that has to be on the table.","Linda Bolton Weiser \u2013 B. Riley","Okay. Thank you.","Donald Knauss","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes the question and answer session. Mr. Knauss I would now like to turn the program back to you.","Donald Knauss","Well, thanks everyone. I know it\u2019s been a busy earnings day. We certainly appreciate you hanging in there on a Friday with us and we look forward to talking to you at Halloween next time. Thanks everyone.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Mr. Steve Austenfeld, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Mr. Austenfeld, you may begin your conference.","Steve Austenfeld","Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining Clorox's third quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Don Knauss, Clorox's Chairman and CEO; and Steve Robb, our Chief Financial Officer. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet, and a replay of the call will be available for 7 days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com.","Let me remind you that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures including, but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today\u2019s press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the financial results area of our website, as well as in our filings with the SEC. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today\u2019s earnings release.","Please recognize that today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.","Turning to our prepared remarks. I'll cover today's highlights of our third quarter business performance by segment. Steve will then address our Q3 financial results, our updated financial outlook for fiscal '14 and our preliminary financial outlook for fiscal '15. Finally, Don will close with his perspective on the business followed by Q&A.","In the third quarter, including the impact of negative foreign currencies, sales decreased 2%. The impact from foreign currencies was particularly acute in Argentina, as well as in Venezuela where we moved to SICAD I, effectively resulting in a meaningful devaluation. On a currency-neutral basis, sales increased more than 1%, reflecting strong growth in our International and Household segments, partially offset by softness in Home Care due to a distribution loss and ongoing intense competitive pressures in our Wipes business, as well as generally sluggish categories across our U.S. Retail business. Volume decreased 0.5% in the quarter.","Our U.S. 13-week market share results show a decrease of 0.3 points versus the year-ago quarter, reflecting ongoing intense competitive activity. While we saw share gains in our Laundry, Burt\u2019s Bees and Food business and flat results in Glad, these are more than offset by decreases in our Home Care, Brita, Cat Litter and Kingsford businesses. At the same time, our categories grew 0.4 points in the third quarter, although it's a bit slower than the prior quarter's growth rate of 0.6 points due to the impact of extreme weather across much of the nation, and category growth remains below our 2020 strategy assumption of at least 1% annual growth. Improving our category trends and market shares is our #1 priority right now, which Don will further discuss in a few minutes.","Now let me turn to our third quarter results by segment. Our Cleaning segment volume decreased 5% with sales down 4%, driven primarily by decreases in our Home Care business from Disinfecting wipes. As we have discussed, our Disinfecting Wipes business continues to face an intensely competitive environment, more intense than we have seen in years. After we achieved a record share a year ago, competitors have become very aggressive in the marketplace, causing us to increase trade spending to even greater levels than we anticipated a few quarters ago. Volume in our disinfecting products was also impacted by a mild cold and flu season relative to last year.","In addition, the Disinfecting Wipes category has recently seen significant distribution swings among large retailers. During the quarter, we lost Wipes distribution with a club customer while picking up distribution at 2 other key retailers. Clorox remains the clear category leader with market share near 50% in track channels, and with recently improving share trends, we're optimistic this encouraging trend will continue. We remain committed to supporting this business across our 3D demand-building model, including increased consumer promotions; consumer communication across TV, radio and digital, highlighting the value of Clorox Wipes versus competitors' products; high levels of quality merchandising; and recently launched new Wipes products for glass, tub and shower cleaner.","Our Laundry business experienced volume and sales decreases due to category softness impacting our Clorox 2 Laundry additives. However, we are pleased with share gains in the quarter for Clorox Liquid Bleach, which was lapping very high growth in the year ago period and has once again surpassed a 60% market share. Finally, volume and sales gains on our Professional Products business were driven by our Healthcare and Professional Cleaning segments. Looking ahead for the Clean division, we continue to expect heightened competitive pressures, which we are responding to aggressively with increased investments to drive brand and category growth.","In our Household segment, volume grew 5%, and sales grew 4%. The segment's top line results were largely driven by increased sales and shipments of Kingsford and Glad products. Our Charcoal business grew in comparison to a weak year ago quarter and was also driven by increased merchandising support to help kick off the grilling season. That said, Charcoal volume and sales fell short of expectations as weather was, similar to last year, quite poor in much of the country in the third quarter.","Top line growth in our Glad business was driven or due to increased shipments in advance of a price increase and increased merchandising at a number of key retailers. Advance purchases of Glad products, ahead of our March price increase, are likely to reduce shipments in the fourth quarter. That said, we are pleased that we continue to grow share in the higher margin premium Trash Bag segment.","Turning to Cat Litter. Volume increased as a result of strong category growth and increased merchandising, though sales lagged due to unfavorable mix and increased trade promotion spending in the face of heightened competitive pressures. In response, we're looking forward to our August launch of Fresh Step Extreme Lightweight, which we believe will provide the lightweight product many consumers seek with the excellent clumping and odor control that Fresh Step consumers have come to expect from our premium Cat Litters.","Volume in our Lifestyle segment decreased 1% while sales decreased 3%. Sales lagged volume due to higher trade promotion spending, primarily on our Food business. Volume gains in our Food business, from increased shipments of Hidden Valley bottled and dry salad dressings, were more than offset by decreases on our Brita business due to ongoing category softness and competitive activity. We anticipate having a meaningful competitive response out in the first half of next fiscal year on our Brita business.","Turning to our International segment. Volume increased 1%, and sales decreased 6%. Sales lagged volume due to 15 percentage points of negative foreign currency impacts across many International markets, notably in Argentina, Venezuela, Canada, Chile and Australia. On a currency-neutral basis, International sales grew 9%, reflecting very strong gains in strategic growth markets behind innovation and higher brand investments. Steve will provide further details on Venezuela and Argentina in a moment.","With that, for fiscal year 2014, we now anticipate sales to be down slightly, reflecting softness in the company's U.S. Retail business and foreign currency declines. On a currency-neutral basis, we anticipate International segment sales to increase, and total company sales to grow about 2%. Steve will provide additional detail on factors impacting our sales growth in fiscal year '14, as well as discuss our fiscal year '15 sales outlook.","With that, I'll turn it over to Steve Robb.","Stephen M. Robb","Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. So for the quarter, diluted earnings per share increased 5% despite the negative impact of an effective currency devaluation in Venezuela. In March, we started using the SICAD I rate of VEF 10.8 to USD 1 to record our Venezuela business operations. This devaluation reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.13. Excluding this charge, earnings per share from continuing operations is $1.18.","With that, let me take you through the details of our third quarter financial results. Sales for the third quarter declined 2%, reflecting more than 3 points of foreign currency declines, and nearly 1 point of higher trade promotion spending, partially offset by about 1.5 points of pricing, primarily in international and 1 point of favorable mix. Excluding the impact of foreign currencies, sales were up more than 1%.","Gross margin for the quarter came in at 41.8%, a decline of 30 basis points. We delivered $21 million in cost savings or 140 basis points and about 80 basis points from pricing, primarily in International markets. These benefits were more than offset by 120 basis points of commodity costs, primarily related to resin, as well as 120 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs, due in part to continued inflation in International markets, particularly in Venezuela and Argentina.","Selling and administrative expense for the third quarter was about 13% of sales, down 80 basis points versus a year ago, driven by a reduction in employee incentive compensation accruals, reflecting anticipated lower year-over-year payouts, consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy. The total incentive compensation accrual reduction was about $25 million or about $0.12 of diluted earnings per share impact benefiting several lines on the P&L, including cost of goods sold, selling and administrative expense and R&D costs. Advertising spending for the current quarter was nearly 9% of sales. Spending in the U.S. remained above 9% of sales, exceeding investment levels in International. On an absolute basis, advertising dollars were lower as we shifted a portion of our demand-building investment in the current quarter to trade promotion to address the intense competitive environment.","Our third quarter effective tax rate of 35.3% on earnings from continuing operations was more than 1 point higher versus the year ago quarter, reducing diluted earnings per share by $0.02. The higher rate was primarily driven by the non-deductible costs related to the Venezuela currency devaluation this quarter. For the full fiscal year, we now anticipate an effective tax rate of about 35%. Net of all of the factors I discussed today, in the third quarter, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.05. Year-to-date free cash flow was $346 million versus $352 million in the same period year ago. This modest decrease is the result of the timing of tax payments, funding of liabilities under certain nonqualified deferred compensation plans, partially offset by lower capital expenditures.","Importantly, we continue to anticipate free cash flow and the percentage of net sales will be about 10% for the fiscal year. In the third quarter, we repurchased about 1.5 million shares of common stock at a cost of about $130 million. And we also ended the quarter with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.2 to 1, within our targeted range of 2x to 2.5x.","Now I'll turn to our fiscal year 2014 outlook. As Steve mentioned, we now anticipate sales to be down slightly for the fiscal year, reflecting softness in our U.S. Retail business, including lower than previously anticipated charcoal sales in the second half of the year. In addition, our outlook continues to reflect more than 2 points of foreign currency declines for the full year with about 3 percentage points impacting the second half. For perspective, softness in our U.S. Retail business is contributing about 3\/4 of the decrease in our sales outlook with the Venezuela devaluation making up the balance. Higher year-over-year trade spending in the fourth quarter will also temper sales growth. On a currency-neutral basis, sales are now anticipated to grow about 2% for the fiscal year.","Turning to gross margin. We continue to anticipate gross margin for the full fiscal year to be down slightly, reflecting the margin impact of our updated foreign exchange outlook and continued commodity cost headwinds. All other assumptions about gross margin remain generally the same, including an anticipated benefit of 150 basis points from cost savings, partially offset by about 100 basis points of negative impact from inflation affecting manufacturing and logistics costs.","We continue to take pricing actions where possible to help offset higher commodity costs and inflation. And as we mentioned in our press release, we increased Glad trash prices by 6% in March to help offset the rising cost of resin. We continue to expect our fiscal year EBIT margin to be flat to up 25 basis points, reflecting lower selling and administrative expense as a percentage of sales, driven by reduced employee incentive compensation accruals and the company's ongoing productivity programs.","Advertising spending on our U.S. Retail business is expected to be about 9% of sales. With $0.15 of negative impact on the fiscal year from the recent currency devaluation in Venezuela, we now anticipate diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.25 to $4.35 for fiscal year 2014.","Now I'll turn to our financial outlook for 2015. As we noted in our press release, our preliminary outlook anticipates flat sales for the year. On a currency-neutral basis, our outlook anticipates sales growth of 1% to 3%, excluding the negative impact of more than 2 percentage points from currency declines in Argentina, Venezuela and other countries. Following the third quarter devaluations in both Argentina and Venezuela, we expect currency declines to be higher in the first half of the fiscal year. These headwinds, combined with intense competitive pressures, may result in lower sales in the first half of the fiscal year followed by stronger sales in the second half. Finally, our sales outlook also assumes about 3 points of incremental sales growth from new product innovation and the benefit of price increases, as well as the negative impacts of higher trade promotion spending and unfavorable mix.","Now let me make a comment about Venezuela. Our fiscal year 2015 outlook also assumes the ability to increase prices on controlled products in Venezuela where price freezes have been imposed on more than 2\/3 of our portfolio for well over 2 years. Over the last few years, continued inflation in Venezuela has more than doubled our manufacturing costs. Although it's our desire to continue supplying millions of Venezuelans with the product they use every day, we continue to seek immediate, meaningful and ongoing price relief to address the deteriorating margins and operating losses in that country.","Now turning to EBIT margin. For fiscal 2015, we anticipate margin to increase 25 to 50 basis points, reflecting cost savings of about 150 basis points, some benefit from pricing in International markets and moderated year-over-year commodity costs. We expect these factors to be partially offset by high inflation impacting manufacturing and logistics costs, as well as higher advertising investment. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of sales are forecast to be about 14%, which assumes a return to targeted levels of incentive compensation versus the significantly reduced level this year. We also anticipate an effective tax rate of 34% to 35% in fiscal 2015. Net of all of these factors, we anticipate fiscal 2015 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of $4.35 to $4.50. Importantly, this outlook assumes continued double-digit devaluations in both Venezuela and Argentina.","Looking forward, we're committed to accelerating top line growth through product innovation and stepped up investments in our demand building programs. To fund this, we're going to continue to focus on the things we can control, including leaning harder in on our cost savings programs and driving efficiencies to increase productivity.","And with that, I will turn it over to Don.","Donald R. Knauss","Okay, thanks, Steve, and hello to everyone on the call. Well, as Steve said, we delivered 5% diluted EPS in the quarter even with the impact of the devaluation of Venezuela. That said, we're certainly not satisfied with the results of these quarter. And looking ahead, our top priorities are building our market share, driving category growth and getting back to the trajectory to achieve our Strategy 2020 targets. Those are the targets we shared with you last fall on the Analyst Day out here in Pleasanton.","So as we shared with you for several years now, we've looked at our growth strategy in terms of the financial algorithm, which rolls up on our U.S. Retail business, which represents about 75% of our business; our Professional Products business, which makes up about 5%; and then International, which contributes a little over 20% to overall sales. So what I thought I'd do is give you a look at how we anticipate each of those 3 legs of our business contributing to sales growth in fiscal '15.","So in U.S. Retail, our 2020 goal that we laid out for you last fall was growth of 2% to 3% annually. And in FY '15, while it will certainly be challenging to achieve that, particularly in the first half of the year, we believe we have the plans in place to grow near the low end of that range for the full year. Now in the U.S., as you all know, we face an intensely competitive environment and sluggish categories, and the economy continues to be bumpy, just noting the GDP being basically flat for the first quarter as testament to that. Now despite a March uptick in consumer optimism, confidence again dipped slightly in April with consumers reporting less optimism regarding current business and labor market conditions with a proportion of consumers anticipating a drop in income growth, given the increased payroll taxes now for more than a year, and certainly reductions in key government assistance programs like the SNAP program and concerns about health care costs.","Now for us, nothing is more important than probably restoring our U.S. market shares and growing our categories, and we're investing heavily to improve our consumer value proposition. So here's what we're going to do as we head into -- as we are in the fourth quarter and heading into FY '15, our 3D brand-building execution is going to focus on harder-hitting consumer communications that demonstrate visually and through messaging our superior value to drive desire. I think one testament to that is the new bleach advertising I think many of you have seen. Second, superior benefit-oriented packaging and competitive price points at the point of decide. I think an example of that is our new 4-pack Wipes package that is now out there touting our benefits much more boldly. And then lastly, consumer preferred new product innovation with harder-hitting claims that demonstrate our superiority and would delight our consumers. You'll see new Burt's Bees lip crayons, for example, hitting this summer that are 100% natural.","And this -- as I said, those are examples and we think this approach is certainly working holistically on bleach. As we shared with you last fall, when we launched the fully integrated 3D plan, we wanted to reinforce the value of Clorox Bleach and using innovation to differentiate our products versus private label. And I think you can see with our share results, I think they speak for themselves, having once again surpassed the 60% market share. We were at 60.6% for the quarter, the past 13-week period, up nearly 0.5 share point.","The 2020 goal for Professional Products is for 10% to 15% annual growth, and we anticipate this fast-growing business to have another strong year in fiscal '15 to land within that annual growth range. We continue to believe there are certainly tailwinds in that space, and we have a differentiated right to win there as we seek to grow our base business and organically expand through product and category adjacencies.","Now in International, our 2020 goal that we communicated to all of you was annual growth of 5% to 7%. And in fiscal '15, this is where we are most challenged because we face negative impact from foreign currency in numerous markets, as Steve noted most significantly in Argentina and Venezuela, along with certainly difficult operating environments in those 2 countries. We're focusing on the things we can control there such as preserving cash and reducing costs while we work persistently with governments in both countries to secure meaningful price increases. And while we expect we can achieve the segment growth goal on a currency-neutral basis, our outlook reflects continued devaluation in both of those countries. It also assumes we'll be able to execute price increases at some level in Venezuela.","Now factoring in these impacts, we project a single-digit decline for our International business next fiscal year, which is the reason we're projecting to fall short of our annual 3% to 5% sales growth target as a company. Apart from the difficulties in Argentina and Venezuela, our International business remains pretty healthy, and we're executing well. We're seeing growth in many markets in and beyond Latin America and our Burt's Bees business outside the U.S. And I think that's why on a currency-neutral basis, we had almost double-digit growth in International.","Now to summarize, we're certainly facing some speed bumps in the year ahead, and I believe we're being prudent in our assumptions regarding the headwinds we face. Importantly, we have strong plans in place to address them. First, as we noted, we're investing about one additional point of demand spending to support our brand and turn our market shares around and grow our categories. Nothing is more important, and we are keenly focused on ensuring consumers understand the superior value our products offer. Second, we believe in innovation. We remain committed to our goal for 3 points of growth from innovation next year. The August introduction of Fresh Step Extreme Lightweight builds on the innovation we launched earlier this year, including the new Wipes Steve mentioned, Clorox Smart Seeking Bleach and Clorox Fraganzia bleach and more. And third, we're driving improvements in productivity and administrative cost even with increased spending. And finally, we are certainly doing all we can to manage through the challenges in Argentina and Venezuela.","And with that, let's go to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Powers with UBS.","Stephen Powers - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Steve, maybe just a quick clarifying question to begin with, did you -- if I missed it I apologize, but did you talk about or could you quantify the impact of if you aren't able to get the pricing in Venezuela or Argentina that you've assumed what the financial impact would be next year at '15?","Stephen M. Robb","Yes. So our assumption is for pricing next year, it's about 1 point of incremental sales growth for the company as a whole. I will tell you that a small piece of that is Venezuela from a total company perspective. So getting pricing in Venezuela is critical to the health of the Venezuelan business and our ability to continue to produce product for that country and those people. But it's a very small piece of the sales growth that we're counting on next year.","Stephen Powers - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. I guess my real question is more around innovation and the challenges you're facing in categories like Wipes and Brita, Cat Litter. Just given how focused you are on innovation, I just -- I guess I struggle with how you've seemingly exceeded the innovation lead in those categories, opening the door to rivals and\/or copycat private label-type imitations. I guess my real question is why weren't those categories better protected? Or maybe that narrative is incorrect, so if you could set me straight, that'd be helpful.","Donald R. Knauss","Yes. Steve, let me start. This is Don. Let's take it one by one. On Wipes, I don't think we ceded the innovation agenda at all in Wipes. I think what we saw in Wipes after about 1.5 years ago, we hit almost a 60% share just before the start of the '13 flu season. We were pounding on competitors pretty good. And what we saw and basically our Wipes issues are focused in 2 or 3 customers, is we saw an onslaught from private label on pricing. We've always maintained that our brands have the ability to command a price premium. And when we're in the 25% to 30% premium range like we are on bleach, for example, and we're gaining share again, we can do that. When we start getting outside that 25% to 30% band, which is exactly what happened to us in Wipes, we got hammered. Now we've rolled out glass Wipes, which are doing quite well, tub and shower. We've also launched just a new 4 pack, for example, in our largest customer. That's doing extremely well. We're launching a new 5 pack in club, and we're getting much more declarative in terms of our benefits versus competition on that packaging. So I think it's been more of a victim of our own success in Wipes and creating a bit of a pricing umbrella, which we are managing now. But I think from an innovation standpoint in terms of the quality of the Wipe, getting into different Cleaning occasions like glass and tub and shower, I don't think anybody touches us there. So that's Wipes. On Litter, I think this is again a value issue. If you look at our share loss over the last year, 2 share points, it's all in Fresh Step Scoop Away, which is our value brand that's held share, in fact, built a little bit of a tick up in share. And we did get outflanked in innovation, I believe. And I think sometimes we are -- we try to be too perfect, and perfection's the enemy of progress. I think the lightweight product that we are coming out with in August is a better product, we believe, than our competitors have. At least that's our consumer testing. It's also only a 12% premium versus competitor products that are light-weighted that are over a 50% premium versus regular litter. So I think we're going to retake the high ground in Litter as well. In terms of Brita, we are the category in Brita. And again this was a -- not so much a lack of innovation although there has been in total. I mean, the innovation we did on on-the-go bottles, for example, driven us to an 80% share. And in fact in the April data that we just got yesterday, we've seen Brita gain share in total again. I think we did get, again, outflanked on a pricing standpoint. I mean, we got up to a 50% premium on our 3-pack filters versus private label competitors. That cannot stand. And right now, we're going back through and looking at how we allocate retail customer marketing funds and trade funds to get more into the cost of goods to lower that price to get it back into a 25% to 30% range. You're also seeing new innovation from us on bottle-on-the-go. We just launched a 34-ounce solid bottle. And you're going to see new pitchers and new filters from us in FY '15. So that kind of gives you a snapshot, Steve, of how we're trying to launch and reclaim the ground that we've lost. But a lot of this has been because of extremely competitive pricing pressure.","Operator","We will take our next question from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So 2 questions for me. Just talking about the Wipes distribution losses. My understanding is, a very large customer but their category growth has really slowed since the transition has occurred, and I'm just curious kind of if you think perhaps you might be able to get back distribution just given some of the category trends. And then the second question is kind of more bigger picture is I've always regarded Clorox as best-in-class when it comes to category management. You guys do a great job of managing the businesses you're in. And I just wondered just given the top line has been struggling for quite some time, and I get the macro environment, I understand that. But it just seems like you could put your capabilities more to use by being a little bit more acquisitive in other categories within the supermarket, and I just -- Don, I was wondering if you can just philosophically explain kind of how you think about that?","Donald R. Knauss","Yes, okay. Thanks, Nik. Yes, on the first question, the customer that we lost distribution in and I've lived through this in other companies. It's typically -- this is an annual program. We'll see if it -- if we can make an adjustment inside that 12 months. But to your point, their category is down in significant double digits. And interestingly, the distribution that we picked up in another large customer, their Wipes category is now larger as a total category in Wipes than the other customer. But we don't have an 80% share in that customer. So we haven't made up totally the volume there. But I think we've not only gained distribution in another top 5 customer, but we've also picked up in another top 10 -- 2 other top 10 customers, some incremental distribution. So I think it'll play out over the course of the next 3 to 6 months as we build that back. We always have hope that we'll be able to go in where we lost the distribution, especially after a 6-month check-in with this customer to see, if those trends continue at the current rate, we would expect and hope that they would be open to that discussion. But I think with the distribution we have gained in other customers, and that continues to build and with the innovation around the 4 pack and the new 5 pack and glass, et cetera, I think we feel much better about our position. And in fact, I would say to you just like we told you folks in October that we would see share gains on bleach again in this quarter, which we delivered on. I think we're confident that you will see share gains again from us on Wipes in May and June as we cycle through this. So feel good about that. As far as the other thing, Nick, on igniting these categories and getting more category growth, we are pushing harder into adjacencies. Let's take Hidden Valley as an example. We now have the #2 brand in pasta kits, for example. We have the #2 in sandwich spreads or the #3 in sandwich spreads now. So our dry dip and dry salad business is growing 14%, 15%. So we are starting to push into these adjacencies and you'll see more of that as we go forward. We're doing everything we can to ignite the growth by looking at adjacencies. We'll also continue to look at acquisitions that are down the middle of the fairway for us like we did with Soy Vay. Clearly, that's a small business, but it's really growing at double digit rates. So beyond Personal Care or Healthcare, the second priority for us is acquisitions that are in those core categories for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Two quick questions. First, a housekeeping item. I think I heard you when you're talking about fiscal '15 guidance say that you're assuming continued currency erosion in Venezuela and Argentina. Did I hear that correctly?","Donald R. Knauss","Yes.","Stephen M. Robb","You did. We're assuming double-digit decreases in both the Argentine peso and the Venezuelan bolivar next year. To be really clear about it, we moved to SICAD I, and we expect that as more of a free-floating rate, it'll continue to devalue. So we're not assuming it'll go to SICAD II, but we are expecting ongoing devaluation.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Sounds like a pretty prudent assumption. Now I want to turn my attention to a category you haven't really talked about, liquid cleaners. It's the category that by our data, just looking at the Nielsen numbers, you've been losing quite a bit of share in for a pretty persistent period of time with private label gaining, SC Johnson gaining, P&G gaining. Can you talk about some of the dynamics in that category, and what may stem those share losses?","Donald R. Knauss","Yes. Well, let me start by saying this, Jason. I think in Home Care, we actually -- we've been hit by share losses primarily because of Wipes. But to your point, on dilutables in particular, we lost share on Pine-Sol. Although there is light at the end of the tunnel. In March, we saw actually a total -- in total Home Care, we saw a share gain of 0.2 share point. And I would say this on Pine-Sol. I think what's -- we've seen a lot of innovation from Procter on Mr. Clean, and we've seen a lot of competitive pricing from other competitors in that space, right, from Fabuloso from Colgate. So clearly, we're focused on innovation around Pine-Sol, the squirt mop thing we just rolled out, it's too early to tell how that's going. But you'll see new fragrances from us. You'll see different bottle shapes and sizes down the road from us. But it's clearly going to be -- it's an innovation game, and it's also a pricing, same kind of issue I talked about in the other categories where we've let our price gap drift up too much, and that's one of the things we're going to reference. Now as I said, I think we feel good about the fact now that Home Care shares in total are growing again. And I do think you'll see our Wipes shares regain and rebound in May and June. And the dilutable piece is something we're focused on but with an innovation bend, as well as looking at our trade spending and how we deploy those funds to get the pricing on shelf right.","Operator","Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Quick question first. You talked about the fact that embedded in your fiscal '15 outlook is your assumption that you will get some pricing. So you've obviously had a couple of discussions with the government around getting pricing in Venezuela, Argentina. But what's sort of plan of action if those discussions don't turn out fruitful and pricing isn't an option?","Donald R. Knauss","Okay, let me take that, Olivia. We have been in high-level discussions with the government. I think we want nothing more than what the Government of Venezuela wants, which is to be able to make a fair profit. And I think they recognize the straits that our business is in and the fact that something has to give or certainly the business, in its current form, is not sustainable. So I think we'll be able to give you a much better update when we get to the August call as we work through these issues with the government. But given the recent price increases they awarded to the Food segment in that country, I think we have some level of optimism that we're going to be able to get this pricing through. But I want to be really clear for everyone and with our investors that I just want to build this algorithm for you so that there's no confusion or that there's any conclusion that we're overly dependent on getting pricing in any given market. When we put the top line algorithm together, we said, look, we've got about 3 points of growth from innovation and 1 point of growth from pricing, and about 90% of that pricing is in International markets. Now that gives us 4 points of growth. We've got more than 2 points of currency headwinds in this thing. So let's just round it to about 2.5 points of currency, and that includes these double-digit assumptions on devaluations in Venezuela and Argentina, which as Jason noted, we think is prudent. That gets us down to about 1.5 points. The reason we're not coming out with a higher top line estimate than the flat that we put out there is given the competitive intensity in the U.S. and the volatility of foreign currency, we don't think it's prudent to promise more to investors than that. So we may be accused of being somewhat prudent in these assumptions, but we think that's the right way to go.","Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then you mentioned a couple times about price gaps drifting up too much between you and private label and some of your other competitors.","Donald R. Knauss","Yes.","Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And with that, you've got a fiscal '15 outlook for 25 to 50 basis points of EBIT margin expansion despite the fact that FX will still be a near-term drag. So can you talk about some of the puts and takes within that margin? If you've got to spend more, you've got to promote and price more, is cost saves coming up to offset that delta or what else is going on in the equation to help offset that?","Stephen M. Robb","Sure. This is Steve. Let me lead off on that. So it starts with the gross margin expansion. As we look into next year, we, number one, have very good cost savings programs planned. So we feel very good about that. And as Don and as I noted earlier, we are also anticipating about 1 point of pricing. And we think those 2 factors are going to be sufficient to kind of overcome inflation and commodity cost increases and should lead to solid gross margin expansion next year. And I think if you let that just flow through the bottom line and again we're going to continue to aggressively pursue savings on the SG&A line, we think the combination of those 2 things should translate into solid EBIT margin expansion.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","My 2 questions. First of all, just on Venezuela. I think you've already been taking some pricing on a piece of your portfolio. Is that not correct?","Stephen M. Robb","Yes, we \u2013 the -- with that 2\/3 of our products, a little over 2\/3 are under price controls, 1\/3 is not. We've been able to get very small limited amounts of pricing in the non-controlled categories historically.","Donald R. Knauss","And Wendy, one thing I would note, too, that of the pricing that we've assumed for Venezuela next year, almost half of it is carryover pricing that we've already gotten this year.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. Okay, fine. And then turning to the Wipes business, if I'm not mistaken and I may have a faulty recollection here, but I think you used to do some private label manufacturing for the Wipes business for certain customers and then you decided to exit that. But given how private label is gaining share and seems to sort of be a more persistent thorn in your side, I guess, number one, does that reflect your loss of control over private label since you're no longer doing it? And would you entertain bringing that back in house?","Donald R. Knauss","Yes, we didn't do private label on Wipes, Wendy. We did private label on Food bags in Glad that we exited about 5 years ago. So we've never done private label on Wipes. I would say that with the tremendous focus on private label in a couple of key customers, what is happening is the category is now slowing to -- I mean, the category grew in the last quarter just 0.5, and this is a category that was growing in the mid-singles consistently for quarter after quarter after quarter. So I think the retailers who have driven this hard are recognizing that it's almost impossible to drive a category forward if you don't have the 50 share branded guy who's premium priced driving with you. So I think as I said, I'm pretty confident as we sit here today that you're going to see our shares rebound there. But I think private label has its role to play, but I think you'll see a resurgence from us as we lap through this last year.","Operator","Next question is from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you, I guess, characterize the type of competition you're seeing? Look, it's not a new concept obviously, we've heard that from a bunch of companies this quarter. Obviously, you've said you're promoting more but what do you see from competitors? I mean, is it your sense that this is just a momentary reaction to weaker volume in the near term? Or are you seeing anything that might make it sound or seem a little bit different from what you've seen in the past?","Donald R. Knauss","Well, I think let me start, Chris. I think there are a few things going on. First of all, why these categories in general, not just ours but across the CPG space, are fairly sluggish. And I think there are a few things obviously going on. We talked about the fragile consumer, the fact that wages are stagnant. We've talked about the fact that government assistance programs have been whacked back. We've talked about the horrible weather in the quarter, which obviously had an impact on GDP. I think the other thing is we've seen a spike in the number of people 18 to 34 living at home. I mean, 6 years ago it was 27% of people of that age group living at home with their parents, now it's 31%. We think there's about 1.5 million to 2 million households that haven't been formed that should have been formed. You add up all those factors and I think you get sluggish categories. So people are chasing volume. The other thing is you look at the volatility in emerging markets and the currency issues and people are refocused on the U.S. market and driving -- trying to drive growth in the U.S. market. So I think you put all those factors together, and you get kind of a perfect storm of events going on. And then if you look at the last year, the pattern in CPG for the previous 4 years had been a fairly good consistent pattern of pricing and volume was kind of sluggish to declining. Now you're seeing volume and pricing almost matching up with each other because people are chasing that volume. And I think that's more of a temporary phenomenon than not, hopefully as we see the economy pick up. But we are seeing that there's such a lack of pricing in the category because of all those other events that I mentioned. You've got a fragile consumer out there. So it's pretty tough. So I think that's what's going on.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","That helps and actually leads to sort of a follow-up, right. I mean gross margins, and I know there's only 1 quarter left in '14, but gross margins you're still looking for them to be modestly down. That's unchanged. But there's more pressure, right? And you guys obviously have said you're going to promote more, right. It sounds like pricing may be positive, but it's probably going to be less than you thought it was going to be and maybe that's wrong, but can you talk through that, I mean, your ability to sustain that gross margin guidance despite the fact that there seems to be more incremental drags than there are helpers to gross margin?","Stephen M. Robb","Yes. So for fiscal '14, as you say we're 3 quarters into it, and gross margins in the third quarter were down about 30 basis points. We would expect gross margins to be down modestly in the fourth quarter. I think the difference in fiscal '15 around gross margins is in commodity costs. Commodity costs are running well north of 1 point this fiscal year, fiscal '14. And as we look to fiscal '15, we think commodity prices are likely to continue to trend up but not at the level we've seen. And so then when you take the cost savings programs, call it 150 basis points, and you add to that the point of pricing and the other things that we're doing, it gives us some reason to believe that our gross margins should start normalizing and start building back again. And again, we'll have to get into the year and see how things play out from a commodity standpoint but that's the assumption we're working with at this point.","Steve Austenfeld","Chris, one other thing just to keep in mind is that the price increase we put through in Glad to help offset some of the commodity pressure that Steve just noted, that just went into effect in March. So we'll effectively get about a year's benefit of that going forward.","Operator","Next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So trying to dig a little bit deeper in this competitive environment that looks like it's gotten tougher. Clearly, you mentioned things like the macro environment. Are there other elements? So for example, do you guys have a sense of the manufacturing capacity utilization for the nonwoven, so for the Wipes, for resins, that's out there right now. Is that all driving some of this pressure?","Stephen M. Robb","Yes, I think it's probably more retailers looking to lean into private label as a way of getting a little bit more margin than it is excess capacity chasing the system based on what we know today.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then on that, so does it sound like -- you mentioned the price gaps in some categories up to 50%, that's not sustainable, totally makes sense. How much of that is you guys innovating over the years versus a quick change by the private label manufacturers and\/or the retailers and expanding it downwards? How much of it that you guys going up versus retailers taking the prices down in private label?","Donald R. Knauss","Well, it's interesting, Ali, where we've really seen private label focus is where we have branded shares north of 50%. So we look at Wipes, the most extreme pressure we've seen from private label has been in bleach, in Wipes and in Brita. And each one of those is a brand that has north of 50% share. And so when you have that kind of leadership share, I think that people really think that there certainly is a pricing or margin umbrella created, and I think that's where we've seen the most pressure. So we haven't seen that same level of pressure, for example, in salad dressing, where we even -- while we have a leadership brand, it's south of a 25% share. So it's really where we have these high share brands that we've seen the pressure, and I think sometimes \u2013 and seen in Charcoal as well with a 70%-plus share. So you think of all those businesses where we have those kinds of leadership shares, and I think you've just got to -- we've got to double down and be very prudent that we don't let that create a pricing or margin umbrella where people can crawl underneath them. But I think private label really focuses there because there's not a lot of other branded competitors to focus on. And so I think they obviously believe there's an opportunity there and certainly on the Wipes example and the 3-pack filter example on Brita and you look at lump and some of the other things that are going on in Charcoal with private label there, I think that's where you see the focus.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. So this is great because this is something you guys know I struggle with because those categories are where you also have your highest margins, and so effectively it's been...","Donald R. Knauss","I would stop you there and say that's not necessarily true, Ali. If you think about, all right, let's think about bleach, Wipes, Charcoal and Brita. Clearly, Brita has high margins. The other 3 are in the middle of the pack. Food has much higher margins. Burt's Bees has much higher margins. So we're not seeing it there. It's really more of the share position you have and the lack of other branded competition in those markets. And I think us just being -- needing to be much more watchful about keeping a pricing umbrella narrowed down so people can't crawl underneath it. And keeping the innovation up, keeping the innovation up so we continue to offer new offerings that people want to buy.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, and that's helpful. The question I did have on -- just separate question on professional. If you could give us an update on that it sounds like that was certainly a jewel in the crown that's growing for you guys for the CAGNY presentations and before that, how is that proceeding? How is the growth going in that category? And particularly from a margin perspective is it still holding in at above company or is it trending downwards? And if you could also mention because on the M&A discussion a second ago, you mentioned a lot of other core categories. Professional used to always be your #1 it sounded like, has that shifted a little bit from an M&A priority perspective?","Donald R. Knauss","Okay. On Professional, we expect another double-digit growth year out of that business, Ali. And we also expect that trend to continue in fiscal year '15. The margin structure of that is business actually accretive to the company margin structure. So we feel good about the margins in that business as well. I think that we just -- as you may recall, we talked about it at CAGNY, we just launched the UV light partnership. We think there's a lot of upside in some of these different channels and categories as we drive that business. So I think we remain very bullish on that business. As far as the -- I'll let Steve talk about the acquisition pipeline and the focus there.","Stephen M. Robb","Yes. And Ali, you know that one of the things that we really like about this business is the fact that when we look at a category, it's still fairly fragmented. So we think there's an opportunity to roll up some of the small family-held businesses. Certainly, we did that with AppleCare, HealthLink and then a few years ago obviously, the Caltech bleach acquisition, which has wildly exceeded our expectations since we acquired it, and I think we feel like we've got a healthy pipeline of bolt-on acquisitions ahead of us. It's going to take some time to shake these free. They don't always come in when you want. And sometimes you have to get into long-term discussions with people, which is what we're doing, but I think we feel very good about the M&A pipeline in Professional Products, and you'll see more activity there over time.","Donald R. Knauss","And we certainly -- at a 2.2 debt to EBITDA, Ali, as you know, we certainly got enough dry powder there if we need it.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Wanted to sort of continue the theme here, and Don, you have talked a lot about product preference as something that you're really focus on in terms of getting consumer -- in terms of getting your products to where consumers really prefer them. And I guess as we look at this, you've worked hard on that and yet is it just that the consumer has changed, and that's becoming less important? And therefore, you won't be able to charge the type of premiums that you think that product preference deserves? And then you also talked a little bit about the brand investment going up, can you talk a little bit about some of your marketing mix analysis? It's continued to come up over the years that your ad to sales has moved down, should we expect the continued shift from that standpoint more toward the trade promotion? And if we do see that, is that permanent price cuts or is that going to be just sort of hitting hard at certain points of the year where you know you need to drive that value equation?","Donald R. Knauss","Yes. Okay, John, let me take the second part of your question first. If you look at the incremental spend that we're putting in for next year, the majority of that spend is going into advertising and consumer promotion, not into trade. So we want to get comfortably back into the 9% to 10% range in total for the company and to get back near the 10% level for the U.S. Retail business. So that's what we're doing there. On the preference question, we still think that the 60-40 wins, the superiority of our products is extremely meaningful. I think where we got out of whack a little bit in the last year is these price premiums is only so much you can ask from a consumer especially in tough times. And I think that we did not, especially on high share brands, we did not stay focused enough on the price point delivery at the shelf. We also did not have packaging that was really hard hitting visually on what our benefit advantage is versus our competitors. At the end of the day, we've got to be able to -- as you know, we've got to be able to answer this fundamental question that consumers have. Why should I buy your brand in preference to that one? And I think while we've got great products in terms of 70-30 wins on Glad OdorShield, for example, and the same thing we have on Hidden Valley, if we let these premiums drift above 30%, we're asking too much especially in this environment. So I think we're going to continue that focus on 60-40 wins. We're going to continue to drive for price superiority, but we're getting to be damn sure that we've got these price points relevant to people where we're just not asking them to stretch too far.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then one sort of further follow-up on this. One of the things you guys have historically talked about is wanting to focus in categories with more private label. You talked about that strategically and I guess this kind of goes back to Nik's question, which is, is that still the right structure, the best structure for you guys to be in longer term? Those types of categories where you guys have big shares and with private label.","Donald R. Knauss","Yes. I still think it is, John. I think that we still would say that if you gave us a preference to competing against private label versus competing like in Home Care with 5 different national branded and International branded companies, I think it's -- we would say yes, we'd still want to compete against private label because -- not because they're easier, but because they have a more clearly defined unique role. We each have a unique role. We're the innovator, they're the opening price point. You get into a Home Care situation where you've got 4 or 5 other multinational companies, everybody's got the same role. So I think that we want that model. We think that model works, and I think we didn't build a 60% share 1.5 years ago in Wipes, a 60%-plus share in bleach and a 70% share in Charcoal and a leadership branded share in Glad because we can't compete with private label. We've done that very well, we just got to re-sharpen ourselves in terms of making sure the balance between product superiority and price point is right. And we're getting there. And I think bleach is a good proof point of that, I think you'll see the Wipes coming back in May and June and it'll be another proof point.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Is there any share repurchase in your 2015 guidance because as Don said, I know you're sort of at the low end of your debt to EBITDA range?","Stephen M. Robb","Yes. We're at about 2.2. So we certainly have dry powder for M&A, and we've got dry powder to be able to do share repurchases. What I would say is that certainly people should expect that in the outlook we're going to continue to soak up dilution from stock options. Going beyond that, I think we have to look at the M&A pipeline, and I think we just have to look at how much excess cash we build up. As we've said for many years, and I think as we've consistently done, if we build up excess cash that we don't need in the M&A environment, we'll go ahead and look for ways to get that back to the shareholders either through the dividend or through share repurchases. But at this point, there's a range of expected outcomes, and share repurchases are certainly one thing that we look at.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then as a follow-up to the M&A question, are there any opportunities for you guys to get bigger in sort of niche food categories? Because if you kind of look back the last 5 years probably the All-Star in the portfolio has been Hidden Valley. And you've done a terrific job extending it. I mean, is that something you'd kind of open up to be on like little small stuff like Soy Vay?","Donald R. Knauss","Yes, we would be open to that, Bill. And in fact, as you say, we know how to do and compete in that category quite well. I would classify that as down the middle of the fairway for us. So clearly that is something we would be interested in.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Are there any other sort of subcategories that you've targeted as being sort of complementary to the Hidden Valley business? Or is it too much detail?","Donald R. Knauss","I think for competitive reasons, I wouldn't want to get into that one, Bill. But clearly, where you're poking at is something that we have interest in.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got you. Great. And then just a last one, I know you still want 3 points of growth from innovation. I know you talked about the lightweight charcoal. But is there anything else you can talk about that can help drive that 3 points that's already been announced or is about to be announced?","Donald R. Knauss","Well, I think, yes, I think I'll give you another example. The lip crayons for Burt's Bees that are rolling out, we think it's quite a big deal actually. There's not a 100% -- that we're aware of, there's not a 100% natural lip crayon for women out there. And as you know, lipstick is such a huge category and the lip crayon continues to push that Burt's Bees brand into beauty away from just functionality. So we think there's a big opportunity there. I think obviously the lightweight litter we think is a big opportunity. The Aloha scent, excuse me, we just launched on Glad, which is doing extremely well, which is Procter & Gamble's #2 scent on Febreze, that carries over mostly into fiscal '15. And we could go through the list by brand. But I think you're going to see a pretty full package, across every major brand we'll have news. I talked about Brita earlier. Bleach, one of the things on bleach that continues to do extremely well and we're expanding this into new scents is the Splash-less part of our portfolio, is up over 3 share points. That's one of things that's driving our overall bleach share. So Splash-less has clearly resonated with consumers. Smart Seeking, it's a little early to tell. A lot of that's carry over to next year, but all these Smart Seeking and outdoor have added in about 1 share point plus already. So I think all in all, we're feeling pretty confident in the pipeline as we go forward.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And if I can just sneak in one quick other one, kind of to John Faucher's question. When you look at the kind of basis [ph] testing before you guys do these launches, are you seeing that once you launch them that the results are materially worse in this environment than they were sort of prior to this consumer malaise?","Donald R. Knauss","I'm trying to think of an example, Bill, that would be even worse or much better. I can't -- I think that the models are still fairly predictive because -- and I think the reason is if you look at the category growth, now this quarter was a bit of an anomaly given, we grew 0.4% all our categories but the categories were negative 1.8% in February because of the weather. If you look at the fiscal year-to-date our categories are growing 1%. I mean, the historical average is 1% to 2%. So it's nothing like there's some massive deceleration in these categories, they're softer. And we're assuming kind of flat to up 1% next year, but I don't think there's anything dramatic going on. So I don't want to read too much into it. We haven't seen anything in the predictive models on any of the major launches that we've done that would say they're way out of whack.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","All my questions have been answered.","Operator","We'll move next to our question from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","I would like to revisit this issue of the relationship with the retailers. First, a clarification, we saw a drop in ad spending in the third quarter. There was a commensurate increase in trade spending in the third quarter is what\u2026","Donald R. Knauss","Yes.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","There was?","Donald R. Knauss","Yes.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Okay. So then the question is if you can, to the extent that it's not confidential, talk about what exactly was the point of the retailer when you lose distribution for the Wipes you having 80% share? I would like to understand what is the other side of the conversation, why is it that you couldn't get into an agreement that essentially didn't \u2013 avoided this loss of distribution? That is point number one. And point number two is trade spending overall it seems like there is an increase in the Laundry aisle, there is an increase in Litter because of innovation, and most of these monies are not seen by the consumer. So is this a new normal that essentially the retailers are asking more money just to put the same products on the shelf?","Donald R. Knauss","Yes. On the first question, let me see how I can answer this for you, Javier. I think what we saw in that case was an offering from a competitor that was on a cost per wipe basis. We thought that we could not replicate that price for other customers. And while we wanted certainly to maintain distribution in that customer where we had been for over a decade and had been doing quite well obviously, being the lion's share leader in share in general, we thought competing at that price level, particularly in a category where there is only 50% household penetration, we thought that was the wrong strategy for that category. And we also thought, as I said, that we could not deliver that price point to other customers. And we are a fair and equitable company in terms of allowing everyone to compete. So we just didn't think we could make it work, and we thought it would have channel repercussions that would be serious that we wouldn't be able to deal with. And we also thought it was wrong in terms of the dynamics in the category, that you didn't need to push pricing that low for a product that was on trend and had only 50% household penetration. So we chose not to go that route and told our story differently at other retailers, and that's why we're picking up distribution at other retailers. So that's to question number one. We thought it was the wrong strategy. On your second question, we have not seen an increase, that I'm aware of, in any of our top 20 customers in terms of slotting fees or any other incremental costs. Haven't seen any of that. I think people are getting even more and more everyday low cost, every day low price, pushing money into cost of goods as most they can. Certainly we have, in our top 20 customer set, high\/low competitors, as well as everyday low price competitors. But I have been out with 4 retailers the last 3 weeks across the country, 4 different major retailers all in our top 20, and that has not come up at all.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","And as a follow-up, in the case of the Laundry aisle, Church & Dwight did say that they're going to increase a slotting fee or spending in trade in the trade.","Donald R. Knauss","Yes.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","And my understanding is, is that there is a situation also with Procter with regards to Tide Simply with some retailers. So to what extent are you getting kind of like hurt in the crossfire or not? I mean, that, I mean, for your Laundry additives?","Donald R. Knauss","Yes. We haven't really seen that, Javier. We're not really -- as you know, we don't really play much in that aisle. Well, certainly not in detergent, but the Laundry additives seem to be a separate deal, and we certainly have seen no bleed over into the bleach section. In fact, I think one of the reasons our shares are back to over 60% is we are now back to historical levels on merchandising and we're actually starting to see Household penetration decline slowing in bleach now, and dosing seems to be at the right amount. So we're not seeing that kind of effect in our segments.","Operator","Our next question comes from Leigh Ferst with Wellington Shields.","Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields & Co., LLC, Research Division","I also wanted to ask about the Professional Cleaning business, and I'm wondering if the infection rates are going down at the hospitals and other facilities and if not if that's still an opportunity for you? And if healthcare reform is helping drive demand?","Donald R. Knauss","Yes. Leigh, on the first part of the question, clearly, the 100,000 people dying every year from hospital-acquired infections is not really moderating very much, at least we don't see a discernible trend down. We do see -- in fact, last night, I was watching NBC Nightly News and they had a segment on about MRSA and MRSA killing itself I think, it was over 23,000 people last year. So that opportunity, that issue of public health is still front and center with infection control people across acute care facilities in this country and other countries. So that continues to be a very important opportunity for us and really a really important public health issue that we could help resolve. We have seen, in tests that we've done, for example with the Mayo Clinic, where we have greatly reduced those infection levels using our products and the protocols that we recommended. So clearly, bleach is the most inexpensive and effective disinfecting agent against all those bad bugs. So that we feel good about.","Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields & Co., LLC, Research Division","And is healthcare reform helping and are the protocols being followed?","Donald R. Knauss","Yes, I think it's a little early to tell on that one. I think -- I'm not sure that the healthcare reform is going to materially affect that business one way or the other. I would say that one of the things that has happened under the Obama administration about 3 years ago is federal government Medicare changed the -- changed their policy that they will not -- they won't reimburse hospitals for preventable injuries, right. And they classified these acquired infections as a preventable injury. So clearly, the folks who have to deal with these protocols and infection control in hospitals are much -- even more focused on it now because of the expense of one of these, not to mention somebody potentially dying is massive. So none of that has changed, and so I think it's a very fertile opportunity for us.","Operator","Your final question comes from Erin Lash with Morningstar.","Erin Swanson Lash - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could speak a little bit about the Burt's Bees business, and I apologize if I say this wrong, but particularly within the context of how gud is performing relative to Burt's Bees in that sort of mix?","Donald R. Knauss","I'm sorry. I didn't hear the last part, Erin.","Erin Swanson Lash - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just within the context, and I apologize if I say it incorrectly, but within the context of how gud is performing or gud is performing relative to Burt's Bees.","Donald R. Knauss","Right, I got you. Well, Burt's, over 90% of our personal care business is obviously Burt's Bees. Burt's is continuing to perform extremely well. I think this will be our fourth year in a row, assuming we continue on forecast for the fourth quarter, our fourth year in a row of big double-digit growth for Burt's. The International business now doing extremely well, north of 25% growth. gud is challenged. It's a very small piece, as I said, of the business. The shampoos and conditioners seem to be hanging in there fairly well. I think distribution is challenged on the other items in that business. But clearly, Burt's is the engine that drives our personal care business and with the innovation we have coming like lip crayons, we're very bullish about FY '15 for Burt's Bees.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Knauss, I would now like to turn the conference back over to you.","Donald R. Knauss","Yes. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call. I would like to just say this, I would like our investors and all of you folks who cover this company to understand that we are focused on 3 things like a laser, and I wish you'd take these away. And that is first, the value propositions of our brands and our categories is centermost in our minds. And I think the 1 point of incremental spending we're putting in next year is testimony to that. And all of that spending is going to be oriented around the guiding principle of never give consumers a reason to choose another brand. So that's number one.","Number two, we're going to ensure that our cost structure is as lean as possible to provide additional fuel to reinvest in growth. So I think you all know that we have quite a track record on cost savings, and we will redouble our efforts there to ensure we've got the fuel for growth. And third, we're going to ensure that our people, who we think are the best in the business, that they can and are able to focus only on the work that the consumer is willing to pay for and get rid of a lot of this other extraneous work that doesn't really add value to the consumer or to the customer. So we're going to focus on those 3 things. Certainly, better days are ahead. But with that focus, we believe we can not only deliver on the FY '15 expectations, but hopefully in our investors' mind and yours exceed them. So with that, we look forward to talking to you in August. Take care.","Operator","And thank you, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation."],"5209":["The Clorox Co.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Steve Austenfeld, Vice President of Investor Relations for the Clorox Company. Mr. Austenfeld, please, you maybe begin your conference.","Steven Austenfeld - The Clorox Co.","Great. Thank you. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining Clorox's First Quarter Conference Call. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, Clorox's Chairman and CEO, and Steve Robb, our Chief Financial Officer. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com.","Let me remind you that on today's call we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures including but not limited to free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures, determined in accordance with GAAP, can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the financial results area of our website as well as in our filings with the SEC.","In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release. Please recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.","So with that said, turning to our prepared remarks, I'll cover highlights of our first quarter business performance by segment. Steve Robb will then address our financial results and our updated EPS outlook for fiscal year 2017. And then finally Benno will close with his perspective as well as open up the call for Q&A.","So let me start with our top-line results. As this quarter's results highlight, the investments we've been making behind innovation and marketing continue to drive top-line growth, as we saw 8% volume growth in the quarter and 4% sales growth. And as we noted in August when we provided our initial financial outlook for fiscal year 2017, we plan to spend about 10% of sales in advertising and sales promotion this fiscal year, which is consistent with our spend level last year in fiscal year 2016.","It's also important to remember that this high level of support is consistent with our 2020 Strategy objective of spending more behind our brands. And as a result, in a number of our categories we benefit from a very high share of voice, meaning Clorox brands are often the only ones speaking to the consumer.","In addition, in the first quarter just ended we increased trade promotion spending at a double-digit rate versus the year-ago quarter, both to support defensive activities in a few key categories against some competitive brands but also in support of recent innovation. As a result, as noted a moment ago, first quarter volume was up 8% and sales were up 4%, which included about two points of growth from our Renew Life acquisition, which closed in early May.","Steve will talk in a moment to the specific drivers of sales growth. But big picture, it's worth noting that all of our U.S. segments grew sales in the quarter, as did our international business, on a currency-neutral basis. And importantly, this quarter's 4% sales growth was on top of 3% growth in the year-ago quarter. Additionally, our currency-neutral sales growth this quarter, which was 6%, was on top of 6% currency-neutral growth in the prior year's first quarter. So fundamentally, we feel our businesses are performing extremely well.","Now turning to market shares, our U.S. 13-week share in tracked channels \u2013 and I want to emphasize that this is only in tracked channels \u2013 decreased two-tenths of a point versus the year-ago quarter, ending at 23.6%. This modest share decline reflects continued competitive spending in a number of categories, including Brita, Glad and Cat Litter. But it is important to note that the tracked channel data I just cited does not reflect the significant gains we have had in untracked channels, including Home Care in the club channel; online sales across our entire portfolio, but in particular Brita and Burt's Bees; continued growth in our Professional Products business; and the great results we've seen in Charcoal over the last few years in the home hardware channel.","Looking at category growth in the U.S., our categories were up about two-tenths of a point in the quarter, which is lower than our long-term planning assumption of 1% to 2% growth. In great part, we believe this is due to extensive promotions by competitors, which is restricting growth rates in some of our categories. In response, we remain focused on investing to drive category growth through innovation supported by marketing investments and with the intention of driving trial and awareness.","So with that, I'll review our first quarter results by segment. Starting with our Cleaning segment, first quarter volume increased 13% and sales grew 7% behind higher shipments of Home Care and Professional Products. In Home Care, which is our largest U.S. business, sales increased double digits. The gain was driven by growth in nearly all segments of our Home Care business, with Clorox-branded products performing particularly well as we continue to invest behind the total Clorox equity.","Clorox Disinfecting Wipes reflected record quarterly shipments, as volume was up double digits, and that was even beyond the recent club distribution gains we've discussed. Further, our toilet cleaning business also saw record volume. And broadly speaking, we saw great support by retailers behind back-to-school merchandising. Consistent with these results, Home Care achieved healthy market share growth in the quarter and has now achieved more than nine quarters of market share gains.","In Professional Products, we saw volume and sales growth across all segments of the business. And as in our retail business, Clorox-branded products are performing particularly well in both the professional cleaning and the healthcare portions of the business.","Turning to our Laundry business, sales declined in the quarter behind decreases on Clorox 2 Stain Remover & Color Booster. However, our bleach market share did increase in the quarter behind gains on our regular and Splash-Less sodium hypochlorite products. Splash-Less, which is margin accretive to our overall bleach lineup, is performing well and is growing household penetration, which is a key objective across the company's portfolio. This is a great example of leaning in on a margin-accretive product to drive profitable growth.","Looking at our Household segment, we delivered 6% volume growth and 3% sales growth, in great part reflecting the benefit of the Renew Life acquisition.","Starting first with Cat Litter, first quarter volume and sales both increased behind merchandising activity and the new Fresh Step with Febreze innovation we launched earlier this calendar year. And while competition in this category remains intense, we are pleased to have seen a second consecutive quarter of market share growth for the Scoopable Fresh Step franchise.","In Bags and Wraps, which is our Glad product line, volume was flat in the quarter, although sales did decline as we supported our brands with higher trade spending in an intensely competitive environment.","However, even with this quarter's sales decline, there are some areas of the business that are performing well. For example, we are continuing to see increases in our premium Glad OdorShield offerings. And as we've mentioned in the past, we continue to focus on driving profitable growth in the trash bag category. So we're pleased to see growth in this margin-accretive premium line.","Also, our premium food storage bags featuring Disney characters are doing extremely well and we are now extending beyond our initial offerings that featured characters from the popular movies Frozen and Cars to newly launched bags featuring Star Wars characters.","In the Charcoal business, sales declined but this was following a very strong fourth quarter in fiscal year 2016. Overall, the Charcoal team expects to build on its great run over the last several years, business remains fundamentally healthy and we look forward to the 2017 billing season.","And then lastly, results in the Household segment reflect the contribution of our newly acquired Renew Life digestive health business. For the quarter, it represented about 2% of total company sales but is also expected to grow very rapidly. While still early, as we've only owned the business for about two quarters, Renew Life is on track with our expectations, integration is going extremely well, and we have already realized some of the distribution gains we anticipated when we bought the business.","Turning to our Lifestyle segment, volume increased 1% and sales grew 2%. Within the segment, starting with our food business, volume was flat, reflecting very strong performance a year ago when shipments grew at a high-single-digit rate. However, in the quarter sales did increase behind reduced spending compared with a very large promotional event in the year-ago quarter.","Positively, market shares on our food business continue to be strong behind all segments of our bottled and dry dressings and our dip business.","Turning to Burt's Bees, volume and sales grew largely due to innovation across our lip portfolio, including lipsticks, tinted lip balms and our new strawberry-flavored lip balm, as well as behind incremental merchandising which supported our strong base business performance. We remain excited about our innovation plans for Burt's Bees as we look to continue to drive sales this holiday season, particularly behind lip balm and lip color.","Turning to our Brita water-filtration business, while volume was flat sales were slightly down in the quarter due to slowing sales of our Brita bottle offerings. Importantly, however, shipments of pour-through filters, which are really the core of our business, were up during the quarter as the brand continues to benefit from the great momentum we are building through our partnership with the reigning MVP of the NBA, Stephen Curry, of the Golden State Warriors. Behind ongoing marketing, PR and future innovation, we continue to believe this business will improve over time.","And then lastly, looking at our international business, volume for the quarter increased 4%. From a sales standpoint, international was flat, which we believe is a really solid result recognizing the continuing negative foreign currency exchange rates.","Essentially, we were able to offset foreign currency headwinds through price increases as well as investments we made in certain markets, such as in Canada with the Renew Life business and our Burt's Bees business in Asia. Because of these actions, sales for international, excluding foreign currency, grew 10%. In addition, we continue to execute our Go Lean strategy across our international business, focusing on margin enhancement, which we view to be particularly important, given our belief that foreign currency headwinds will continue through the fiscal year at roughly the current level.","So to wrap up, although just 90 days into the fiscal year we are very pleased with our top-line performance. Importantly, despite the continuing challenges of unfavorable foreign currency, our top-line expectations remain unchanged. We continue to anticipate sales growth of 2% to 4%, or 4% to 6% on a currency-neutral basis.","Now I'll turn it over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our Q1 performance as well as our outlook for fiscal year 2017.","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. We're pleased to start the fiscal year with another strong quarter of volume and sales growth, supported by ongoing investments behind our brands. And importantly, I feel good that we're on track to deliver solid sales and earnings growth for the fiscal year.","Turning to our financial results for the first quarter, Q1 sales grew 4% on top of 3% growth in the year-ago quarter, reflecting nearly eight points of volume growth, including the benefit of the Renew Life acquisition, and more than one point of benefit due to pricing actions in our International segment. These factors were partially offset by a combined impact of about three points from unfavorable mix and higher trade spending and about two points of negative foreign currencies.","Gross margin for the quarter was lower than we anticipated, reflecting unfavorable mix, which came in a bit higher than expected. Specifically, gross margin for the quarter came in at 44.4% from 45% in the year-ago quarter, when notably the company delivered 220 basis points of gross margin expansion. The 60 basis point decrease reflects 140 basis points of cost savings, 90 basis points of favorable commodity costs and 70 basis points of pricing in International.","Our gross margins also reflect 220 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs, driven by inflationary pressures, and strategic investments to continue growing our brands and maintain our cost-savings pipeline. For example, we closed our Chicago bleach manufacturing facility earlier this year as a part of our ongoing productivity efforts to optimize our supply chain. Other negative impacts on gross margin in the quarter included 60 basis points of unfavorable mix that I mentioned and about 50 basis points of negative currencies.","At 13.9% of sales, selling and administrative expenses increased about a half a point versus year ago and primarily due to the impact of the Renew Life acquisition and increased performance-based compensation costs. For perspective, excluding the impact of Renew Life, selling and admin came in at 13.7% of sales, and we continue to anticipate fiscal year selling and administrative expenses to come in below 14% of sales.","Advertising and sales promotion as a percentage of sales was essentially flat versus year ago, while our U.S. retail spending came in at about 10% of sales, reflecting continued support behind our brands.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 32% versus 34.5% in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was driven mainly by a 2 percentage point benefit to the company's effective tax rate in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from the adoption of a recently issued accounting standards update. As previously communicated, the benefit realized from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 could vary significantly given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future share-based transactions. And while this year's first quarter tax rate was lower than year ago, it was higher than we expected, as first quarter option exercises were well below those in the year-ago quarter and historical levels.","Net of all of these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.36, an increase of 3% on top of a 20% increase in diluted earnings per share in the year-ago quarter. First quarter net cash provided by continuing operations was $170 million compared with $135 million in the year-ago period. The year-over-year increase reflects higher tax payments in the year-ago period.","Free cash flow, defined as net cash from continuing operations less capital expenditures \u2013 which came in at $59 million this quarter \u2013 was $111 million, or 7.7% of sales. For the full fiscal year, we continue to estimate free cash flow as a percentage of sales in the range of 10% to 12%.","Now turning to our fiscal year 2017 outlook, we continue to anticipate sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%, reflecting our unchanged assumptions for growth and continued investments in innovation. Excluding the anticipated negative two-point impact from unfavorable foreign currencies, we continue to expect fiscal year 2017 sales to grow between 4% and 6%.","Turning to margin, we now anticipate gross margin to decrease modestly versus our previous assumption for gross margin to be about flat, reflecting firming commodity costs and somewhat greater pressure from unfavorable mix. While we benefited from lower commodity costs in the quarter, as previously communicated we continue to anticipate commodity favorability to dissipate as we go through the fiscal year.","We continue to anticipate fiscal year EBIT margin expansion in the range of 25 basis points to 50 basis points, with growth expected to be seen later in the fiscal year from lower selling and administrative expenses, driven by ongoing productivity initiatives and more normalized levels of performance-based incentive compensation costs.","In addition, we will be lapping a number of items, including one-time integration costs related to Renew Life acquisition and distribution expansion of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes in the club channel.","Now we'll turn to our fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. As noted in our press release, we now anticipate our effective year tax rate to be between 32% and 33%, reflecting a two-point reduction versus year ago from adopting the accounting standards update, compared to the previously anticipated four-point reduction.","As I just mentioned, there is an inherent uncertainty in predicting future share-based transactions and our updated outlook for the fiscal year effective tax rate reflects the lower-than-anticipated exercises of Clorox stock options in the first quarter and the company's revised outlook for the full-year stock option exercises. Moving forward, we continue to anticipate more variability in our quarterly and annual tax rates as a result of adopting this updated standard.","Net of all of these factors, we now anticipate fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.23 to $5.43, which reflects our updated assumption of $0.10 to $0.15 of benefit from the adoption of the accounting standards update versus the prior assumption of $0.25 to $0.30.","Importantly, excluding the impact of the updated accounting standard, we continue to anticipate fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.13 to $5.28.","In closing, we are pleased with our start to the fiscal year. We're growing sales on top of strong sales growth in the year-ago quarter. And as we look to the remainder of the fiscal year, we'll continue to drive the following priorities. First, we'll stay the course in investing strongly behind our brands to drive our innovation programs and defend against competitive activity we are seeing in select categories.","Second, we plan to step up our productivity and cost-savings programs to support our margins in the U.S. and in international in light of ongoing inflationary pressures impacting manufacturing and logistics costs and our expectations for firming commodity costs.","Finally, we remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders over time. I am pleased with our near-term actions to support this commitment, including increasing capital expenditures in the first quarter behind growth and cost-savings opportunities.","Importantly, despite these investments, we continue to believe that we'll deliver fiscal year free cash flow in the range of 10% to 12% of sales. Bottom line, we'll continue to invest behind our brands, focus on the long-term margin expansion and deliver against our 2020 aspirations.","And now I will turn it over to Benno.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Thank you, Steve, and hello, everyone. Here's what we hope you will take away from today's call. First, we are very pleased with the continued strong top-line growth, particularly in an environment where growth is so hard to come by. The key focus for Clorox remains driving good growth \u2013 growth that's profitable, responsible and sustainable for the long term. Driving good growth is important because it means we're winning with the consumer. We're winning with the customer. We're running an operation that is effective and efficient, and we're creating shareholder value.","We've been keenly focused on doing just that through innovation, distribution expansion and incremental demand-building investments behind our brands. We have significantly increased our marketing support across digital, trade promotion and other marketing mediums to nurture our growth brands and drive our right to win. And our strong Q1 growth on top of strong year-ago growth is the direct outcome of this deliberate and strategic approach.","Second, in the midst of an intensely competitive environment we have momentum on our brands and we're staying the course. In the U.S., our business is healthy and we intend to continue driving it by offering superior value to consumers supported with excellent retail execution, which is something that's a hallmark for us. Notably, and very consistent with our strategy, we are particularly pleased to have completed Q1 with more than two-thirds of U.S. net customer sales growing household penetration. Increasing household penetration is a strong indicator of healthy business growth.","In international, we're staying the course. We're stemming headwinds from foreign exchange and inflation with our Go Lean strategy. We're taking a long-term view of the business to improve profitability while making select investments in key growth markets. And I feel very good about the future of our international business, recognizing the fundamental strength of our brands in many countries.","Finally, we are taking a long-term view to invest in growth that is profitable and sustainable and to continue to deliver strong ROIC and cash flow to create long-term value for our shareholders. Examples include that we are investing in value-added innovation and have a robust collection of launches teed up for the second half of this fiscal year. We also remain focused on smart investments with solid ROIs, ensuring our demand-creation dollars work harder for us every year. We will continue our focus on productivity and cost savings to fund our investments, improve our margins and reduce selling and administrative expense. And while only a few months in, we feel very good about our Renew Life acquisition and the opportunity we have to make a difference to the business through our 3D brand-building capabilities and through the brand scalability and distribution expansion potential.","And with that, let's open it up for your questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Dorer. Our first question comes from Wendy Nicholson of Citi.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good afternoon. Could you talk about one of the comments you said at the beginning, Steve, was category growth was unhealthy, in your words I think, due to the higher level of promotional activity. But can you talk about how that is driving volume or velocity, if you will, among those categories? Because I guess what I'm wondering is, number one, if oil prices are headed higher, what do you expect? Or have you started to see any changes in that competitive activity? But number two, do you think there has been pantry stocking on the part of consumers because there hasn't been so much promotional activity? Just if you could talk about that comment maybe a little bit more that would be great.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah, Wendy, this is Benno. Just to put it in perspective, as Steve noted, category growth was somewhat lower over the last 13 weeks due to the promotional activity that we're seeing. Recall that commodities were still somewhat of a tailwind for us this quarter and therefore it didn't surprise us to see promotional activity across several of our categories, in particular perhaps Glad Trash and the Disinfecting Wipes to be higher and depress that category growth somewhat. We did not see any particular pantry stocking, so that's, again, I expect that this promotional activity is going to subside over time as we expect commodities costs to firm up later on in the fiscal year. And what Steve also did was to point towards the particularly strong growth that we've seen in non-tracked channels.","So again, this is an example where category growth in tracked channels really just tells part of the story of what's happened this quarter, given that we've seen such outsized growth on a number of our brands in non-tracked channels. And Steve mentioned some of those and they include but are not limited to Disinfecting Wipes, Brita, Burt's Bees. So we're feeling good about the total top-line momentum that we have, as is evidenced by the strong volume and sales growth in the last quarter.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","It just strikes me as strange that category growth is lower than you would expect because there is a higher level of promotional activity. In other words, the discounting or the price promotions are that high that it's not being compensated for by higher volumes. That's just intuitively \u2013 usually, there's an acceleration in category growth when there's a lot of promotional activity.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah, recall, Wendy, that a lot of our purchases in categories that were in routine purchases, so people are not necessarily buying more trash bags or buying more bleach just because it is on sale. What it therefore does do is keep volumes somewhat unchanged and depress the sales growth. And that's exactly what we've seen in tracked channels. It also gives us certainly ammunition to continue the conversations that we have with retailers that price promotion, as we've noted to you and certainly to retailers in the past, don't really add value in our categories. And that over time we expect the promotional spend in our categories to subside and our competitors to return to perhaps more rational behavior that drives our categories the right way, which is certainly something that we're focused on. And the right way means investing in our brand equities and investing in value-added innovation.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Fair enough. And then just the second follow-up question I had is on Burt's Bees specifically. Can you remind us, the Lifestyle segment has been a little bit volatile over the last couple of quarters. When are you lapping the launch of lipsticks? Because I know that was a big deal for that brand. It's a small brand but still I think it was a big initiative. When are you launching that? And where are we in terms of how much more distribution is there for that product and brand extension, if you will? Thanks.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Lipsticks was launched in Q3 of fiscal year 2016, so take a little bit until that laps. But keep in mind that we are continuing to drive innovation on that business, and we certainly also have innovation planned for the back half of this fiscal year. Specific to your question on lipsticks, that continues to do very well. As we speak, we have started to do TV advertising for this brand, and the early returns are really strong. And we expect that initiative to continue to grow in its year two and year three post its launch.","We view cosmetics in general as a potential growth platform for the Burt's business, and we'll invest behind that. And lipsticks in particular has been very well received by consumers but also by the press. Notably, we've gained two lipsticks of the year awards by two leading magazines, Cosmopolitan and Allure, and consumers really follow the recommendations that publications like those two make. And we are feeling good about this launch and think that doing TV advertising as we're doing now is another down payment in the long-term success, not only of Burt's Bees cosmetics but the Burt's Bees franchise as a whole.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Terrific. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take another question, and that comes from Stephen Powers from UBS.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Great. First, you may have disclosed this somewhere and I just missed it, but on Renew Life can you just confirm that it was roughly a full contributor to both sales and volume in the quarter? And maybe in doing so highlight for us what volume growth was in Household excluding Renew Life?","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Yeah, so Renew Life contributed about two points to both volume and sales growth for the company as a whole. Turning to sales on Renew Life for the Household segment, it contributed about six points to sales growth for the Household segment.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you. And then pivoting to gross margins. You mentioned the negative mix and the commodity dynamics, but I wanted to focus also on the inflationary pressures impacting manufacturing and logistics. Was there any timing factor there, or should we expect that drag to continue at an elevated rate?","And separately, as you factor in competitive activity plus your own innovation pipeline, can you just frame a bit on the trade spending line over the balance of the year? It sounds from Benno's comments like perhaps we should expect it to remain elevated year-over-year in the nearer term and then perhaps tapering off towards the end of the year as you lap the investments of late 2016. I just wanted to make sure that was a fair read.","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Yes, so just starting with the trade spending, yes, we do plan to continue to invest in trade to kind of support the innovation, particularly our second-half innovation that we are pretty excited by. So those numbers will continue.","Regarding manufacturing and logistics, in the first quarter it is was about a 220-point drag on gross margin. Now, I would not have you project this forward for the full year because included in the 220 points, in addition to inflationary pressures in international and the U.S., which we do expect to continue, it also includes some one-time investments we are making behind our cost-savings programs and our growth initiatives. And to be specific, that's about 60 basis points. And we are feeling good about the investments we are making. We think they're going to generate nice returns going forward, but I think that number is a bit elevated in the first quarter just because of these investments we're making.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That helps a lot. And then maybe just stepping back, Benno, you mentioned at the end of your prepared remarks the increases in household penetration that you realized in the quarter. I was hoping you could maybe pinpoint which businesses were most incremental there. I'm assuming wipes, just given the growth that we saw, and Renew Life, given that it targets seemingly different customers in different channels from your core business. But were there any other businesses to call out in terms of where you are reaching new consumers and new households?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yes. For clarification, what I said is more than two-thirds of our U.S. volume or our U.S. net customer sales grew household penetration. And it's really broad-based, Steve. Notably it does exclude Renew Life because we do not know what the household penetration was last quarter \u2013 last year, sorry. But really, really broad-based with a skew towards our growth businesses, which is what you'd expect and also tells you that our portfolio momentum accelerator, which is to eventually invest in those businesses that have a stronger right to grow, is really paying off well. But broad-based, certainly Disinfecting Wipes continues to grow household penetration, but I would point out that the Clorox brand as a whole is perhaps the shining star here and that is not limited to Disinfecting Wipes but also includes toilet bowl cleaners and sprays.","We have grown our Clorox brand into four million more households over the last year and that is really unique in an environment like this when so many brands in our categories competitively are struggling to gain new households. So we feel good about our ability to connect with consumers based on innovation, based on the change in our marketing approach and the increased focus on digital and the investments that we are making in our brands with the particular focus also on offering superior value to consumers. So really broad-based and feeling good about that.","Broad-based, when I say that, maybe a last word, also does mean that it includes our fuel businesses. As you know, we have differentiated the way we classify our portfolio into fuel and growth businesses and we've seen notable household penetration growth also in our fuel businesses, which tells you that also fuel businesses have a right to grow and we're certainly focused on growth in those businesses as well.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for that. Appreciate it.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ali Dibadj from Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. So just to go back on a couple of things, top line and margins. If you go back to excluding obviously currency but also Renew Life and then also the expansion of wipes into Costco, just to kind of level set, Q1 growth would've been in the kind of 2% to 3% range? And can you give me the analogous number relative to your fiscal year 2017 2% to 4% range? So excluding the Renew Life, which you do, currency. which you do, but then also the Costco wipes expansion.","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Let me try to answer your first quarter question and highlight what we had previously communicated. So Renew Life contributed about two points of sales growth for the company in the first quarter, which was offset, by the way, with about two points of foreign currency. As it relates to Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, the incremental distribution at club, the net customer sales was less than a point. So nice contributor to the sales growth but certainly not the biggest contributor to the sales growth.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then according to your always helpful retail pricing actions, I guess disclosure in the press release, it doesn't look like you've actually taken any U.S. pricing since like February 2015. And a twist on the questions from earlier around trade spend, do you think you'll be able to take pricing up as input and manufacturing costs \u2013 granted, maybe less than we saw this quarter \u2013 but those kind of ramp up and then there's inflationary environment that's growing obviously in the commodities directly. Do you think you're going to be able to take pricing up to offset that? Or do you think it's going to be more difficult going forward? And depending on your answer there, on the other side of the operating margin story is obviously the SG&A bucket, which has been great. Right now it's below 14% is the target. How much more fuel is left on the tank there from a cutting-on-SG&A perspective?","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","So, Ali, you've got a couple of questions in here. Let me see if I can take each in turn. First, starting with pricing. Our fiscal 2017 outlook, as we'd previously communicated and this remains unchanged, we are taking pricing but it's primarily in our international business where we're seeing higher rates of inflation. And importantly, where we are taking the pricing, it's sticking in the market. I think longer term, we continue to believe we've got pricing power in our U.S. brand equities given the health of those brands and the investments we've been making. If inflation does in fact ramp up over the long term, I don't think we're afraid to take pricing to protect our margins. But at this point, it certainly wouldn't be our preferred option. And let's get through the next couple of quarters and let's just see what happens with some of the inflationary pressures.","Regarding selling and administrative expenses, we continue to believe that will come in below 14% of sales this fiscal year, really being driven by a combination of our productivity programs as well as more normalized levels of incentive compensation. And most of that benefit you will likely see in the second half of this fiscal year. So as we move through the fiscal year you should see that number come down. We've got plans in place to get that number well below 14% over the long term. So short answer is there's more runway there. It's going to take time, but we feel pretty confident in the plans we have there.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So \u2013 and this is helpful. And so to your former answer, which was on gross margin in particular, can you share your view on what we've been hearing, obviously, from retailers in the U.S.? So long-term commentary about more private label, clearly discussions about ALDI and Lidl coming to the U.S. much more aggressively, they're 90% plus private label, and what the impact is on your business. It has an impact on everybody, but an impact on your business in particular, given some of the categories \u2013 granted not all \u2013 but some of your categories are playing in that area where you say yourself you're the only share of voice out there. So does that shift that we expect over the longer term towards retailers that may be more focused on categories that are private label-prone like yours?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Well, Ali, I'm going to take that. First of all, I think where we're going to see that shift remains to be seen, yeah? So I would certainly say that we're watching that, but we'll have to let this play out. Again, I would point to our sales growth, right? So investing in our brands and investing in sales growth and making sure it's profitable is what it's about, and I think that's what we're doing particularly well. And we're doing that in categories that reasonably are flat more recently, and we have shown that we can grow 8% volume and 6% in currency-neutral growth in an environment where growth is very hard to come by. And that's because our recipe continues to be to invest in our brands. Our innovation is, as you know, margin-accretive, and we have a lot of innovation out there right now and particularly a robust innovation program in the back half.","So for us, as we look at the pricing environment and the retail environment, it's frankly relatively stable. And what retailers continue to want is growth, and they want growth the right way. And that's what we're delivering for them, which is why as you look at assortment, shelving, merchandising, in-store, we're winning the game with retailers right now. And we're investing for the long term to continue to do that.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks very much for the perspective.","Operator","Our next question is from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Hello. I was hoping to talk a little bit about Renew Life. You mentioned getting some early distribution wins. What types of retailers those are in, if it's mainstream or still kind of more the natural type channel? And also, you made a point of discussing how much it contributes to this quarter's growth, but that it's growing very quickly. So should we assume that the contribution to total company sales growth actually grows through the year? Thanks.","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Lauren, let me take the first part of that question. Again, as we've said, we think Renew Life will contribute about two points to sales growth for the full year, and it certainly did that in the first quarter. I think over the next couple of quarters you'll see something fairly consistent. It is a nice-sized business, but it's not the largest business in the portfolio. So while it is growing nicely and it's very much on track, I'm not ready to say it will accelerate the growth rate in the short term. I think we need to get through the integration, start driving the distribution build-out, all of which we have plans to do.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","And on your distribution question, Lauren, so the first objective we certainly have is to maintain and build on the strength that the brand has and enjoys in the natural channel, and we are doing that well.","And then the second opportunity is to make stores and food, drug, mass, so our traditional strongholds retailers, where as a company we have very strong capabilities and a strong track record of success. We are doing a nice job to expand distribution there and we are starting to see the benefits of that. But by no means are we done with that, but we're certainly pleased with the progress. This business is doing exactly what we hoped it would do. We are starting with distribution expansion. As time goes by, we will then plug in our marketing and innovation machine and we are certainly looking very closely at the international business as well.","One example that Steve Austenfeld mentioned earlier was the really noteworthy growth we've had in the Canadian business and we think that there's a lot more to come. So this is a good acquisition for us that's on track and doing exactly what we hoped it would do for us.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. And then just one clarifying point on CapEx. I think, Steve Robb, you were clear in terms of manufacturing logistics, there are some one-time charges in there given that you're a GAAP reporter. But is that also the case for CapEx, the elevated level had to do with some of these investments and plant closures and restructuring activity?","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","Absolutely. The incremental CapEx we're making is really to drive both the growth in the business but also importantly to drive the cost-savings program. And I think as we've said for many years, over the long term it will probably be very close to the level of depreciation and amortization, but we're not afraid to let that float up, either on the quarter or the full year if we see good investment opportunities, and this is exactly that. We let it float up on the quarter. It's likely it will be a bit higher this year than we've seen in recent years, and that's a good thing. It just means that we are finding good opportunities to invest behind. So you will continue to see us lean in to keep the cost-savings pipeline healthy and keep the top-line profitable growth going.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","And moving on we will hear from Olivia Tong from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. Just wanted to ask you about spending behind your brands. How nimble are you in terms of changing up the buckets of spending behind promotion and advertising? Because obviously you've kept your foot on the pedal on promotion, but ad spend was flat this quarter after a big increase in the second half of last year. So maybe could you first talk about that? And then in addition to the nimbleness question, do you think you have a better sense on ROI on your spend and perhaps can you give some examples as it pertains to a few of those categories, maybe wipes in particular? Thanks.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yes. So Olivia, the spend by quarter is certainly going to vary, so I wouldn't read too much into Q1. What we said is that for this fiscal year we think we have about the right spend and we expect advertising sales promotion to be in the 10% range, which is consistent with last year and certainly increased versus previous years. So feeling good about the ROI that we are getting across all of the buckets and have a really disciplined process in place that allows our businesses to measure ROI across all buckets including digital on at least a once-a-quarter basis and then shift dollars around.","And again, the best way for me to perhaps look at ROIs and show that the ROIs are really solid is to go back to the growth that we are seeing in so many of our businesses, which has really been broad-based this last quarter across all U.S. segments and even in international.","So feeling good about the ROI that we are seeing and, again, as mentioned perhaps also the past, we leave it to the general managers to decide where they want to spend based on where they see the ROIs. And that could mean that in the business like Burt's Bees we're investing in television because driving awareness behind initiatives like Burt's Bees lipsticks deliver strong return. On businesses like Cat Litter, we're investing in store to drive awareness behind the Fresh Step With Febreze innovation that's been working well for us in store. And then some other businesses like Hidden Valley and perhaps Brita we're spending the dollars more online, including e-commerce, and we're seeing really solid results there. So feeling good about the ability to be nimble and flexible and shifting the dollars to where we're seeing the ROIs. And again, I would point to the strong top-line growth as a proof point.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Got it. If we could dig a little bit more on the legacy Household business excluding Renew Life. It seems like Litter's getting a little bit better; Charcoal, the decline makes sense after the last couple of quarters. But it seems like we go back and forth on Glad a fair bit. So I get that the premium end is doing well, but when do you consider sort of paring back or rationalizing some of the non-premium businesses?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","So if I look at Glad, the volume's been flat after really several quarters of solid growth. And I'd also point to really a comp matter perhaps on that business because if you look at fiscal year 2016, the first quarter, we had a very strong quarter year ago with sales up mid-to-high single digits and profit up very significantly, very highly into the double digits. So I would look at perhaps the year-ago quarter as the main issue here. I certainly expect better results in the coming quarters.","As we've noted, competitive price promotions are depressing the category and perhaps also the share. And what we're focused on is being balanced here, certainly responding in kind and we're not afraid to invest in the defense of our brands where we think that's the right thing to do to set a strong signal to competitors that we're not letting them steal share at our expense by spending and price promotions. But we're staying balanced and we're staying focused on long-term profitable growth. So how you see that is that we certainly are accepting temporary share losses, in particular in the lower-profit and lower-price segment.","The good news is, as Steve Austenfeld noted, the OdorShield premium segment is still growing. We have strong innovation plans in place for the back half, and we expect the trade promotion activity to subside as commodities firm up over time in the back half. So if you look at this business over a longer period of time, perhaps the last 10 to 12 years, there have been these ups and downs, as you noted, Olivia. But if you look at the long-term trends, they've been very favorable and positive, and we know how to deal with situations like these where commodities are lower and competitive spend is elevated. But if history is a teacher, which we expect it to be, than this will subside and then our balanced and marketing and innovation-driven strategy will continue to succeed.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks, Benno. Appreciate it.","Operator","We'll go next to Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Good morning. Hey. Can you just drill a little bit more on this gross margin bridge for the year? So do you still expect gross margin to be roughly flat for the year? If you look at some of the puts and takes I guess, like the Argentina devaluation laps, so that probably helps the international business, but I was surprised that there wasn't more pressure from all that Costco volume because obviously Costco's a lower-margin customer. So was sort of curious if that gross margin on that Costco business in the wipes is accretive to the fleet average. And then I have follow-up as well.","Stephen M. Robb - The Clorox Co.","So Bill, couple of thoughts. So first of all, when we had originally come out with our outlook in August, we had thought gross margin would be about flat. As I said in my opening comments, we now anticipate gross margin will be down modestly on the year. Part of that reflects mix, which was a little bit less favorable than we had thought. In the first quarter, it was more unfavorable than we had originally expected. But the biggest change has to do with our expectations for resin prices, which we think are firming up a little bit quicker than we had originally anticipated.","So at this point we think gross margin will be down modestly. It assumes commodity costs in total are about flat, so it will dissipate as we had thought. It assumes that we'll still have some drag associated with mix, which we've seen for some time. But importantly we feel very good about our cost savings. And I would also say that at this point we have got solid plans in place to deliver EBIT margin expansion of 25 bps to 50 bps for the full year.","And I would also just point out over the long term, keep in mind we're coming off of some very strong gross margins over the last couple of years, but I feel very good about our plans to expand gross margins and total margins over the long term behind our cost-savings programs, also as we lower our S&A costs over time, and as we've talked we've got pricing power. So we're comping a pretty tough number in the year-ago period at 220 basis points of gross margin expansion, but I think we're feeling pretty good about the plans we have in place both for the intermediate and long term.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Gotcha. So you're not going to touch the Costco question. Can just tell me what e-commerce growth was in the quarter and what it is as a percentage of total sales now and if you've make targets on them?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","As a total percentage of sales, Bill, it's about three points, even though, as we've noted in the past, it's much higher than that on selected businesses like Burt's and Brita and also the Professional business. We don't comment typically on specific growth rates on businesses like for any given quarter, but it continues to do very well as we invest and as we continue to win with customers, be it Amazon or be it Walmart.com or Staples.com.","We continue to be bullish about this business. As you know, we've been able to double the business over the last three years and we think we can at minimum do the same once again over the next three years and we are investing behind that.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","And will take a question from Joe Altobello from Raymond James.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you. Hey, guys. Just a question in terms of promotion spending. Just curious if you guys are seeing any discernible trend in spending between your tracked and your non-tracked channels?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","If you look at the non-tracked channels, it really varies category by category. Look, a lot of the non-tracked channels frankly tend to be less promotionally-driven, right? They tend to be more everyday low price, Joe. So it's hard for me to quantify this in numbers, but off the top my head what I would say is that there's less price promotion in the non-tracked channels. Think about non-tracked channels, e-commerce, home hardware, club, tend to be more everyday low price-focused.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","But in terms of the trend, that hasn't changed all in the last couple of quarters?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","To be very honest, I would have to look it up. It's a level of detail that I would need to look at. I mean, certainly I would expect that in channels where promotional spending happens that are non-tracked, I would think that we're seeing the same phenomenon in non-tracked channels as we are seeing in tracked channels. It's hard for me to give you any highly qualified perspective on what specifically it was in those channels over the last quarter.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","No, that's fine. If it's not on your radar screen, it's probably not a major trend shift, I would imagine. I guess in terms of the wipes business, obviously you guys have taken some significant shelf space from a major competitor. I imagine that they are not taking that lying down. Have you seen them step up spending obviously beyond what you've talked about this morning but more so looking for gaining shelf space outside of the club channel?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","We've noted earlier, Joe, that Disinfecting Wipes is one of the businesses where we have seen more competitive price promotions. I will tell you, though, that this is a business where we are continuing to win in club and beyond and the best way to express that is in the strong share growth that we've seen in the category over the last quarter and the double-digit sales growth that we've seen even beyond the specific club retailer that you alluded to.","So we are winning because we are investing in gaining household penetration, which is working well. We're investing in marketing dollars and we are by far the leading investor in brand equity type of channels in this category. And we continue to invest in innovation, which has been very successful, in particular Clorox Disinfecting Wipes with Micro-Scrubbers continues to do very well and keeps growing. So it's a fortress of ours, and we're defending the fortress and we're growing it. And we're winning in the marketplace in club and beyond.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","And this concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Dorer, I would now turn the program back to you.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah, thank you. In closing, we're very pleased that our investments continue to drive momentum and growth in the first quarter on top of the strong growth we enjoyed a year ago. We remain confident in our strategy and the health of our core business, and we remain focused on making investment choices that are right for the long term.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Steve Austenfeld, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Mr. Austenfeld, you may begin your conference.","Steve Austenfeld","Great, thank you. Welcome, everyone and thank you for joining Clorox's second quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, Clorox's Chief Executive Officer; and Steve Robb, our Chief Financial Officer. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet, and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our Web site, thecloroxcompany.com.","Let me remind you that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including, but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt-to-EBITDA and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures, determined in accordance with GAAP, can be found in today\u2019s press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the Financial Results area of our Web site as well as in our filings with the SEC. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today\u2019s earnings release.","Please recognize that today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.","Now turning to our prepared remarks. I'll cover highlights of our second quarter business performance by-segment. Steve Robb will then address our financial results and financial outlook for fiscal year '15. And finally, Benno will wrap-up our prepared remarks as well as open it up for Q&A. Consistent with today\u2019s press release all of our commentary today is on a continuing operations basis, unless otherwise stated.","Turning to our top-line results. In second quarter, volume was up 4%, and sales grew 3%, including the impact of three points of unfavorable foreign currencies with the largest impact coming from Argentina. Excluding the impact of foreign currencies sales grew 6%. Our growth reflects higher volume as well as a nearly two point benefit from price increases. Importantly, our sales results reflect strong performance across all U.S. segments and international on a currency neutral basis.","In Q2, our U.S. 13-week market shares decreased one-tenth of a point versus the year-ago quarter. The slight decline in the quarter reflected continued intense competitive activity in our Cat Litter and Brita businesses. Inversely, we saw market share improvements in our Laundry business with Clorox Liquid Bleach and Clorox 2 Stain Fighter & Color Booster at two year highs.","The Homecare category also continues to strengthen. For eight consecutive months we've grown market share on this business with strong second quarter gains in Clorox Disinfecting Wipes leading the way. Burt's Bees also grew market share in the quarter with very strong gains in face and lip care.","Looking at our U.S. categories, they were up just over a point in the second quarter. A nice improvement following the half point gain we saw in Q1. We're continuing to invest to improve our category trends and strengthening our market shares remains a top priority.","With that, I will review our second quarter results by-segment.","In our Cleaning segment, Q2 volume and sales each increased 3% behind strong results in our Professional Products and Homecare businesses. Our Professional Products business delivered 21% volume growth and 19% sales growth behind double-digit shipment gains in Professional Cleaning and Healthcare along with a solid gain in Food volume. While concerns about Ebola and Enterovirus had limited impact on our Retail business which I will discuss in a moment healthcare institutions did respond with significant purchases of cleaning and disinfecting products contributing to top-line growth for the quarter. Volumes of strong sales in Q2 we anticipate some slowdown in Professional Products in Q3 as these concerns have now abated.","In Homecare which is our largest U.S. business unit, sales increased behind strong execution on several merchandizing events, along with distribution gains for our Toilet Cleaners. The solid volume in sales growth more than offset a distribution loss on Clorox Disinfecting Wipes at a major club customer last calendar year, a loss that we've now anniversaried beginning this month. In the near-term, we don't anticipate getting distribution back at this customer. For prospective, our focus is on profitable growth for Clorox and Category Health, not growth at any cost. We believe we have the right strategy in place to drive our business and category growth in a profitable manner. In particular, we continue to believe there is opportunity for increased household penetration in the wipes category, particularly as we launch meaningful innovation.","For example, we recently launched several new products including our wipe with Micro-Scrubbers it is consumer preferred versus those currently in market. As well as new Clorox Triple Action Dust Wipes that allow consumers to dust an entire room with one extra large wipe that picks up dust, hair and allergens such as pet dandruff. Importantly, as part of our strategy to expand wipes usage around the home, we also introduced Clorox ScrubSingles kitchen pads which come preloaded with Clorox cleaner and are meant to be tossed after use, thereby eliminating one of the most germ laden items in households, the reusable sponge. There is a version of ScrubSingles for use in bathrooms as well.","As we shared with you before Clorox remains the clear leader in the wipes category, with market shares near 50% in tracked channels, more than twice that of the nearest branded player and sheer trends have continued to improve. Early in the quarter we did see an uptick in wipe shipments heading into the cold and flu season behind consumer concerns regarding Ebola. But heightened consumer demand moderated quickly as reported cases dwindled. With the flu season just now getting into full swing, we will be monitoring consumption and using regional flu data to work with retailers to help target disinfecting wipe shipments where they are needed most.","In our laundry business, sales declined due to decreased Clorox Bleach volume as a result of category softness compared to strong category growth in the prior year. From a market share standpoint our investment in this brands and focus on value are paying off as December marked the fourth quarter consecutive quarter of market share growth on Clorox Bleach. Looking ahead, due to increases for input costs to our Bleach business we're in the process of implementing a 7% average price increase effective February 1st.","In our Household segment, we delivered 3% volume growth and 5% sales growth. The segment\u2019s top-line results were driven by strong performance in our Glad and Cat Litter businesses. Our Bags and Wraps business grew volume 3% driven by innovation behind our Hawaiian Aloha Scent as well as new Gain Scented Trash Bags through our partnership with Procter & Gamble. Sales on Glad were up double-digits behind price increases taken in 2014.","Even in the face of intense competition Cat Litter volume and sales increased behind distribution growth of our new Fresh Step Extreme Lightweight product. We continue to invest aggressively in innovation and communicating our value proposition versus the competition, particularly focusing on excellent clumping and odor control, such as with our new Eliminate Odor for 10 Days campaign that was launched in the second quarter. Keeping in mind that Q2 is a relatively small quarter for our Charcoal business sales and volume declined following double-digit growth in the first quarter as retailers transitioned to our new and improved Kingsford Charcoal product that launched in January in advance of the 2015 growing season.","In our lifestyle segment volume grew strong 5% and sales increased 4%. These results were driven by very strong double-digit volume and sales growth on Burt's Bees largely due to innovation in lip and face care products. In particular, our new lip crayons and new Vanilla Bean and Wild Cherry lip balm flavors grew strongly in the quarter supported by our first ever Burt's Bees television advertising. Our Facial Towelette business and skin brightening products were also very strong in the quarter.","Turning to our Food business, sales grew versus the year ago quarter behind higher volume for bottled and dry Hidden Valley products. Finally the segment\u2019s positive results in Burt's Bees and Food were partially offset by lower sales and shipments of our water filtration products primarily due to consumption declines on pour-through filters. As previously communicated, we started shipping an improved Brita filter in August that is faster and easier to change than competitive filters. In November, we began we shipping improved pitchers, with our focus on innovation we\u2019re optimistic that our Water Filtration business will have a stronger second half of the fiscal year.","Turning to International, volume was up 5% behind strong operating performance and volume growth in nearly all regions. However sales declined 2% due to the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates. If you exclude the impact of foreign currencies, sales for International grew 11%. With oil and other commodity prices having fallen capital investment in some countries has moderated resulting in slowing economic growth in some of our key markets such as Chile and Peru. Strategically, we remain committed to growing profitably in our international markets and continue to take steps to overcome macroeconomic trends such as negative foreign currencies, high inflation and slowing GDP growth. In particular, we continue to carefully assess spending across our International division and implement price increases to mitigate the macro headwinds.","Looking at the balance of fiscal year 2015, as noted in this morning\u2019s earnings release, we\u2019ve increased our sales growth outlook for the full year to be about 1%. The revised sales outlook takes into account the strength in the first half along with an updated outlook for the second half of the year. As I discussed, we anticipate some slowdown in Q3 in Professional Products following very strong Q2 shipments impart related to Ebola and Enterovirus concerns that have now greatly abated. In addition, we now anticipate stronger foreign exchange headwinds along with higher trade spending to support our categories and grow market shares, as well as defend against reduced prices by competitors following the decline in import cost.","Now I\u2019ll turn over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our Q2 performance and our outlook for fiscal year 2015.","Steve Robb","Thanks, Steve and welcome everyone. Well we\u2019re pleased to have delivered a second quarter and a solid first half for fiscal \u201915. In addition to strong sales growth in the quarter, we delivered another quarter of very good earnings growth. As you saw in our press release, we\u2019ve raised our fiscal year outlook for sales and earnings per share to reflect our solid first half results. In our second quarter, sales grew 3% reflecting four points of volume growth and two points from pricing, partially offset by three points of unfavorable foreign currencies. On a currency neutral basis, sales grew nearly 6%.","Our top-line results came in better than expected driven by strength in our Glad, Professional Products and Burt\u2019s Bees businesses. Gross margin for the quarter increased 10 basis points to 42.5% reflecting 130 basis points of cost savings and 100 basis points of pricing largely offset by 90 basis points of higher commodity costs as well as 90 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics cost reflecting continued inflationary pressures in International. And as we previously communicated we continue to see significant cost pressures in the logistics and transportation market due to the tight supply of trucks and railcars.","Selling and administrative expense was lower in the second quarter at 14.2% of sales compared to 15% of sales in the year ago quarter when the Company made incremental investments to change IT service providers. Cost savings also contributed to lower selling and administrative expenses. Advertising and sales promotion investment for the quarter was more than 9% of sales reflecting continued strong support behind our brands particularly to drive trial of new products. Notably, our U.S. retail advertising spend was about 11% of sales. Our effective tax rate of 34.9% was almost a point lower versus year ago, but in line with our full year projections. Net of all these factors, we delivered diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.97, an 8% increase versus the year ago quarter.","Fiscal year-to-date free cash flow was 207 million compared with 159 million in the year ago period. The increase was driven by lower employee incentive compensation payments, lower tax payments and the initial funding of the Company\u2019s non-qualified deferred compensation plan last year. These factors were partially offset by 25 million in payments to settle interest rate hedges related to the Company\u2019s issuance of long-term debt the expense of which will be amortized over the 10 year life of the debt.","In December of 2014 we issued 500 million in senior notes increasing the Company\u2019s quarter-end cash balance with proceeds subsequently used to pay down a portion of the notes that matured on January 15th of this year. For fiscal \u201915 we continue to anticipate free cash flow as a percentage of net sales to be about 10% of sales.","Now I\u2019ll turn to our fiscal year 2015 outlook, as Steve mentioned our fiscal year sales outlook now anticipate sales growth of about 1% reflecting solid first half sales results, product innovation and the benefit of pricing. Our sales outlook also now anticipates an even greater impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates in the range of 2% to 3%. In addition, fiscal year sales are anticipated to be impacted by slowing international economies as well as higher full year trade promotion spending as we continue to invest in our business and drive trial of new products. [Audio Gap] are expected to more than offset higher manufacturing and logistics cost.","Given the significant decline in oil prices we now anticipate lower resin prices in the second half and commodity costs are expected to be about flat for the full year. For fiscal year of 2015 we continue to anticipate selling and administrative expenses at about 14% of sales. EBIT margin is expected to be about flat, as incremental demand [Audio Gap] expansion. We continue to anticipate our fiscal \u201915 tax rate to be about 34%. And net of all of these factors we have raised our fiscal year outlook for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to $4.40 to $4.55.","As we look ahead to fiscal year 2016, we anticipate the benefits from continuing commodity softness to be partially offset by continued increases in logistics costs. Also, as we have done historically we may use a portion of the resin-related savings to address potential competitive price cuts. We will also closely track headwinds in international markets, including foreign currency declines and slowing economies.","Now before I turn it over to Benno, I did want to let you know that moving forward we will provide next year\u2019s fiscal year outlook starting with fiscal 2016 during our Q4 earnings call, which takes place in August. This change allows us to provide you with an outlook based on a full year of actuals and puts us more in line with the timing of our peer group\u2019s outlook announcements. I am happy to address any questions you might have on this process change, but I want to make you aware of this prior to the Q3 earnings release in May.","And with that I will turn it over to Benno.","Benno Dorer","Thank you, Steve and hello everyone. It\u2019s great to be joining you on my first call as Clorox\u2019s CEO given the strong second quarter we just completed. This quarter\u2019s performance follows a very solid Q1 and it also speaks to the commitment to the 2020 strategy and our focus on continuity with the leadership transition. That continuity of purpose is evidenced in our continued emphasis on category and overall market share improvement, profitably driving growth and stronger top-line performance and creating shareholder value.","Now clearly as we head into the second half, we are facing a number of challenges, including continuous softness in several categories, worsening foreign exchange headwinds, and slowing economies in many international markets. I believe we are taking the right steps to support our brands with increased investments, while driving margin improvement to grow profitably in this difficult environment.","And as I discussed with you on last quarter\u2019s call, the refining opportunity for Clorox is accelerating profitable growth. And looking ahead we are leaning into four key elements of our 2020 strategy that I believe drive the greatest value. These areas of emphasis which we are calling strategy accelerators will drive decisions around where we will invest more heavily. Again with intend to drive profitable growth. And I would like to take a few minutes to introduce these to you today. And at an Analyst Meeting we plan on hosting later this year, we will delve more deeply into how we are activating them.","The first area of emphasis is accelerating portfolio momentum. In other words, leveraging tailwinds to generate more growth from our portfolio and investing more heavily against those brands and categories that have a stronger right to grow. The second is accelerating 3D technology transformation, which aims to address increasing consumer fragmentation, the shift in how today\u2019s consumers shop and buy their products, and how we must engage with them to win the battle for the physical and virtual shopping carts.","The third area of emphasis is accelerating innovation. Now this isn\u2019t just about product innovation, it\u2019s about innovation in sales and marketing as well as product supply. Really anything that has to do with our demand creation model built around the three Ds of desire, decide and delight. Innovation in all these areas drives category growth, and we are committed to driving more of that. Finally we want to accelerate our growth culture while at the same time maintaining our tradition of operational excellence. We want to dial-up our strong Clorox culture to have an even more deeply ingrained growth mindset. I strongly believe these four areas of emphasis are what we need to drive growth, while doing so profitably. And I look forward to sharing more about them with you overtime.","Now with that let\u2019s open it up to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John Faucher","Want to talk a little bit about the pricing that you talked about, and I think you said it is going to come in on February 1st. Could you give us a little more of an idea -- and I apologize if I missed this -- where you are seeing that pricing going through sort of domestic versus international? And then given all the news about raw material deflation, et cetera, how you foresee competitive response on this pricing because we've seen a lot of talk about upticks and promotional spending going forward, so do you feel comfortable that the pricing is in and it is there to stay? Thanks.","Benno Dorer","I think what you\u2019re referring is the 7% price increase on bleach which is domestic liquid bleach. We have a profitable growth focus as you know and really these costs are fully justified. We\u2019re seeing cost inflation in several areas whether that\u2019s transportation, logistics, corrugates, wages benefits and these are costs that not just Clorox sees but these are costs that are visible and occurring to our competitors in private label as well. I would like to remind you that we\u2019re pricing to a long-term cost advantage and not to a peak and again these are fully cost justified. We do have a strong track-record in pricing so over the last 10 years 95% of our pricing increases has stuck they are based on the analytics as well. And we\u2019re in the process talking to our retailers as we speak, so based on that strong track-record and the cost justification, we are confident that this price increase will be successful. At the same time, we\u2019ll always monitor what will happen in the marketplace, what will happen with competition and we\u2019re certainly also willing to spend back if needed to defend the business.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo.","Chris Ferrara","I guess, Benno, can you talk a little bit about, I guess, the point one of the four points that you're saying you were leaning into, I guess, is accelerating portfolio momentum. Can you talk a little bit about how it is different, like what that might entail? Not necessarily specifics, but just generally what is different about that from what has been going on the last few years?","Benno Dorer","Yes, Chris. I think what this will be about is really identifying the businesses that have the strongest tailwinds and ensuring that we have the right investments behind them. And I think the growth of Burt\u2019s Bees in the last quarter is perhaps a good example of what this will look like. We have for the first time launched a TV advertising campaign because we realized that the awareness behind the brand really has a lot of upside on the base business even though the brand has been around for 20 years and that\u2019s been leading to really nice results on the base business. We are leading into the investments behind innovations more strongly and we\u2019ve really seen how lip but also face innovation has yielded really nice results last quarter. And finally we\u2019re working with retailers to make sure we have the right in-store support out there, so really it is helping us understand where those tailwinds are, investing in those tailwinds behind the portfolio like Burt\u2019s Bees and like certain areas in Homecare and like food enhancers and using that to drive growth but growth the right way.","Chris Ferrara","And just I guess on a near-term, you guys mentioned a couple of times that you are facing increasing tailwinds from economies around the world, but I guess that sort of leaves out your biggest economy where things look a little better and your category growth rate is getting better. So as you look forward, do you think generally your category growth rate globally across the portfolio is getting better or worse? I suspect that, right?","Benno Dorer","Well, if you look at our largest market internationally Chris Latin America we actually are experiencing a slowdown in categories which even effects some of our strong growth markets like Peru and Chile and other markets of course like Argentina and Canada have been more stable for awhile, so I would say the general trend that we\u2019re watching very carefully and International is a slowdown economically in our categories. Now our market share in International is growing and as you\u2019ve seen an 11% sales increase in local dollars is nothing to sneeze at, but that\u2019s a headwind that we\u2019re watching very carefully.","Chris Ferrara","And I am sorry I meant by your bigger economy I meant the U.S. which has been getting better, right?","Benno Dorer","Yes, in the U.S. what we\u2019re seeing is certainly in the second quarter we\u2019ve seen a slight uptick. Our categories grew a little over 1% and that\u2019s up 0.5 a point from previous quarter, so that\u2019s good. And if you think about what\u2019s happening here in the U.S., you see indications of an increasing consumer confidence the University of Michigan just issued their consumer sentiment index its highest since 2004. I believe there is hope that there perhaps will be higher consumer spends due to lower oil prices. So those are good things at the same time household formation is still lower than it historically has been. The jobs that are created still pay less than the jobs that were lost during the recession and there still is this bifurcation in society where the bottom half isn\u2019t really doing well. So there is puts and takes I would say we\u2019re cautiously optimistic. Our expectation right now still are based on flat to low single-digit category growth and for us we focus on what we can control and that\u2019s investing in innovation we have a strong innovation plan also going out in Q3 of this fiscal year that we're investing behind and we talked to you in the past about increasing our demand spend by one point of net sales. Overtime that\u2019s called for by our strategy and we\u2019re certainly leaning into that focus on delivering better value than competitors and private label. So we feel like we're doing what we can do to drive category growth but I would like to let this play out in the marketplace for a quarter or two it's really too early to call it a positive trend.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong","Wanted to ask you a question about competition in your cleaning categories, particularly as one of your main competitors is not domiciled in the U.S., we have seen in our channel checks a lot more deals with Lysol, buy two get one free, those kinds of things, so just curious on your take on competition in your cleaning categories, particularly as one of your main competitors does have a little bit of a tailwind from not being in the U.S.? Thanks.","Benno Dorer","Yes so competition in particular homecare Olivia has always been pretty strong and those types of deals that you described they are really nothing new, they occur relatively frequently and that\u2019s part of why we're saying that investing more in demand spending is the right thing to do. I will say though that for us the biggest category that we're competing with them in is wipes perhaps and if you look at the share results on wipes we're really up strongly in wipes and we feel like for us the right thing to do is focus on consumer fundamentals focus on demand spending that drives our brand equities on strong innovation and certainly in wipes we have a very strong innovation program and focusing on pointing out to the consumer that we're delivering superior value. That\u2019s really working in the marketplace that\u2019s what we'll be focused on and that\u2019s not to say that we won't respond appropriately if we feel like there is very strong trade promotion going on in the category we will defend our market shares. But I think we've always said that our focus is on earning market share and not buying market share and on wipes in particular that\u2019s playing out quite nicely at this point. So I would say the competitive dynamics in homecare are strong as they always have been. But I wouldn\u2019t call them elevated at this point.","Olivia Tong","And then on Glad, it doesn't sound like you saw any pushback on your pricing and interestingly it sounds like volume increased while you took pricing, which doesn't typically happen. So was there some timing issue? Was there a big pre-buy ahead of price moves or have you just managed to increase volume while also taking on price as well?","Benno Dorer","I would say the biggest thing on Glad Olivia is that we have certainly leaned into the price increase and merchandizing has been very strong last quarter. But also our innovation on Glad is really working well and in fact in Q3 we're backing this up with an innovation that we feel very strong about and that is in partnership with P&G we're launching Glad with a gain sense, the gain sense is one that has played well as a scent endorsement across various categories and we feel like this is another opportunity for us to support our strategy of differentiating our trash bags and encouraging trade-up by delivering something that\u2019s unique and very hard for our competitors to replicate. So in a nutshell really strong merchandizing but in particular very strong consumer expectance in this premium trash segments behind our innovations and as a result you've also seen our market share in this premium trash segment up quite nicely.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Steve Towers with UBS.","Steve Towers","I guess just first on the commodity front, Steve, entertain me a little bit and think about a world where we are at sub $60 oil for the foreseeable future. I know it is early, but what does COGS deflation realistically look like in fiscal 2016? Is it negative 2%, 3%, 5%? And you mentioned potential offsets in terms of logistics costs going up and pricing promotional investments probably also going up in that world. But I just wonder if you could give us some guardrails as we think further out in terms of how you are thinking about the businesses preparing your fiscal 2016 budgeting given where oil is today?","Steve Robb","Yes, it's a good question and the short answer is it's hard to know. A couple of things I would point out obviously oil has moved down pretty significantly over the last 90 days it\u2019s not clear how long it will stay down at these levels. So I think as we start looking at our fiscal '16 planning we'll have to take a hard look at how long will these prices really stay at today's level I think certainly for the next six months or so we expect them to be depressed beyond that I think it remains to be same. A couple of other things I would point out about the resin market the supply demand balance still remains fairly tight here in the U.S. and so resin prices have yet to come down actually in the first half of our fiscal year resin pricing was up.","We do anticipate it'll go down in the second half, but that's mainly being driven by lower prices overseas and that's creating some downward pressure here in the U.S. so it's good but I would just temper expectations a bit to say it's not just energy prices it's also the supply demand balance. And then finally as you think of resin which is the largest commodity that we buy, keep in mind that historically in this category when you have seen a large move downward in resin pricing more than half of that has been spent back in the category and that's certainly what we're anticipating. So in short it\u2019s always better to have a tailwind than a headwind, but I think at this point we're cautiously optimistic on how that might play through in fiscal '16.","Steve Towers","Okay. I'll leave that there. But I guess, Benno, maybe from a top-line perspective, as you say, the scanner data has certainly been picking up and looked a bit better, which is a positive, but not nearly to the extent that we see in your reported numbers this quarter. So how much of the Q2 strength is really attributable just to timing of sell-in versus sell-out? Do you think channel inventories are okay because you do seem to be pointing towards a deceleration in the second half that goes beyond the professional and international dynamics that you mentioned?","Benno Dorer","Yes the first thing I'd say is keep in mind that the public share data doesn\u2019t capture the entire universe. We feel good about in the inventories that are out there there's nothing unusual in here. The two areas we're certainly watching is one is in Professional Products where we did see that Ebola concerns had some impact on that business that may lead to destocking in Q3 that'd be my expectation and then wipes certainly wipes have been up very strongly in that track channels. We don\u2019t think that Ebola had a big impact as the concerns faded away really quickly but the flu season certainly has been and is very strong, so we need to wait and see to understand whether that flows through to consumer consumption but other than that nothing particular inventories are where they need to be.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","So wanted to go back to, Steve, I think your comment about more than half of the commodity benefits are spent back and we have certainly seen that before, closer to 60%, maybe two-thirds is spent back. So I guess I am scratching my head still a little bit around the price increases that are theoretically justified on the bleach products and on wraps in particular. And I worry that you are asking for trouble in some sense because we see the spot market in resins, U.S. or abroad, it is coming down. It will likely come down and help you guys out, but also help your competitors. I'm just trying to figure out why you took that price increase and again if you're not just asking for a price gap expansion like you have gotten before in these categories and start getting hurt from a share all over again?","Steve Robb","So Ali let me take that question. A few thoughts, first of all the price increases are cost justified I mean I would just point out when you look at the total supply chain whether it's a labor inflation, healthcare cost, transportation cost in particular or even all the other raw material set those have all been moving up so we try to price as Benno said to the long-term average cost so I think we feel both the bleach increase as well Glad is a cost justified price increase. Now as it relates to Glad as you know the resin market it actually tends to go up pretty quick and comes down slow it has been the history, but there's been a longstanding issue where if prices start to come down in the spot market for resin sometimes you'll see a step up in merchandising activity. Well that's certainly what we're planning for and it\u2019s certainly baked into the outlook and our expectations but I think we've done a long track-record of managing the ups and downs of resin pricing with the Glad business quite successfully so we have seen this story before we managed during the long-term cost and I think we feel pretty good about the decisions we have taken and if conditions are different than we think we'll manage through it.","Ali Dibadj","I do want to go back a little bit to the lean in, I guess, on portfolio and try to get your sense of how comfortable you are with bags and wraps, professional and Burt's really leading the day. And on the one hand, it is great because it's diversification from your, \u201ca historical business or core business\u201d, but how do we think about that going forward and what are we going to hear about from your core and underlying businesses? And if you can tackle -- as you talk about portfolio -- the role of International because, of course, the main target we've been hearing about for a little while in terms of international is improving the margins there. And I get it; it is tough to tell with currencies. As best as we can tell, the margins are still going down or not getting that much better. So I am trying to understand how that fits in your portfolio? Does Clorox need to be an international company? Does it need to try to grow that business or should it just not? So both category portfolio, I guess and also international and geographic portfolio too, please.","Benno Dorer","Yes so on category first I mean as you know if I take step back we're very focused on driving the core business right. If you look at the three businesses that you referenced Ali that grew last quarter two of them really have been growing strongly for a long time and we've always pointed out those two businesses Professional and Burt's Bees as growth areas and like I said we're leaning into investments and those investments are showing good returns.","Glad I mean I probably wouldn't expect the growth rates that we've seen in the last quarter on Glad on a consistent basis going forward. But if I really look at underlying growth drivers that's innovation, the businesses where we had strong innovation they have grown. And as you know we're very focused on growing our business behind innovation and like I said we have a very strong innovation program out there also for the fiscal year back half. So we're growing, we're growing the right way and importantly if you look across the segments we're growing in all segments. So I feel good about how much we're focused on the core and which businesses are growing and I certainly would expect homecare also going forward to contribute more as Steve said we have just now a few days ago cycled through distribution loss with a major club customers, so that's the wipes growth that we're seeing in tracked channels hopefully will be visible also in shipments as we compare them versus year ago.","On International I think what we said in International is that what we do want to do is grow more profitably. We're expecting a 5% to 7% in sales growth but we want to turnaround our margins. International has a role in Clorox, we're executing the fundamentals well but I will also remind everybody that we're not trying to transform the Company into more of a global player, it's 20% of our portfolio and if I project on forward to 2020, I don't expect that number to be significantly higher. Certainly as you think about the challenges that we're seeing from an inflation point of view and FX I think what it will mean is that we will be more focused than ever on the activities on the margin enhancement side whether that's pricing, whether that is margin accretive innovation, applying the strong cost savings focus that we have in the U.S. and International or this goes back to the accelerator that I mentioned moving the portfolio towards more profitable categories that really I think will become more of a focus going forward.","How can we move our portfolio towards the categories that are more profitable and less perhaps volatile Burt's Bees is a good example and then certainly countries that are more economically stable and attractive like Peru and like Columbia, in and frankly also outside of Latin America. So International has a role but we will be very mindful to make sure that we grow but grow profitably.","Ali Dibadj","If I can sneak in just one quick one about the cost savings and it looks like at least in Q1, Q2 versus last year the pace of it slowed a little bit. Just allay our fears about that, if you would please, or not?","Benno Dorer","Ali I am happy to allay your fears. Cost savings in the gross margin you are probably looking at the Web attachments we had about 130 basis points of cost savings in gross margin keep in mind cost savings hits every line of the P&L, a good chunk of the cost savings this quarter came through our SG&A expenses. So in total for the quarter we had 27 million in cost savings and I would say we're certainly on-track to get 150 bps of EBIT margin expansion from the cost savings programs this year and continue to feel good about the pipeline going forward. So cost savings program is performing quite well for us.","Operator","And we will move next to Joe Altobello with Raymond James.","Joe Altobello","First, just want to drill a little bit deeper on the volume number this quarter. Back of the envelope looks like Professional added about a point to volume, is that correct?","Benno Dorer","The Professional Products business in terms of volume growth, no, the business was up double-digit in both volume and sales.","Joe Altobello","Right, but in terms of your overall volumes it added about a point in the quarter?","Benno Dorer","For the total company?","Joe Altobello","Yes, exactly.","Benno Dorer","That's right, sorry.","Joe Altobello","Okay. And then in terms of the second half, I understand why that would slow, but, Benno, you talked about you're lapping the lost distribution in wipes, so you have easy compares there. And I think you are also lapping some easier compares on bleach as well. So would those two items help to offset the slowdown in professional, or that's probably not the case?","Benno Dorer","I wouldn't overstate the slowdown in Professional. I mean the business was up double-digits in the second quarter obviously some of that maybe inventory that will get worked off in the third quarter but on balance we still think Professional Products would be in this 10% to 15% growth. I think as you look to the second half of the fiscal year here is how we're looking at it. The full year outlook for the Company is for sales growth of about 1%. Now on a currency adjusted basis it's probably in the range of 3% to 4%. Certainly in the first half of this fiscal we were at the higher end of that we came in at about 4% currency neutral sales growth. As we look to the second half I think we feel very good that we're on-track to have good positive volume growth, we're much on-track to have sales growth that's solid from an organic standpoint. I think the big wildcard that we're all watching pretty carefully is what happens with foreign currencies and again the outlook is 2% to 3% there but we could be at the mid or upper-end of that range kind of based on where the spot rates are today. But absent that I think the organic plans that we have are performing quite well for the Company.","Joe Altobello","And then in terms of Brita, you mentioned a new pitcher came out in November. The filters came out in August, but it seems like that business hasn't picked up yet. You mentioned earlier on the call, you said it will be stronger in the second half, but I think in the past you talked about growth or a return to growth in the second half of that business. Am I sort of splitting hairs there, or do you still expect growth?","Benno Dorer","Yes so, look I mean we expect that business to do better in the second half and we\u2019ve also said that on the share fronts we expect that to start growing again by perhaps middle of this year. The key will be for that innovation to take hold with consumer and the key will be to get better merchandizing plans with retailers and to be honest also support that innovation with the filter innovation with the right tools to get the price differential that we have compared to private labeled into the right place. So do expect a better half don\u2019t expect that business to grow strongly for the rest of the fiscal year but certainly better than in the first half of the fiscal.","Operator","And we will move next to Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research.","Wendy Nicholson","Just a tiny little point of clarification on Brita, how much of the business is the pitchers and the refill filters as opposed to the on-the-go portable business?","Benno Dorer","The large majority is in pitchers and filters Wendy, on-the-go is a nice and growing business but it\u2019s relative small.","Wendy Nicholson","Okay. Because the reason I asked, I sort of put it in the context of a bigger question about the Lifestyle segment and the margins there. We've seen margins up here in the first half of 2015, but over the last few years, the margins in that segment have come down a little bit and yet it is still a really profitable segment for you and I am just wondering, ballpark, competition in at least the on-the-go segment for Brita looks like it's going to get a little bit tougher now that Newell has made some acquisitions. It sounds like you are investing more on the advertising line for Bees. I don't know what is going on with margins in dressings and sauces, but I guess the question is how confident are you that that Lifestyle segment can sustain a margin 28% and above, if you will, a pre-tax margin?","Benno Dorer","I think let me go ahead and take that I think we feel pretty good about the margins of Lifestyle what\u2019s true is over the last couple of years we\u2019ve made some investments and we have made investments in Burt\u2019s Bees and systems and processes so for a period of time that depressed the margins for Burt\u2019s Bees and Lifestyle segment we kind of cycled through that. We\u2019re also investing more to drive growth in that segment particularly on the Burt\u2019s Bees business. So the margins are fundamentally healthy I think we believe we\u2019ve got good opportunities to expand them overtime. But because they are such healthy margins leaning into the growth side of that Bees business certainly seems to right us and that\u2019s what you are saying.","Wendy Nicholson","And so even when you're -- and I assume the gross margins on Bees are pretty good, so the incremental advertising is not materially going to move the needle on the EBIT margin or the pre-tax margin for Bees, is that fair to say?","Benno Dorer","It\u2019s going to vary quarter-by-quarter we just turned on national advertising recently which is actually performing early days but it looks like it\u2019s performing quite well for us Burt\u2019s Bees business was up strong double-digits in the second quarter so it has very health gross margins. So if we have an opportunity to invest a bit more in consumer demand building investment in advertising to drive the top-line that\u2019s a good investment and something we\u2019ll do. I think again over the long-term we feel like both gross margins and EBIT margins are just fine for all the businesses and segment and Burt\u2019s Bees.","Steve Robb","And Wendy as you know we\u2019re really focused on investing where we get the highest ROI and we got very solid analytics to understand where the ROI is best for the Company and investments in the said areas are based on what we know really show very solid ROI we\u2019re investing in the right areas.","Operator","And we will move next to Michael Steib with Credit Suisse.","Michael Steib","Steve, I wanted to follow up on your comments regarding free cash flow generation that improved significantly year-on-year in the first half and you have given us some of the reasons for that. I wonder how much of that is sustainable, is this a new level of cash generation for the Company, or were there some one-offs in there? Thanks.","Steve Robb","The free cash flow was it\u2019s obviously been very good for the first half of this fiscal year and as I indicated in my opening comments we continue to believe that free cash flow as a percentage of sales should be about 10%. And I think over the long-term we\u2019ve been pretty consistently in both good and bad years in this 10% to 12% free cash flow as a percentage of sales. So, one of the things that we continued to do quite well within the Company is convert sales to cash and be very disciplined in the allocation of that cash and I am personally feeling very good about what we\u2019re doing in that space and have every reason to believe it will continue into the future.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital Markets.","Connie Maneaty","As you take a look at the portfolio and invest in the ones that give you the highest return, are there some brands or products that you would look to exit or deemphasize because they do cost money to run? And I am thinking -- I don't even know if Good is still around, but things like Green Works. So what is your opinion on the parts of the portfolio that won't be getting most of the future investment?","Benno Dorer","Overall Connie we feel good about the portfolio and at the end of the day we\u2019re applying the same capabilities across the entire portfolio whether that\u2019s capabilities with the consumer or capabilities with customer or capabilities within the supply, and the synergies are pretty real, strong cash flow as Steve talked about, SG&A is comparatively low and ROIC is very strong. So I am very comfortable with the portfolio that we have, that isn\u2019t to say that we will always look with the Board on an annual basis at whether there is opportunities and whether we are still the highest value owner or not? And it\u2019s quite possible that we might be looking at some of the smaller businesses. But in general very comfortable with the portfolio and don\u2019t feel the need to do anything different. We want to grow bigger rather than smaller. And I think what we said is that we are interested in bolt on acquisitions to the tune of $25 million to $100 million in areas that are growth areas for us, and that are margin accretive on strategy, fit with our capabilities and that ideally are U.S. centric. So we are looking in whether that is health and wellness, or natural personal care or food enhancers and see if we can add, and that\u2019s really the mindset that we are in, while we will always be focused on growing the core business first. We think that there is places that we can play, that we are not playing in yet. And that\u2019s really our priority.","Operator","And we will move to our next question from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmitz","Can you just talk about the strategy accelerator process and what that means for the algorithm in terms of that 9%, 10% of sales in advertising and maybe the long-term growth rate? So do things change or is it zero-sum where you will move money out of places where it is less well spent and put into places where there might be better growth drivers? And then I have a follow-up, please?","Benno Dorer","Bill, as you think about the accelerators, they have really spotlights on our strategy 2020. So I think it\u2019s very consistent with what we said during the leadership transition that, we are not expecting the strategies to change, but what we are focused on is a doubling down on choices that is strategy 2020 are called for. So I expect that the financial algorithm that we are after with strategy 2020 will be the same. Advertising sales promotion which I think is what you referenced Bill the idea of investing another point in our brands that will remain the same. So these are really ways for us to fully accomplish our 2020 strategy financial objectives, as opposed to a departure from them.","Bill Schmitz","Okay. And then would you change any of the incentive compensation metrics around the strategy accelerators, so like the broader Company incentive compensation metrics?","Benno Dorer","We haven\u2019t decided yet, that\u2019s early. But I don\u2019t see why our compensation metrics would be wrong even in this context. Again these are just ways for us to emphasize aspects of the strategy that we have really started to put in place about 16 months ago. So they are not a radical departure. So I don\u2019t expect that but we will always revisit that overtime also with the Board.","Bill Schmitz","Okay, just to follow-up on the original question that Faucher asked, I think it was the first question, it seems like this promotional spending elevation in the front half of the calendar year is pretty consistent across the Companies that reported so far. It's a little bit coincidental, so I'm just wondering -- and obviously it is also impacting gross margin because of the higher gross to net -- is that really competitive-driven or are retailers starting to ask for some money back already because if you look at the Nielsen data, it doesn't seem like the percentage of ACV on deal, it's actually coming down, it is not going up?","Steve Robb","I think as Benno had indicated I don\u2019t think the competitive landscape is changed that much over the last couple of months. What I would say is it\u2019s higher than it\u2019s been historically so it\u2019s a very intense competitive environment here in the U.S. As companies have taken some of their focus off, somebody\u2019s emerging markets have focused back on the U.S. But I wouldn\u2019t say that broadly it\u2019s more competitive than we saw say three or six months ago. All of that said the one trend that we are watching very carefully is this resin price which again if it starts to move lower which is what we anticipate historically what we have seen is a good percentage of that has been spent back into the category. But absent that and I think the landscape remains as intensely competitive as we talked to you three and six months ago.","Bill Schmitz","Got you, so none of it\u2019s driven by retailers asking for more money back?","Steve Robb","No, we haven\u2019t seen that.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Erin Lash with Morningstar.","Erin Lash","Building off an earlier question, I was wondering if you could speak to just the priorities for cash given the significant amount of free cash flow that you have been generating?","Steve Robb","Yes the priorities are completely consistent with what we have been saying for many years now. We will support organic growth as Benno talked about keeping the core healthy. It\u2019s certainly working for us and it\u2019s something we are going to continue to do. We are interested obviously in M&A activity. If we can get businesses with 25 million to 100 million in sales that are margin accretive and have some tailwinds we are interested in that. As we\u2019ve talked in the previous call we feel very good about our debt-to-EBITDA, at the end of first quarter it was about 1.9 it\u2019s elevated as I indicated in the second quarter, but that\u2019s because we prefunded some debt but we certainly have dry powder I think which you should expect going forward is we will obviously keep the dividend healthy but if cash starts build up and we don\u2019t\u2019 have a use for it either for M&A or to support core growth probably in the form of share repurchases at some point will lean back into that to-date we\u2019ve been doing just some modest share buybacks earlier this fiscal year, but we haven\u2019t done much and we\u2019ve been more focused on refunding of the debt to-date.","Erin Lash","And then within the advertising spending line, I was wondering if you could just talk about the degree to which you have been using digital I guess as a -- compared to traditional advertising means and how effective or how you are measuring the returns on that and where you see that going?","Benno Dorer","Yes, digital right now is a little over 30% of our overall advertising sales promotion spend. That is as we understand the leading level in our industry and it\u2019s also up quite significantly over the last few years and again it\u2019s really based on a solid understanding of ROIs and the ROIs that we\u2019re getting in this space are really attractive. So we expect that shift to perhaps continue said that there is always going to be space for TV, TV continues to be a very effective driver of in particular awareness especially around innovations and like I said we feel good about our innovation program for the rest of fiscal year. But for us we call this what we need to be as always on we need to be where the consumer is no matter where she is in her purchase cycle and digital and social media is particularly suitable to help us accomplish that. So digital plays a very strong role and I expect that to keep going.","Operator","And we\u2019ll move to our next question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","Just two quick things, one was a follow-up on the promotional environment question. I still just am not sure why the commentary on an increase in trade promotion in the back half of the year versus prior expectations because I would've thought that -- you were saying if resin prices come down, you will be watching it, so I would think that is more of a fiscal \u201916 dynamic than something in the next six months, so anything you can add there would be great?","Steve Robb","Yes, to clarify I think as I indicated in my opening comments, the increase in trades for promotional spending is a full year number. I mean it\u2019s likely we will spend a bit more in the second half but it\u2019s mainly a full year comment. I think what\u2019s important is we\u2019re agnostic on whether it\u2019s trade or advertising, what we\u2019re looking for is the highest returns and what resonates the most with the consumers, so whether that\u2019s advertising, freight promotion or other things. We will be investing more we\u2019re trying to get to this one point at the incremental demand building investment as a percentage of sales overtime and so we\u2019re going to spend more I think is probably the key takeaway, but you will see it fall in different lines of the P&L at different times.","Benno Dorer","And Lauren, adding to Steve\u2019s point a significant portion of trade promotion also is going against innovations really to make sure that we drive strong merchandizing and trail out of the gate for those.","Lauren Lieberman","And then my second question was just actually on the professional products business. I think you have been clear on watching for any kind of destock in the third quarter, but I was just curious if you think that the recent phase of worries around Ebola and Enterovirus, has that perhaps pushed some of the cleaning standards and protocols and making changes higher on the priority list of some of the healthcare service industry than it was previously? Like could this be a sort of watershed event in terms of raising the profile of what you are trying to do?","Benno Dorer","I mean we certainly haven\u2019t see that Lauren and I think the cleaning protocols have been in place and what hospitals have been doing is just apply a cleaning protocols and make sure that they\u2019re prepared for a potential increase in use or around our products to coincide with these cleaning protocols, so do we expect heightened awareness and does it help us? I have a dialogue with hospitals going forward around these and what our products can deliver, we hope so, but we certainly haven\u2019t seen that in Q2 and we\u2019ll have to see how it plays out. But clearly we think that this is a growth category and that\u2019s why we\u2019re investing in it.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante","A question with regards to the U.S. again and I think that it was alluded earlier in the call, but I would like to, if it is possible, to get more clarification, has to do with the growth in the U.S. I know that the hospital part probably added a point, but still that means that growth in retail sales in non-tracked channels probably grew well over 10%. And I wonder whether you can tell us which particular brands, or what kind of retail format is growing -- you guys are finding new points of distribution to be posting that kind of growth and to what extent there were one-timers, promotional one-timers, other than the one that was described when it came to Ebola? Thank you.","Steve Robb","Javier let me lead off on this I would characterize the growth as broad-based I think we had some very good promotions that were in place that have been planned like cold and flu and leaning into those. But I wouldn\u2019t point to any single thing other than in the Professional space we had strong double-digit growth and some of that is probably hospitals building up inventory out of the concerns for Ebola. I think the U.S. growth was amazingly broad-based and we have talked Professional Products we have talked Glad we have talked Burt\u2019s Bees which was up and mostly the other businesses had a very solid quarter. So I think it was a clean set of numbers and there is not anyone thing I can point to. And even from a retailer standpoint it's again not any specific channel I think it was just across the board it was solid healthy growth for the Company.","Benno Dorer","Yes for me Javier I would really say that the two things I would point to that led to this broad-based growth as Steve said are one innovation and two the increase in demand spend and even on businesses that perhaps benefited from flu that\u2019s based on long-term planning with retailers and we saw just very strong merchandized execution behind long planned events that certainly benefited from somewhat [Audio Gap] but it's really been about innovation and increase in demand spend and there is nothing funky about this growth at all.","Operator","And we will take a follow-up question from Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital Markets.","Connie Maneaty","The cost pressures that led to the price increase in bleach seem to be pretty generic and not really limited to bleach, so Healthcare costs, wage inflation, logistics, all of that. So should we expect price increases then in a broader part of your portfolio going forward?","Steve Robb","Connie I think what we said the inflationary pressures are obviously pretty real and the increases that we previously mentioned are the kind that tend not to reverse themselves. I think most of the pricing we've taken to-date has really been focused on the International markets where we're dealing with much higher rates of inflation. You'll continue to see us lean into that. On the U.S. side again where it\u2019s cost justified and pricing to a long-term average cost we will continue to take pricing as Benno noted we've got a very long track-record of doing this and balancing it with value. I will say forward looking that one thing that has worked for us that we want to continue is trying to marry up pricing with innovation because I think if you can bring those two things together it translates into good value for the consumer here itself and it tends to do much better. So short answer is we're not afraid to take pricing in the U.S. when it\u2019s cost justified we would like to avoid it when we can and certainly marry it up with innovation. But we feel like the recent price increases we have taken are the right ones for the long-term.","Benno Dorer","And to build on Steve's point and I think you mentioned it Steve so we will remain focused on value, value of course is a function of pricing but also investing in our brands and also having innovation out there and delivering superior products all that won't change.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session Mr. Dorer I would now like to turn the program back to you.","Benno Dorer","Yes thanks everyone. To sum up, I feel very good about the second quarter and what was really a solid first half performance. And I have confidence in our plans for the balance of the year. And I certainly look forward to speaking with you again on our next call in May.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation."],"5290":["The Clorox (NYSE:CLX) Q3 2013 Earnings Call May  1, 2013  1:30 PM ET","Executives","Steve Austenfeld - Former Vice President of Investor Relations","Stephen M.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Mr. Steve Austenfeld, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Mr. Austenfeld, you may begin your conference.","Steve Austenfeld","Thank you. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining Clorox's Third Quarter Conference Call. On the call with me today are Don Knauss, Clorox's Chairman and CEO; and Steve Robb, our Chief Financial Officer. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet, and a replay of the call will be available for 7 days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com.","Let me remind you that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures including, but not limited to: free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt-to-EBITDA and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations.","Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today\u2019s press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the Financial Results area of our website, as well as in our filings with the SEC. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today\u2019s earnings release.","Please recognize that today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.","So with that said, I'm going to cover the highlights of our third quarter business performance by segment and then turn it over to Steve to address our Q3 results, updated outlook for fiscal '13 and our preliminary outlook for fiscal year '14, which begins in July. Don will then close with his perspective on the business, followed by a question-and-answer session.","In Q3, volume was flat and sales grew 1% versus the year-ago period, both below expectations we had at the time of our last earnings call. When we announced our second quarter earnings in early February, sales growth through the first half of the year was 5%, and that was followed by January shipments that were up nearly 10%. So the trends at that time were very positive. However, unusually cold weather conditions in most U.S. regions significantly impacted our Charcoal business in the quarter. In particular, the month of March, which is usually the kickoff for the grilling season, experienced the coldest weather in the U.S. in over 10 years. The end result was that our Charcoal business reduced our company's third quarter sales by 1.5 percentage points.","Turning to our categories. Total company results in the U.S. were about flat. The Bleach category was up strongly in the quarter following our recent transition to concentrated bleach. The Cat Litter and Natural Personal Care categories were also up nicely, offset by declines in Glad, Food, Water Filtration and Charcoal.","Our multi-outlet market share was also about flat for the quarter. While we saw share gains in about half of our businesses, with particular strength in Home Care, Glad and Food, we lost market share in Charcoal and Brita, primarily due to past pricing actions which competitors have yet to fully follow.  On the Laundry side, bleach shares were down, which I'll address in a moment.","Let me turn to our segment results. Our Cleaning segment grew volume by 1% and sales by 2%. Our Home Care business saw another quarter of record shipments across multiple brands, including Clorox disinfecting products, our increased merchandising events for the flu season as well as spring cleaning.","Our Professional Products business delivered solid results, with another quarter of double-digit base business growth due to very strong gains in the cleaning and health care channels.","In Laundry, we successfully completed the rollout of concentrated bleach in the United States. Execution on the transition has been outstanding, and we are confident we will realize the cost savings anticipated for the project. Positively, concentrated bleach is also driving category growth, which is up more than 6% on a 52-week basis. Bleach volume was flat, however, due to market share declines, which have been impacted by strong merchandising and distribution of private label brands in a few customers.","That said, our most recent market share data, looking at a 4-week basis, reflects that 15 of our top 20 customers are showing improved results versus the 13-week or quarterly data. So the trend is clearly moving in the right direction.","Clorox 2 volume and sales also declined due to continued weak category trends. Overall for Laundry, improving share results is a major focus for us and we're increasing our investments to drive brand and category growth over the long term, including advertising and product innovation on Clorox 2.","In our Household segment, volume was down 4% and sales declined 1%, both due solely to double-digit declines in our Charcoal business. Following continued soft consumption through April, we now expect Charcoal sales to resume their normal pace beginning in May.","Turning to Glad, our trash bag business had another nice quarter with sales and market share up on premium trash bags, and Cat Litter also saw sales growth in the quarter behind healthy category growth.","Our Lifestyle segment delivered volume growth of 1% and sales growth of 2%. Burt's Bees had another great quarter behind innovation and lip color products.","Our Food business also delivered another quarter of strong growth behind higher shipments of Hidden Valley dressings and new sandwich spreads, which were launched earlier in the year. Brita volume and sales were down compared to a strong volume period a year ago when we launched the Brita Bottle as well as due to increased competitive activity and the impact of pricing the competitors have yet to fully follow.","Our focus on Brita is to drive category growth through innovation, and we have a number of new products launching later this summer.","In our International segment, volume grew 1% with sales up 2%, reflecting the benefit of pricing but offset by foreign currency headwinds. We are delivering double-digit growth in many of our International markets, including Chile, Peru and our International Burt's Bees business. These strong results are being driven by healthy category growth, price increases and investments we're making in our brands at the local level. This is important to recognize as this really strong performance is being masked by the continued economic challenges and currency headwinds in Argentina and Venezuela, which together represent about 1\/3 of our International business.","Our near-term strategy is to take actions locally to minimize the impact of high inflation and price controls in those 2 markets while continuing to drive innovation and invest in the rest of our International business where growth, as I mentioned, remains quite strong.","Looking at the full fiscal year, we've narrowed our sales outlook to 3% to 4% and expect to come in at the lower end of that range due to the weather impact on Charcoal. Our sales outlook continues to reflect a challenging comparison to very strong second half results a year ago as well as the impact of declining foreign currencies and continued uncertainty in Argentina and Venezuela. Although we certainly would have liked to deliver strong results this quarter, we feel good about our plans for the year, including increasing our advertising investment to grow our market shares and our categories.","With that, I'll turn it over to Steve Robb.","Stephen M. Robb","Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. We anticipated the second half of fiscal '13 is going to be more challenging as we face difficult comparisons versus a year ago and foreign currency declines. But as Steve mentioned, we had unusually cold weather in late March, which reduced our Charcoal sales by 14% versus the year-ago quarter and volume by more than 20% in the month of March alone. This impacted total company sales by 1.5 percentage points, gross margin by 30 basis points and earnings per share by $0.06. While we continue to feel good about the long-term prospects for our Charcoal business, the impact from poor weather will affect the category and our total company results for the fiscal year.","Now I'll provide more depth on our third quarter results, our financial outlook for fiscal '13, as well as our preliminary outlook for fiscal '14.","We delivered 1% sales growth on the quarter on top of a strong 7% sales growth in the year-ago period. Our sales results were driven largely by the benefit of price increases, offsetting the impact of 1.5 points from lower Charcoal volume and nearly 1 percentage point of unfavorable foreign currencies, particularly in Argentina and Venezuela. As you know, Venezuela devalued its official currency by more than 30% on February 8. And Argentina, our largest business outside of North America, has seen its currency decline significantly for the last several years. Excluding these factors, our results for the quarter were solid, with sales increasing 3% and we continue to feel good about our fiscal year-to-date sales growth of 3.8%.","In the third quarter, gross margin declined about 20 basis points from 42.3% of sales in the year-ago quarter to 42.1%. Higher manufacturing and logistics costs impacted gross margins about 250 basis points. This was largely due to challenges in our International and Charcoal businesses, including inflationary pressures and price controls in Argentina and Venezuela and higher logistic costs associated with lower Charcoal shipments. These factors were offset by 150 basis points of cost savings and more than 100 basis points from pricing. As expected, the commodity costs were about flat year-over-year, and we continue to anticipate an overall flat commodity environment for the fiscal year.","For the full year, we continue to anticipate declining benefit of cost savings of 150 basis points, and pricing will enable us to deliver both gross margin and EBIT margin expansion.","Third quarter selling and administrative expense decreased as we lapped significant IT-related investments in the year-ago quarter and had lower employee incentive compensation accruals in the current quarter. We now anticipate selling and administrative cost to be about 14.5% of sales in fiscal '13, reflecting productivity gains and reduced costs associated with prior infrastructure-related investments.","Advertising spending in the third quarter was in line with our expectations, increasing to 9.3% of sales. Importantly, our U.S. retail spending came in at 10.3% of sales, reflecting continued strong investment in our domestic brands and categories. Spending was significantly lower in International markets, consistent with our approach to invest prudently in countries with challenging market conditions. For the full fiscal year, we expect total company advertising will be about 9% of sales, reflecting a healthy increase in the fourth quarter.","Our effective tax rate of 33.9% on earnings from continuing operations for the third quarter was in line with expectations but up almost 2 points versus the year-ago quarter. For the full fiscal year, we continue to anticipate our tax rate will be between 33% and 34%.","Year-to-date free cash flow increased to $352 million versus $214 million in the same period a year ago. This increase was a result of favorable changes in working capital, the prior year settlement of interest rate forward contracts and higher earnings. We continue to anticipate free cash flow as a percentage of net sales to be about 10% with capital spending of about $180 million. As a reminder, we define free cash flow as cash provided by continuing operations less capital expenditures.","We ended the quarter with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.2:1, well within our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x.","Net of all of the factors we discussed today, we delivered diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $1 in the third quarter, a decrease of 2% versus the year-ago quarter. This reflects a negative impact of $0.06 from lower Charcoal sales and $0.05 from unfavorable foreign exchange rates, particularly in Argentina and Venezuela.","Turning to our fiscal year outlook. Sales growth is now anticipated to be in the range of 3% to 4%. As Steve mentioned, it will likely come in at the lower end of that range as we expect lower Charcoal sales in Q4 and the continued impact of declining foreign currencies and challenging market conditions in Argentina and Venezuela. For the full fiscal year, we continue to anticipate EBIT margin expansion from 25 to 50 basis points, consistent with our long-term annual target.","Our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations continues to be in the range of $4.25 to $4.35. This continues to include a range of $0.05 to $0.10 of diluted earnings per share impact for economic uncertainty in Venezuela.","The recent devaluation was a $0.02 impact, and with the remainders expected to cover the effects -- impacts of inflation, price controls and consumer uncertainty over the course of the fiscal year.","Now I'll turn to our financial outlook for 2014.  We anticipate sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%, reflecting continued product innovation moderated by about 1 point of negative impact from declining foreign currency, with nearly all of that coming from Argentina.","For the full fiscal year, we anticipate gross margins to be about flat, reflecting cost savings of 150 basis points and some benefit from pricing, offset by about 1 point in commodity cost increases, mostly from resin, and another point from inflation, impacting manufacturing and logistics costs.","We expect EBIT margin to increase 25 to 50 basis points, reflecting lower selling and administrative expenses, consistent with our long-term goal of reducing this line item to 14% or less of sales. We also anticipate a higher effective tax rate of 34% to 35% in the next fiscal year.  Net of all of these factors, we anticipate diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.55 to $4.70 for fiscal '14.","The company's outlook also reflects a $0.05 to $0.10 of diluted earnings per share impact related to anticipated effects of continued price controls and high inflation in both Argentina and Venezuela as well as the impact from the previous devaluation of the bol\u00edvar.","Now given the continued uncertainty in the Venezuela foreign exchange system following recent elections, we are not assuming any additional currency devaluation in our fiscal '14 outlook at this time. However, for perspective, if the bol\u00edvar devalued by 30% or from VEF 6.3 to VEF 9.0 to the U.S. dollar, the approximate full year impact to the company could be at least 0.5 of sales growth and the potential impact from the balance sheet remeasurement could be about $0.05 of diluted earnings per share.","In closing, I believe we're taking the right steps to manage through the macroeconomic headwinds we're facing, particularly in our Venezuela and Argentina businesses.","We're also taking the right steps to drive margin improvement over time, including reducing selling and administrative expenses and building on our strong track record for delivering consistent cost savings annually.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Don.","Donald R. Knauss","Okay. Thanks, Steve, and hello, everyone on the call. Before I open it up to questions, just let me give you my point of view on the year-to-date results and what we're seeing with the consumer out there and also the outlook we provided today.","So I'd say about the full year, we feel good about the year-to-date performance, even with the impact of the headwinds that both Steves talked to you about -- that we faced in this quarter. I think 3\/4 of the way through this year, we've delivered about 4% sales growth, about 60 points -- basis points of gross margin expansion and about 6% diluted EPS growth. So we feel good about that performance.","And although we've tightened our FY '13 sales outlook to the lower end of the range as we head into Q4, we're pleased that we're still targeting solid top line growth for the year, even with the negative impacts from foreign currency and the -- obviously, the weather-driven declines in our Charcoal business. When we saw a 23% decline in the category in the month of March -- we've never quite seen a category decline like that in a major category of ours. So importantly, we continue to anticipate in achieving our target range for EBIT margin growth as well as the EPS growth that we've talked to you about.","I also believe we're being prudent in our assumptions regarding some of the headwinds out there. Our outlook takes into account the operating and consumer environment, the economic challenges we anticipate continuing in Venezuela and Argentina, which Steve just went through, and the softness in our Charcoal business, which has continued into April. Today's outlook reflects our view that the economic recovery continues to be bumpy despite an uptick in optimism in February. When we looked at the U.S. consumer confidence levels, they dipped more than 8 points in March as, I think, the reality of the 2% increase in payroll taxes took hold, and many of the consumers are -- obviously had faced some delays in receiving their income tax returns and also the job market improvement did tend to level off.","I'm pleased that we're holding market share in the U.S. at about flat while our categories continue to improve. If you look at those categories, they've grown about 1.1% with the 52 weeks ending on March 24. So getting back more into historical ranges on the 1 to 2 points of category growth.","And apart of the difficulties in Argentina and Venezuela, our International business otherwise remains pretty healthy. So we're seeing strong growth in many markets, for example, in most other market in Latin America. For example, we grew 4% in sales in Latin America in Q3. And our Burt's business outside -- Burt's Bees business outside the United States continues to grow in strong double digits.","Now of course, having said that, it's not to diminish the real impact of Argentina and Venezuela on our overall business, and we certainly can't change the weather or the actions of foreign governments. I think we're taking the appropriate actions to manage the business effectively in that environment.","So looking ahead to '14, the outlook we've provided today, I'm pleased that we're targeting solid sales and earnings growth, and I think we've factored in prudently the headwinds that we see. So as we look forward to next year, you can count on us to focus on 3 primary areas: First, delivering on our goal of 3 points of growth from innovation and continuing strong support for our brands.  In fact, being at the upper end of our 9% to 10% range on spending in the U.S. market. Second, delivering improvements in productivity and administrative costs. And then thirdly, smartly managing through and being transparent with all of you on the challenges in Argentina and Venezuela. So I'm optimistic about those plans going forward and confident in our ability to execute those plans and as we continue to focus on driving long-term shareholder value. So with that, why don't we go ahead and open it up for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Ferrara with Bank of America.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to try to tease through some of the stuff that -- like some of the moving parts for the quarter that may or may not be recurring, right? And I guess, can we start out with the -- like the $50 million to $55 million for IT infrastructure, what was that number? I guess that's still the full year number for '13. And what was it in Q3, if you have it? What was the breakout of COGS and SG&A?","Stephen M. Robb","This is Steve. What I would say is our outlook continues to anticipate about $50 million to $55 million for that. It breaks out pretty evenly across the quarters with a little bit more in the back half. But generally, it's pretty even is what I would say. And as you look to fiscal '14, as we've talked before, we do anticipate the typical numbers, we'll call it $20 million to $30 million that we typically set aside, will return to more of a normalized rate.","Steve Austenfeld","And Chris, majority of that was in selling and admin expense. There's a little bit that runs through R&D, a small amount to go through Other Income. But for the most part, that's in selling and admin, which is, again, enabler to our selling and admin expense reductions next year.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And then on Venezuela, what was the -- can you talk about what the hit was for -- like, break out the balance sheet remeasurement versus ongoing, if that's possible, what it was in the quarter. And I think you said it was $0.02 for the quarter, but I'm not sure if that was the remeasurement or ongoing. And like how do I think about that? And is $0.05 to $0.10 -- I think you said that's still number of the drag baked into the '13 number. Does that make sense?","Stephen M. Robb","Yes, it does. So let me try to help you understand it. So a couple of things.  The balance sheet remeasurement piece in the third quarter was approximately $0.02. Now that's probably less than what people might expect because there was actually a 30% devaluation in the bol\u00edvar. But I would just remind everyone that we were using the  SITME to translate our financial statements. That had a rate of approximately 5.7. So when it went from -- to 6.3, we also experienced about a 10% devaluation. So that's why it was only a $0.02 devaluation, a little bit less than we were anticipating. Now what I would say is that the $0.05 to $0.10 that we set aside in our outlook is still the right number because while the balance sheet remeasurement came in a bit less, unfortunately, inflation continues to ramp up in that country and we're continuing to experience stringent price controls, which is really compressing our margins. So we've got the $0.05 to $0.10 for fiscal '13. It's the right number based on what we have seen fiscal year-to-date, and certainly what we expect. And we've also set aside a similar amount for fiscal '14 of $0.05 to $0.10. But that $0.05 to $0.10, again, is to cover price controls, inflation, really, the impact that's coming through on the margins as well as just economic uncertainty. What we have not built in is an additional devaluation of the bol\u00edvar beyond what we've already seen.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And I'm sorry, just one last one. The -- I know, obviously, the weather hurt you. But cold and flu probably helped you right through up double digits. Do you have a quantification for what that benefit might have been?","Donald R. Knauss","Why, I think, Chris, that we saw some help in January from the -- from the flu issue we had in November, December, really dissipated fairly quickly after mid, late January. And I think that was one of the drivers behind the 10% volume growth that Steve talked about. In January, we saw that, but it quickly dissipated. And then we got into this unusually cold weather from mid-February on through March.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Wendy Nicholson with Citigroup.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","My question goes sort of to the heart of the Charcoal issue, which is not to be overly critical, but I am wondering if it was maybe more of a year-over-year comp issue as opposed to a weather issue. Because I went back and looked at your transcript from third quarter of last year, and you talked about high single-digit volume growth in Charcoal, which just doesn't show up in the Nielsen data for category growth. And I know we don't see all of the channels in the Nielsen data, but I still wonder if maybe we just all had our expectations not set right, given the tough comp. But sort of - I guess, more broadly speaking about Charcoal, the category growth there has been so sluggish on an annual basis for so long. And even with all your spending, your market shares have been under pressure. So I know when you sold the Auto Care business it was a really tough decision, but it was kind of the right thing to do. Do you think that the Charcoal business still has a place in the portfolio given how slow growth that is? Are the margins that good that it makes sense to keep it? So if you could talk about it a little bit more, just not -- I don't really care about the quarter so much, but just longer term about the business, that would be great.","Donald R. Knauss","Yes. Wendy, it's Don. I think it still plays a key role in our portfolio. I think it's, obviously, the highest share brand we have at almost 75 share. I think you'll start to see share building back again. We already saw in April where we're picking up some share again. I think the sluggishness in the category has been more related to the pricing we've taken, and there's no pricing planned for this upcoming year. So I think we'll start to see these consumption trends turn around a bit. I also think that there was some dislocation in some of the key customers that are not measured by the Nielsen data as well. When you look at the home improvement centers, I think a lot of people had significant investments in the category last year, drove some very high consumption. Plus, we obviously had the warmest March in about 115 years last year, which kicked off the season. So there was some unusual stuff going on that I think is transitory and will even out over time. But I do think the brand at a 75 share with very healthy margins and with the fact that I think we've got a number of retailers now that, for the medium to long term, really see this as a key brand in meal solutions. And I think we are making progress on making this more than a 4-month business. So I think given all those measures, the fact that we're seeing significant tie-ins between Hidden Valley and KC Masterpiece and Charcoal, it gives us a lot of credibility with retailers to be part of the solution around meals. So I think it does play a strategic role in the portfolio, and I think you'll start to see that consumption trend change.","Stephen M. Robb","The one other thing I would add, and I know you've heard this before, but internally, as we look at this category, I mean, it is really unique in that it's -- again, just us and private label competing.  We have 100% share of voice and we've got fantastic relationships with the retailers on this to where it's a category that just has great dynamics, and they're very hard to find. So I think with that, we've got a lot of positives this early cycle [ph].","Donald R. Knauss","It's hard to quantify all the tailwinds we get off it, Wendy, on other brands that we link it to. So it really does play an important strategic role.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And is it both -- it's accretive on both the gross margin and on the EBIT margin line, is that right?","Stephen M. Robb","It's got gross margins that are fairly consistent with the company average. And I would say that the EBIT margins look particularly good, and it's a business that throws off a lot of cash. So from an economic standpoint, it's actually a very attractive category and we've gotten good shares.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","We've heard some companies talk about the fact that volumes don't seem to be responding to what may be a heightened promotional environment or at least less pricing growth in the categories, as raw material inflation has lessened. Can you talk about sort of what you're seeing and whether that's gotten better over the course of -- the first couple of months of the year? Are you seeing consumers respond to promotions? Or is it just sort of a tree falling in the woods at this point?","Donald R. Knauss","John, I think if you exclude the Charcoal issue we had, volumes were actually up 1% in the quarter. And with categories flattish, that doesn't sound too bad to us. So there's a little bit of vibrancy there on volume. We had 2% volume growth last year. So it's not like we're seeing this 2%, 3%, 4% bleed off in volume. We've got some stability there in volume. So we're seeing actually trade spending come down modestly, and I think that's one of the reasons, if you look at the last 5 -- if you look at the last 6 quarters in the Nielsen data now that measures 81% of our volume. 5 of those quarters were growing in the 1.5% to 2% range in dollars. And then, obviously, this last quarter ending March 24, it was flattish to down 0.2 point. There was certainly pricing in those quarters. I don't think you're going to see much pricing over the next 6 to 12 months. And I think that may bode better for a little bit more stability and maybe a little bit more growth in volume.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So you don't see anything that would make you think that the volumes aren't going to at least rebound somewhat at this point?","Donald R. Knauss","I think we'll see volumes very stable. Like I said, if you exclude Charcoal from this quarter, we were up 1%. If you look at the last year, we were up 2%. I think as -- I don't think you're going to see much pricing in the CPG sector in the next 6 to 12 months, as I said, because we take pricing based on 2 principles.  One is we've got commodity cost we have to recover or we got significant innovation that warrants a price dislocation. Well, we've got some good innovation. If any -- if you see any pricing from us, it will be hooked to innovation, just like we did on the spray bottles that we just launched a couple of months ago. But when you look at the base brands and our plans for next year, there's virtually no pricing in there in the United States because there's not enough commodity pressure to justify it.  So I think with that lack of pricing and with the heavy investment of 10%-plus on advertising and promotion in the U.S. that we're going to do, I think we'll see a little bit of vibrancy, certainly some stability in volume.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can you just talk about what your percentage of growth is in new products year-to-date and maybe some of -- like maybe what some of the products are?","Stephen M. Robb","Bill, this is Steve Robb. Let me lead off on this one. I don't want to break it down but I would say they were very much on track to get to the 3% incremental sales growth from our new products, and it's been pretty consistent. We've got the bleach, as you know, we've been rolling out regionally and we've really completed that rollout in the third quarter. And we've got our SMART TUBE technology that we're pretty excited by. It's kind of the first real innovation in spray cleaners in a long time, and that came out in the third quarter. So I would say by the end of the year, we should have an incremental 3 points of sales growth.","Donald R. Knauss","Yes. Bill, if you tick down through the categories, I think and you look at -- this is a year-to-date number, not a quarter because I think you can get messed up looking at just a 13-week period. But if you look at Home Care, for example, very strong growth in Home Care, almost 6% year-to-date and a lot of that obviously coming from Wipes, some tailwind behind, obviously, the flu issue that we had in the fall. When you look at Laundry, Steve talked about the compaction thing. We've seen some growth there over the course of the year. So we're positive on Laundry for the full year, obviously, not in the quarter. If you look at Glad, we've seen strong growth from Glad, with some of the innovation around ForceFlex and OdorShield. If you look at Food, Food's up in the mid -- low mid-single digits. Again, sandwich spreads, some of the other flanker line items off of -- that we've launched off of Hidden Valley have been well received. And Burt's, I mean, Burt's had another double-digit quarter. And I think, if you look at the innovation around lip shimmers, lip wands, I think the team is doing an exceptional job there. So if you look at this 4% growth year-to-date, as Steve said, we're well on track to getting 3 points from new products, and the rest of it is a little bit of pricing.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And then it seems like for at least 2 to 3 segments, you cited higher logistics and manufacturing costs, some of which are nonrecurring. And what are those and kind of what's driving the inflation there?","Stephen M. Robb","Yes. So if you look at the quarter, we had about 250 basis points of gross margin compression associated with higher manufacturing logistics. A good percentage of that is just inflationary pressures on wages and benefits, and a lot of that is coming out of our International markets where, as you know, we're just really struggling to get pricing through given the government restrictions. But some of this is onetime costs for investments we're making, like the SMART TUBE technology, the concentrated bleach and those things. And we would expect some of that to anniversary off as we cycle through the numbers. And then there was also a little bit -- it's not large, but there was some in our Charcoal business. Unfortunately, in Charcoal, basically, you produce a lot to get ready for the early season. The production was going full steam, but when the shipments were down 23% in March, we incurred more warehousing costs, more logistics costs and those kinds of things. I would expect next year we'll be able to anniversary some of that. But that did cost us about 0.3333 point in margin.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I just want to go back to -- your consumer, and I think Don, you touched on a little bit of this earlier, but what did you guys see in the quarter in terms of the continuing shift toward larger sizes, so much shopping trips and more deal-conscious consumer overall?","Donald R. Knauss","Yes. I think it's interesting. We monitor, obviously, social media. The primary issue that was most chattered about -- well, there were 3. The primary one was weather, cold weather. We saw the most chatter in social media about that, whether it was tweets or Facebook. The second one was around managing budgets and around payroll tax increase and delayed tax returns and higher gas prices and people having to really stick to a budget. The third issue, and this dissipated quickly after early mid-January, was the flu. So I think, Joe, we've got a continued consumer who's very pressured week to week. I mean, that hasn't really changed. And I think what has changed is we have these 5 quarters in a row of about 1.5% to 2% category growth, and then bam, we hit this point -- negative 0.2 in the latest quarter. And I think a lot of that, obviously -- there's all of those factors influencing that, higher payroll taxes, gas prices, et cetera. The weather was also a big piece of that. So I don't know that a lot's changed. I wouldn't -- I certainly wouldn't read too much into one quarter of category slowdown here. I think that we've had 15 months of pretty good growth. But I do think, to John's earlier question, that","once this -- once we see more mitigated pricing in the next 6 to 12 months, maybe we'll see a little bit less category growth in dollars and a little more stabilization in category around volume.","Stephen M. Robb","And just building on Don's comment, the one thing I would point out is unfortunately, if you follow the news, the weather is particularly bad in April as well. So not only did it impact us in March but it is continuing to impact us, primarily on the Charcoal business in April. We're hoping May and June will be better as we get into the primary consumption period, but it is something, as Don says, we're hearing a lot about it from consumers, and we're watching this very carefully.","Donald R. Knauss","We saw this pattern 2 years ago where we had an April -- a bad April on Charcoal and made up most of the difference in May and June. I mean, May and June are the pivotal months. That's when about 1\/3 of this Charcoal business is done, so that, obviously, behind Mother's Day and Memorial Day kicking into the season.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And just switching gears to commodities. You mentioned that you expect next year commodities to be about 100 basis point drag on the gross margin. This year it's been relatively benign. You did talk about resin. Could you talk about that in a little more detail and maybe how many of your commodities -- how much of your commodities have you locked in at this point?","Stephen M. Robb","Yes. So let me start with resin. In fiscal '13, current fiscal year, we've actually seen resin prices decline on a year-over-year basis, and that's actually been good news for us because the lower resin prices have enabled us to offset higher commodity prices in other commodity groups so that net-net, it's been a fairly benign environment. As we look forward to fiscal '14, we're anticipating energy will trade in the range of $90 to $100 for oil. We do anticipate that resin will begin coming back up again. And so what you'll see is modest inflation in packaging materials and chemicals, plus slightly higher resin pricing. And when you bring it together, we think it's about a 1 point drag overall to the commodity environment. The only thing we know here is that, as you're well aware, commodities are very -- they can move a lot. They're volatile. So you could see some variability across the quarters associated with this, and we'll just have to get into the year and monitor it.","Steve Austenfeld","And Joe, as it relates to how much of the costs are locked in, I think we mentioned in the past that where we have options to hedge some things like soybean oil, corn and others, we generally did try to get some predictability in that through hedging. But the reality is it's a relatively small percentage of our commodity buy. So most of our commodity buy, although there may be delays as to when it filters to the P&L, were going to be subject to market movement.","Operator","Will take your next question from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein Research.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I know we talked a lot about kind of Charcoal impacting the top line volume. But I did want to go a little bit deeper on the Cleaning segment. You mentioned -- we all kind of saw the flu season being quite strong, concentrated bleach should have helped. And look, I understand Clorox 2 hurt. But how big of an impact could that have been because we've been hearing about Clorox 2 hurting for years now. So I'm just trying to get underneath and see are there other big things that you think drove -- you touched on private label merchandising, and again to try to tease out what -- kind of a consistent thing we need to worry about? Or is this just a short term blip?  Because some us believe the volume number was a little bit disappointing in that as well.","Donald R. Knauss","Yes. I think, Ali, let me start and Steve can jump in. On Clorox liquid bleach, I think we saw this pattern 12 years ago when we went through the first round of compaction. And we saw -- it took a while for consumers to adjust. I think we're seeing some decent category growth. But primarily, the issue we have is in a handful of customers. Like Steve pointed out in his talking points before we got into the Q&A, we've seen 15 of the top 20 customers share position improve in the last 4-week period. We've seen at least over half -- if you look at the 13-week period, we've seen at least over 1\/2 or more of the top 20 customers gaining share, our CLB gaining share. So I think we're seeing some sequential improvement. We have an issue in a couple of key customers, and it really results from this. And it's -- on the one hand, it's a double-edged sword. It's helping drive the category significantly but it's not helping us specifically right now. Let me explain. When the pricing was held -- we took pricing about 1.5 years ago, and Walmart held that pricing. I think Walmart, obviously, using national brands to drive traffic as they've gotten back on track with their more historical growth records -- or growth rates. As they held that pricing, it certainly put downward pressure somewhat on the industry in general. But what it also did was it depressed the penny profit that some retailers are obviously making on Clorox liquid bleach relative to private label. So that's one of the issues that we've been addressing most recently. And I think that's why we're seeing 15 of the top 20 now pick up some share as we try to get back to -- either through special packs or different merchandising events, different higher value SKUs that private label can't replicate, whether it's Splash-less or different scents, outdoor, different ways of -- gel bleach, so different ways of changing the mix up so that when you look at the profit picture on Clorox liquid bleach, it looks favorable. So that's the issue we're addressing. As I said, I think we're getting the majority of the top 20 now moving in the right direction but that's been the central issue is it's really -- it's not so much that the consumer poll of Clorox liquid bleach or private label bleach, it's the shifting of merchandising support inside some of these key retailers to more private label because of the penny profit issue.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And are you losing shelf space because of the concentration now? Or do you anticipate to do so before -- because that was one of my [indiscernible] as being...","Donald R. Knauss","Yes. If you look -- as you look at the top 20 customers, we have -- the category has not lost shelf space in any. In terms of our shelf space, I'd say maybe 1 or 2 of those 20 we've lost shelf space. In the others, we've either held or gained.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, cool. So slightly different topic.  If you could talk a little bit more about what you think the right level to ad spend is. Even 9% is actually quite low versus -- if you have a kind of historical -- I totally get there's kind of this natural downdraft from categories, Away From Home, as an example, or International mix. Do you think that this is the right level? And to pile on to a flavor of an earlier question, we've been hearing from a lot of CPG companies that it's getting tougher to grow, more expensive to grow. Are you sensing that?","Donald R. Knauss","Yes. Well, as far as the right level, Ali, I would say it this way: we spent 10.3% on U.S. Retail in the quarter. I think you'll see that level between 10%, 11% continue into FY '14. And again, I know you've heard this before but just to reiterate, we've got brands like Hidden Valley that are spending significantly above that level. We've got brands that, because of their unique share position like Charcoal with a 75 share that's been well under 10%, the dynamics of the category don't merit that kind of spend. So in those categories where we see competitive intensity, we're spending well north of 10%. And I think we've got a kind of a unique mix given the eclectic nature of our portfolio, where we don't have to spend at the same level. You can get kind of lost in the averages. So I think 10% to 11% in the U.S. is an appropriate level. And I think as we go forward, that's the level you'll see from us. And I do think there is downward pressure, obviously, from some of the International markets. It doesn't make a lot of sense to spend a lot of money in Argentina or Venezuela at this point because we can't -- we're not going to spend a lot of money creating demand for products where we have modest margins, if any margin. So I think that dynamic continues to play into '14, but I do think 10% to 11% is the appropriate level in the U.S, and our eclectic portfolio, I think, says that's a pretty good rate to spend at.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Great. If I could just lob in one last one about Green Works. There's been a lot kind of discussed and written about that. You guys -- social network [indiscernible] Can you talk about the strategies there and the pretty large price reduction that accompanies that relaunch?","Donald R. Knauss","Yes. Ali, the relaunch is really anchored into one central idea, and the idea is green for all. And the idea of lowering the price to get it more competitive with traditional cleaners in general is this thought that you don't have to be wealthy or an environmentalist to have access to natural products, natural cleaning products. So that's kind of the central thought because if you look at our -- the competitive set and that it's more targeted to niche and elite or more wealthy consumers and, obviously, in channels that tend to be more oriented to those who are probably more financially well-off. So our whole focus here is \"How do we get this more broad based?  How do we get access to natural cleaning products for everybody?\" So that's the key point. Now having said that, I mean, Green Works is, at this point, less than -- it's about 1% of the company's revenue. We do think there is some upside, obviously, in getting some of these retailers who have cut distribution on Green Works over the last couple of years, as the sustainability focus waned in a number of retailers. We think there's a real opportunity as this pricing comes down. And we're really -- we haven't changed our margin structure on the products as we've taken the pricing down. We've reengineered the products. We've kept the natural percentage at the 98% to 99% range, which is the most natural in the space. But we've reengineered the products. So we've learned a lot. And so we kept the margins about where they were while lowered the prices. So I think we've got another shot at this thing in terms of repositioning it as a real mainstream cleaner.","Operator","Will take our next question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","First, just want to follow up on SG&A. I know you mentioned both the lower IT spending but also the compensation expense. Can you just maybe give us a little more granularity on how those 2 add up? In particular, I'm thinking about the next year, when I need to model this quarter, thinking about how the compensation expense could impact the comparison.","Stephen M. Robb","The -- that's a tough one. What I would say is that the compensation accruals in fiscal '12 in the same period were much higher than what we've got in fiscal '13. And so that's why you're seeing a change. And that accounts for a good piece of the change in the SG&A, call that 1\/3, maybe a bit more. You've also got a pretty good chunk because we're starting to lap some of the IT-related investments and other things in there. I can't -- it's very difficult to comment on compensation accruals for next year because it really depends on how we perform relative to the goals we have for sales, as well as for economic profit growth. I would just say that as you think of the SG&A outlook for fiscal '14, this year, we think we'll be about 14.5% of sales. Next year, we fully expect to be less than 14.5% of sales and it's one of the things that should contribute to the EBIT margin expansion of 25 to 50 bps that we're projecting at this point.","Donald R. Knauss","Lauren, if this helps you, I think those -- the accruals on comp are still a little bit above average. So there's not like there's some drastic change in the accruals versus where we have been. So we're not -- it's not a significant amount. As Steve said, it's about 1\/3 or so, but it's not a significant amount in absolute dollars.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that does help a lot. And then -- so then really the rest of it is the comparison on the IT and R&D investment.","Stephen M. Robb","So I think IT and R&D are the biggest ones that I think we're seeing. But we also have some productivity initiatives that we're putting through to lower the SG&A expenses as well. So it's really all of those things combined. Again, you're going to see variability in SG&A across the quarters, depending on how International inflation plays out. The anniversary-ing of all of these onetime investments we're making, and certainly compensation accruals, as you get moved through the year, can move the number up and down. But the key is to focus on the full year. And for the full year, we would expect to be less than 14.5% of sales. We think there's good traction there. And long term, I would say long term, being over the next 24 months, we think we can get this number to 14% or less. And just recognize there'll be some variability across the quarters here.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on bleach. So you did -- I wanted to ask if you completed the rollout of the third region for compaction, if that was completed this quarter.","Donald R. Knauss","Yes, we finished it, Lauren, at the end of March.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So that also -- great, so when we think about just the bleach performance in the quarter, and I know you already talked about starting to see shares moving in the right direction from here anyway. But that still would have been a positive dynamic for volumes in the quarter, right?","Stephen M. Robb","I think it's mixed. I think the conversion went about as we expected or within the -- private label followed and the -- I don't think -- it didn't certainly hurt the top line, but I wouldn't say that it was a big growth driver.","Donald R. Knauss","It wasn't much of a growth driver in the sense, Lauren, that the last region, which was the West Coast, the retail makeup and the section sizes on the West Coast are fundamentally different than the first 2 regions we rolled out, particularly through the Midwest part of the country and the Southeast, where we see larger store footprints, larger bleach categories, where the category development indices are higher on bleach. So it wasn't -- we didn't see as dramatic a boost on the West region as we did in the center part of the country, if you will, and the Southeast because the store footprints are just different.","Stephen M. Robb","I would point out, importantly, we are starting to see the cost savings flow. We certainly picked up a little of that in the third quarter. But by the fourth quarter, as we anniversary some of the onetime conversion costs we've been talking about, that's one of the reasons, we believe that we should see solid gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter, because we're going to lap those investments and start to enjoy some of the cost savings.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Greg Hessler with Bank of America.","Gregory Hessler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I think you guys had a $500 million note that matured in March. And I believe it was on the last earnings call where you may have mentioned that you plan to address that with a combination of cash and short-term borrowings. Is that kind of how that played out? And if you did use some short-term borrowings, do you plan to refinance that?","Stephen M. Robb","Good question. Yes, we did exactly what we said we were going to do. We used a combination of cash and short-term borrowings in the commercial paper market, which, as everybody knows, has very attractive rates to pay off the $500 million. We'd also prefunded at the last time we had issued debt in the fall. We had prefunded, so we had extra cash built up to cover for it. And at this point, we have no additional plans to bring any additional debt to market. We feel good about the debt structure that we've got. In calendar '15, we'll have more debt that will be maturing. And at that point, we'll take a look at what we want to do.","Operator","Our next question is from Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I also have a question on bleach. And that is -- we look at 4-week data and don't normally make much of it because it's a short period of time. So if Clorox liquid bleach is gaining share, and I guess you said 15 of 20 accounts, does that mean that you have regained shelf space -- is that what gives you confidence here?","Donald R. Knauss","Connie, just to be clear, the 15 out of 20 reference is that in the 4- to 5-week data, 15 of the top 20 customers have improved market share results versus the quarterly data. They aren't necessarily all increasing yet, but they're better than they were at the 13-week period.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And what do you attribute it to, though?","Donald R. Knauss","I think part of it, Connie, is getting back into the merchandising cycle. That's a big driver. I mean, this business does have, obviously, a strong base but it also has merchandising support that's critical, either on a quarterly basis or a couple of times a quarter. So I think it's just getting back into the merchandising cycle and not letting that cycle get too much tipped to private label.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, great. And then one -- just one follow-up on Venezuela. If the ongoing impact from inflation and the lack of pricing power is $0.08 in the June quarter and you've got $0.05 to $0.10 built in for fiscal '14 -- most of that, I assume will be in the first 3 quarters. If it's $0.08 now and $0.10 over the next 3 quarters, why would the conditions there improve?","Stephen M. Robb","Let me try to explain it like this. In fiscal '13, on a full year basis, we set aside $0.05 to $0.10. Of that $0.05 to $0.10, about $0.02 will be used to cover the balance sheet remeasurement that occurred in the third quarter. The balance will be used across the quarters to reflect the fact that we had a business that was once profitable, and we've had significant margin compression. And so the business has gone from profitability to breakeven to slight losses. And really, that's what's consuming the fiscal '13. As we look forward into fiscal '14, unfortunately, we don't see the situation getting better in the short term. So we are projecting losses in our Venezuela business in fiscal '14. And the $0.05 to $0.10 is really designed to cover for those losses as well as some challenges in our Argentina business as well. So I think that it's likely to spread across the full year, although the exact amount depends on what the government does with pricing in terms of letting companies take pricing. And then the only unknown piece that we have right now is whether there's going to be another devaluation. And if so, when and how much. And that is completely uncertain given the situation in  there, and we need more time to assess that.","Donald R. Knauss","Yes, our assumption, Connie, is on the operating environment there and the reason we've set this $0.05 to $0.10 aside, again, in '14 is we're assuming that there's going to be no relief on these price controls. And as Steve said, that just compresses your margins to basically nothing at the gross line. So we're trying to assume, if not the worst, I think a fairly realistic scenario that says this isn't going to get better in '14 and we better be prepared for it.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Yes, I guess my question is why it's only $0.05 to $0.10. If the impact is $0.08 in the June quarter, why isn't it more like $0.10 to $0.15 next year?","Stephen M. Robb","Yes. I'm sorry, I'm not following the $0.08 in the June quarter. The $0.05 to $0.10 for fiscal '13 is a full year number, okay? Of which $0.02 occurred in the third quarter and the balance has been -- is going to occur over a series of quarters, which should be Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Oh, okay. Great, I needed that clarification.","Stephen M. Robb","And I would also just say, being completely transparent with our investors about this, is we will be challenged in the first half of the fiscal year, unfortunately, because of the situation in Venezuela and Argentina. So a combination of foreign currency headwinds and a very difficult economic environment will continue to be a drag on both top line growth for our International business as well as profitability. So we think we're taking the right actions to mitigate the impact associated with this, including rightsizing our advertising investment. But obviously, this is a challenging situation.","Donald R. Knauss","Yes. And that's why in addition to the $0.05 to $0.10 on this Venezuela and Argentinian issue, that's why we also took 1 point of sales growth against the -- we would have come out with $0.03 to $0.05 on a currency-neutral basis but we came out $0.02 to $0.04 in the outlook because we wanted to recognize that Argentinian devaluation, which has slowly eked out over time. It's not like the government is taking a formal action like the Venezuelan government.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Erin Lash with Morningstar.","Erin Swanson Lash - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I wanted to talk about the Cat Litter business. You mentioned in the press release that Cat Litter shipments declined again this quarter, reflecting the price increase you took about a year ago. Obviously, price increases, you've mentioned that you tend to take those reflecting commodity cost increases and that sort of thing. Is there any -- I guess, do you feel that taking the price increase on Cat Litter was a good thing? Or what, I guess, is your strategic direction for that business given the challenging volume metrics that you've seen recently?","Donald R. Knauss","Well, I think, Erin, actually on the Cat Litter business, if you look at the quarter, while we saw some volume compression, we saw NCS, or net sales growth in the mid-single digit. So it looks like it's starting to recover, and that's certainly a sequential improvement. For year-to-date, we're up a little over 1% in sales. So we're almost triple that rate in the latest quarter. So I think we're starting to get some traction there. And if you look at the category, the category growth on litter, if you look at the last 13 weeks, and this is data ending in March, you're looking at 5.5% dollar growth. And while we have lost some share, we're starting to see some sequential improvement as we go into -- as we go -- I think we'll see some improvement as we go into April. So we're seeing some decent sales growth now, certainly at a higher rate than we saw year-to-date in the latest quarter.","Erin Swanson Lash - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful. And then just one other question. You talked on the call about the challenging economic environment and consumers being under pressure at home. And I was wondering if you could talk kind of about the different channel shift that maybe you're seeing and how you fill your positions in various channels that consumers -- a strained consumer may be shopping in now more so.","Donald R. Knauss","I'm sorry. Let me just clarify something, Erin, before we get into that question. The year-to-date number on Litter is actually north of 3%. So we've got a pretty good number year-to-date on that. So could you go back to your question, though, again?","Erin Swanson Lash - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Yes, yes. You talked about the fact that the consumer spending environment in the U.S. remains challenging. And so I was just wondering if you could talk about any of the -- any channel shift that you might be seeing from the consumer perspective.","Donald R. Knauss","Yes, one thing -- couple of things we're seeing. One is, and this is from panel data that we have, that fill-in trips are increasing and fill-in trips -- this is defining a trip as less than 15 or less items during the purchase. Fill-in trips now are 85% of the shopping trips that are out there and accounting now for almost $0.50 spent, so we're seeing -- that's clearly a change from, say, a couple of years ago. So people hopping around different channels, cherry-picking, if you will, and reducing the purchase size when they're hitting these channels. We're still seeing gravitation to value channels, whether it's the dollar channel, which has slowed a bit, as -- certainly as our largest customer has gotten more competitive in the last 15 months to 18 months. But we still see the club channel, the dollar channel and the mass channel continuing to really be fairly robust compared to the traditional grocer.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","I would like just to talk about your fiscal '14 guidance, the 25 to 50 basis points EBIT margin improvement, which is very similar to your -- it's kind of your default target. But you have already 25 basis points at least of margin expansion, which I believe is a sure thing because it has to do with the ramp-down of the IT and R&D spending. And it seems to me that you are less inclined to bake in gross margin expansion in 2014. And I wonder whether this is being conservative or you feel that you are taking too much pricing and given the consumer environment, you don't see enough justification to try to pass through the commodity increase of 100 basis points that you are calling for in your gross margin. So if you can help us understand whether there is a change in the business model, how you're going to drive earnings in 2014, meaning more from SG&A, less from gross margin expansion going -- at least for the full year.","Stephen M. Robb","So Javier, this is Steve. So first, let me say that we feel very good about the 25 to 50 basis points is our plan to expand gross margins, consistent with our long-term outlook. So it is certainly not a default position. So as you think about our EBIT margin expansion of 25 to 50 basis points, there's a couple of reasons why the gross margin will be a bit more challenged next year versus what you might expect over the longer term. And really, the biggest thing I would point to is our International business. We would like to take more pricing in Venezuela and Argentina. Unfortunately, we can't. And so right now, we've got good plans to expand gross margins on the U.S. side of the business. But the challenge is is we're really struggling to be able to take pricing internationally. And certainly that's placing a drag on the gross margins versus what you might expect to see on an ongoing basis. Now that said, we continue to believe we have leverage on SG&A, and we've got good plans to drive productivity improvements and cost savings and, as you say, anniversary some of the infrastructure-related costs. So we do think that SG&A will drive more of our EBIT margin expansion in fiscal '14. I think longer term, you would expect that both gross margin and EBIT margin should grow together. But we do have some unique challenges that we are facing into fiscal '14.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","But as this commodity increase that you are calling, right, that you have great visibility because of your long-term buying programs, you're saying that your fiscal '14 does include already price increases? So if it does include price increases, why your gross margin are going to be still below those that you had in 2011? Why is it that it is difficult to come back to higher gross margin?","Donald R. Knauss","You may have missed this earlier. But what I said is if you look at the U.S. business, which is 75 -- U.S. Retail business, which is 75% of the company's mix, there's virtually no pricing in that next year. So if there's any pricing at all in the P&L, there may be some modest pricing in International outside of Venezuela and Argentina, where we can take no pricing -- so virtually no pricing. So there's very little, if any pricing, in the P&L. I think that's the change. When you're looking at commodities up 100 basis points and other inflation up about 100 basis points and you're looking at cost savings at about 150 basis points, we've got a very modest build in there from pricing, which I think is prudent and\/or from mix improvement. So that's kind of your offset. You've got a couple of hundred basis points of pressure and a couple of hundred basis points potentially of offset. So you're basically in this flattish area. And I don't know if I'd define that -- I don't know if I describe that as conservative. Perhaps it is. I think I'd describe it more as realistic at this point.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","No, I understand. I mean, you mentioned that the consumer environment, I just was trying to see whether you have built price increases in the U.S. or not given whether this level of inflation in itself at limbo, that it's hurting but it's not enough to justify a price increase to retailers. That's what I meant.","Donald R. Knauss","Yes. And I think the way you just said it is the right way to think about it, Javier, that we don't think, given where commodities are, that it warrants a price increase for the most part and going into retailers and trying to persuade them. Unless we have a particular innovation that warrants it, then I think we're pat and saying no, we're going to -- we're really going to focus on holding -- really focusing on price value.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Quick housekeeping item. Did I hear you lower your CapEx guidance for the full year to $180 million?","Stephen M. Robb","You certainly did. We brought the CapEx down to about $180 million. And it really is just a reflection in part of lowering some of our spending expectations for International, given some of the dynamics in that market. And we're also just tightening up the spending to try to get that free cash flow back to where we think it needs to be, which is around 10% to 12% free cash flow as a percentage of sales over the long term. And this year, we think we'll be right around 10%.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So you're kind of curtailing your CapEx a bit. You're not buying back many shares and you're starting to see the option creep as a result and you're running down net debt. How should we think about your use of the balance sheet going forward?","Stephen M. Robb","I would say we're pretty consistent in our uses of cash. We've been focused on, obviously, supporting the organic growth of the business and paying off the $100 million approximately that we invested for the bolt-on acquisitions. We're going to continue to look to support the dividend and the growth of the dividend. That will be something that people should expect.","Donald R. Knauss","Yes. I think if I could just jump in on that one, Jason. I think we have our board meeting coming up in 2 weeks, and this is the traditional time of the year where we'll revisit the dividend with the board. So you should expect some news come out of that board meeting in a couple of weeks.","Stephen M. Robb","And then we've also been focused on, as we've talked for a while, not just the infrastructure investments in terms of funding those, but also paying the debt down. We were above our debt-to-EBITDA ratio for quite a while. We've gotten that down into, call it, the lower end of the debt-to-EBITDA ratio. So I think the good news, as we anniversary the infrastructure investments, the debt is back down to more normalized levels. Our expectation is we'll probably start building up on cash. And to Don's point, consistent with what we've done for many years now, is we'll look to get that back to our shareholders in some way that makes sense. Certainly we'll take a hard look at the dividend in partnership with the board. And I think at some point, we'll go back and look at share repurchases as a way of returning cash back to our shareholders. But again, that's one of the benefits of the company as we do throw off a lot of cash, and I think our options will open up as we go forward over the next 12 months.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So I should not interpret this as you guys building a coffer to go out with more aggressive M&A?","Stephen M. Robb","We will continue to focus on bolt-on acquisitions that we can fund out of cash and commercial paper. That doesn't mean that we're -- we can't let the debt-to-EBITDA ratio go down to the lower end of the range or even slightly below to build up some dry powder. But at the end of the day, if we don't foresee a need in use of the cash, over time, we will look for ways to get that back to our shareholders.","Donald R. Knauss","But just to be clear, Jason, I think you're correct and there's -- what I want to be declarative about is we're not looking at any transformational acquisition. As Steve said, what we're talking about here is bolt-ons like we've done over the last couple of years. So just to be clear on that point.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Chris Ferrara with Bank of America.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'll try and keep it quick. Just back to trying to size the order of magnitude of the weather-related hit to the Charcoal versus the benefit you got in cold and flu. Look, I mean -- if you look at scanner data sales, right, it looks like the amount you lost year-to-date in dollars year-on-year on Charcoal is a little bit lower than the amount you gained in things like Disinfectant and Wipes. And I guess I'm just trying to understand, is that right? Like what's your take on that? Is that the wrong way to think about it? Like why shouldn't I think of cold and flu as as big a benefit to the quarter as maybe the Charcoal weather-related hit was a detriment?","Stephen M. Robb","Disinfecting Wipes business was certainly up -- it was up nicely. I think as we said at the beginning of the call, the Charcoal, unfortunately, was down pretty significantly. So from the sales standpoint, you -- fair enough, you got Disinfecting Wipes up, you got Charcoal down. I would say, however, from an earnings per share standpoint, this is really important because we missed the consumption period in March. And unfortunately, April has had some pretty poor weather, and we're missing some consumption there. That the $0.06 of diluted earnings per share impact that we saw in the quarter, that will fall through to the full year. So I think there's some put and takes in the quarter. But...","Donald R. Knauss","Let me say it this way to you, too, Chris. I think if you look at other sales growth, forget the scanner data for a minute, looking at what drives the P&L, if you're looking at the hit from Charcoal in sales in the quarter, it was double the gain in Home Care for the quarter. So that -- we like -- to Steve's point, 1.5 point of growth for the entire company is about $20 million in the quarter. So when you look at that, it was -- that was double the gain of Home Care. So Home Care did not offset.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Jason Gere with RBC Capital Markets.","Jason M. Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just 2 questions. I have a housekeeping and then more strategic. The housekeeping is, I'm not sure if you broke down the difference on the sales line between price and mix for the quarter, if you could talk about that and maybe the trends, how that -- maybe that was influenced by Charcoal. And then the more strategic question is, when you look at the organic sales numbers that you guys have been delivering, if you look at last quarter, where, obviously, you delivered a very high number on a very tough comparison. For the most part, you guys have been averaging between 3% and 4%. So I'm just wondering if, internally, you guys ever think about especially with category growth still in that 1% range.  Is it more prudent to go with a long-term or at least a near-term sales target of more like 2% to 4% rather than a 3% to 5%?  And just considering your geographic mix how it's in there, given 2% to 4% for being a predominantly U.S. company is not too shabby. But I was just wondering about -- I'm not saying the expectation is too high for yourself.","Donald R. Knauss","Yes. Well, let me start on this, and then I'll let Steve jump in. I think that when you look at the way we built that 3% to 5% up over time, it was always based on 2 points of growth from new products, 1 to 2 points from category and then 1 point or so from pricing and\/or mix. So that got us into this 4% to 5% range. When the categories collapsed a bit a few years ago, and it went from growing 1 to 2 to being basically flat to down 2, we said we've got to redouble our efforts on innovation. So this year we should deliver another year of 3%-plus in innovation as we did last year. So we think we've made up the slack of the categories going down to more of a 1% level. So if you take 1% from category, 3% from new products and any pricing or mix improvement, we should be in this 4% to 5% range. Now that's currency neutral. It was always predicated on being currency neutral. If there's more significant currency headwinds in there, then that, obviously, takes off from that. So that's the real wildcard in this. If not a currency-neutral basis, we think 3% to 5% is appropriate. 2% to 4% is more appropriate if we're going to get 1 point of headwind out of FX.","Stephen M. Robb","And then just on your question regarding price\/mix, price\/mix in the third quarter was about 2 points. So 2 points positive. And to Don's point, 2% to 4% is the right outlook to be using for fiscal '14 given the foreign currency headwinds and given the fact that it's likely we'll have less pricing in part because of price controls and in part because in the U.S. Retail business we're likely to take less pricing, unless we see some major shift in the inflationary environment.","Donald R. Knauss","The only other thing I would add to that is if you look at some of the growth engines of the company right now, and albeit they're a bit smaller, Burt's Bees, for example.  The margin structure of Burt's is significantly better than the company average. If you look at our Healthcare business, which is also growing in double digits, that is slightly better than the company average. So you look at that and you start to say, \"Maybe there's a little bit of mix tailwind in here as well.\" So that's why we felt confident that would -- on a currency-neutral basis, 3% to 5% was still appropriate.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Knauss, I would like to turn this program back to you.","Donald R. Knauss","Yes. Well, just to -- just thanks to everyone for attending the call. Like I said, I think we feel good about the quarter given the headwinds we've experienced, and certainly about the year-to-date performance.

And welcome to The Clorox Company Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Earnings Release Conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference.","Lisah Burhan","Thanks, Sharon and welcome, everyone. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, our Chairman and CEO; and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet, and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our Web site, thecloroxcompany.com.","On today's call, we'll refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including, but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enable investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations.","Reconciliations with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available on our Web site, as well as in our SEC filings. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release.","Please also recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. I would direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to the tax legislation. Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcome to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.","I'll start by covering our Q2 top line performance discussing highlights in each one of our segments. Kevin will then address our financial results and outlook. Finally, we'll turn over to Benno to offer his perspective and then close with Q&A. For the total company, Q2 sales grew 4%, reflecting about 3 points of unfavorable foreign currency impact due mainly to the devaluation of the Argentine peso and about four points of benefit from the Nutranext acquisition.","I will now go through our result by segment. In our cleaning segment, Q2 sales grew 6% behind strong results in all three business units. Cleaning segment sales growth was once again lead by homecare, benefiting from strong innovation across the portfolio, including the new products on Clorox Scentiva platform. We recently launched Clorox Scentiva disinfecting wet muffing cloths marking the entry of the Scentiva platform into this category. That will be the first branded muffing cloth to provide disinfecting benefits along with the Clorox cleaning efficacy and Scentiva sensorial experience consumers have come to love.","Homecare is also a business where we have taken pricing across a substantial part of the portfolio. Pricing actions are progressing according to plan with market shares growing in key categories where we had increased prices last quarter. We continue to support this business with meaningful investments in advertising and sales promotion, with strong ROIs that have doubled since 2016, driven by the scale and quality of our digital marketing.","Our laundry business also grew sales strongly in the quarter with higher shipments of Clorox liquid bleach. Just as in homecare, implementation of price increases is going well. While competition has not followed our pricing actions as anticipated, total liquid bleach share was up nearly 1 point in the last 13 weeks in tracked channels. This is only possible because we invest strongly in our brands and the benefit of our recent price increase will allow us to continue doing so and drive long-term category health.","Lastly, within the cleaning segment, our professional products business grew sales, supported by broad-based double-digit volume growth. We continue to bring Clorox strength and innovation and brand building into this space and recently re-launched our offering as Clorox pro, a new mega brand encompassing both the business industry different healthcare products and commercial cleaning products, positioning it for continued momentum and to drive scale.","Turning to the household segment. Q2 sales decreased 4%, reflecting the clients in glad, Charcoal and RenewLife, partially offset by gains in Cat Litter. Charcoal sales decreased in the second quarter, primarily due to a shift in the timing of shipments from Q2 to Q3 in support of an early season customer program, as well as continued lower consumption. As a remainder, Q2 is a relatively small quarter for this business, representing less than 10% of annual shipments. Our focus now is on implementing the aggressive plans we introduced in last quarter for the 2019 grilling season. Those plans, which are well underway into stepping up our brand building programs to reenergize existing consumers, as well as bring new consumers into the category.","We\u2019re also making significant packaging upgrades that include new sizes and strong claims. On the innovation front, we will be launching 100% hardwood briquettes to address some consumers' preferences for different grilling methods. And will be focused on partnering with our retailers to aggressively merchandize Kingsford, including extending the grilling seasons, which has worked so well in driving of the growth for so many years.","In conjunction with these plans, we begin rolling out a cost justified price increase in December. We remain confident that these steps will help raise the overall value for the category, allowing us to reinvest in brand building, including innovation that will maintain the superior value of the Kingsford brand.","In Glad bags and wraps, sales declined mainly as a result of lower shipments of food storage products, as well as lower shipments of trash bags due to an increased price gap compared to our competitors who did not follow our recent price increase. As you know, we're deeply committed to deliver in superior consumer value. Our back half plans include promotional activities aimed at defending our share position.","Longer-term, we're confident that we can drive profitable growth in this business, as we have a successful track record of trading consumers up to our premium patent and trademark protected innovations, which remain our strongest competitive advantage. Our latest initiatives include leveraging our intellectual property, such as lip guard and ForceFlex Plus to support stronger claims and developing more effective advertising.","In RenewLife, sales were down driven mainly by an overall category decline. That said, we continue to make progress in this business as we saw share growth in Q2 with largest national retailer in the Natural Channel for this first time in two years, any e-commerce the fastest growing channel where we had double-digit volume growth in Q2. We're also encouraged by early results of our initiatives to at scale by co-merchandizing Nutranext with RenewLife brands, which has already began to yield a significant lift in sales during merchandizing events.","With our plans to continue leaning into e-commerce and innovation, as well as re-launch packaging featuring stronger claims, we'll keep driving this business and rebuilding momentum. A continued bright spot within household segment, our Cat Litter business had another strong quarter of double-digit sales growth supported by Fresh Step Clean Paws innovation, strong e-commerce growth and the benefit of price increases, which are now also reflected in all major competitive products. With additional Clean Paws innovation being introduced in the back half of the fiscal year, including unscented and a Mediterranean lavender scent, we're confident about the growth trajectory of this business.","In our Lifestyle segment, we grew sales in every single business. Segment sales grew 25% in Q2, mainly reflecting the Nutranext acquisition, which added about 21 points of benefit. Integration is going well with our flagship brands recently gaining national distribution at several major retailers, reflecting the difference that our customer capabilities are starting to make. We're also turning on the innovation machine, fee wheeling growth with this business with a steady stream of new products in the back half.","The Burt's Bees business saw strong sales growth with another quarter of double-digit shipments in lip care behind strong consumption, as well as innovation such as Burt's Bees conditioning lip scrub and Burt's Bees over night lip mask and continued strength in face care. This is in line with our strategy to drive profitable growth through a focus on our core segments. We told you last quarter. We're taking a cost specified price increase in the portion of the Burt's Bees portfolio effective this month. Selling is generally on track with our expectation with new pricing expected to be in effect at major retailers starting today.","Food sales grew strongly in Q2, mainly behind shipments of hidden valley ranch dry dressings despite price increases implemented last quarter. We are continuing to build on the Hidden Valley ranch equity, which grew share for a 16th consecutive quarter. One of the ways we are doing that is through innovation that is on trend, capitalizing on consumer interest in Hidden Valley for uses other than salad dressing. In fact, over two thirds of bottle occasions are for these alternative uses, as tipping sauce, topping or spread. Now based on this insight, we will be introducing a ready to eat dip in the back half, supported by strong brand building investments. With this product, we are looking to play in the new segment with stronger tailwinds compared to the dressing category.","Finally, within the lifestyle segment, Brita had its third consecutive quarter of solid sales growth with the stream pitcher and filter innovations continuing to perform well and our market share is starting to improve. We are optimistic about building on that success in the back of the fiscal year.","We've recently introduced our new Brita premium filtering water bottles, which are now available in e-commerce channels. While it's early, we are excited to see that they are already generating great reviews.","Finally, turning to our international segment. Sales decreased 8% as the benefit of price increases was more than offset by about 16 points of unfavorable foreign currency impact. Strong Go Lean strategy executions, including pricing and cost savings initiatives, provided a significant offset to the considerable FX headwinds. In particular, our Burt's Bees international business had a strong quarter with double digits volume growth and strong performance generally across the board.","Now, I'll turn it over to Kevin who will discuss our second quarter financial performance and outlook for FY'19.","Kevin Jacobsen","Thank you, Lisah and thank you everyone for joining us today. We are pleased to deliver another quarter of strong sales growth and return to gross margin expansion. Importantly, we remain on track to deliver our fiscal year 2019 outlook. I will address that in a moment.","Turning to our financial results for the second quarter. Sales grew 4%, which included 4 points of benefit from Nutranext acquisition, partially offset by 3 point of negative impact from foreign currencies. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 43.7%, an increase of 70 basis point compared to 43% in year ago quarter. Second quarter gross margin included the benefits of 220 basis points from pricing and 140 basis points from cost savings, partially offset by 190 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs and 120 basis points of unfavorable commodity costs.","I would like to note that a little more than half of the expansion in our second quarter gross margin was driven by a shift in spending in our supply chain, which we expect to reverse out in the second half of the fiscal year.","Selling, administrative expenses as a percentage of sales came in at 14.3% versus 13.9% in the year ago quarter, reflecting Nutranext integration expenses. Advertising and sales promotion investment levels as a percentage of sales came in at about 10%. We are spending for U.S. retail business at a healthy 11%. Our second quarter effective tax rate came in at about 19% versus about minus 3% in the year ago quarter when we benefited from a significant one-time reduction in our tax rate as a result of U.S. tax reform. Net of all these factors in our second quarter, we delivered diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.40 versus a $1.77 in the year ago quarter, a 21% decrease due to lapping a one-time $0.40 benefit from U.S. tax reform in the year ago quarter.","Turning to year-to-date cash flow. As we noted in our press release, net cash provided by continuing operations increased 39% to $449 million, primarily from lower tax payments as a result of U.S. tax reform.","Turning to our full fiscal year, we are pleased to confirm our sales and earnings outlook. Our fiscal year sales outlook continues to be in the range of 2% to 4%, now reflecting about 3 points of negative impact from unfavorable currencies. As I mentioned last quarter, we anticipated more pronounced currency headwinds, primarily from the devaluation of the Argentine peso. Our sales outlook also now includes about three points of net benefit from the Nutranext acquisition, which is running slightly ahead of plan and the Aplicare divestiture. And as we mentioned in our press release, our fiscal sales outlook continues to assume about 3 points of incremental sales from our innovation program. We have a robust pipeline of new products in the second half of the fiscal year, which we plan to support with strong demand building investments to drive awareness and trial.","Turning to fiscal year gross margin, we continue to expect fiscal year gross margin to be about flat as the benefits of pricing and cost savings are expected to be offset by increased cost and currency pressures. We remain on track to deliver gross margin expansion in the second half of the fiscal year, although at a more muted rate given the shift in supply-chain spending to the back half. Other assumptions that are unchanged in our fiscal year 2019 outlook, include fiscal year advertising and sales promotion spending at about 10% of sales, selling and administrative expenses at about 14% of sales and EBIT margin to be down, reflecting our expectations for flat gross margin, as well as our plans to complete the Nutranext integration and invest strongly in advertising to support our strong back half innovation plans. And finally, free cash flow of about 11 to 13% of sales.","As we mentioned in our press release, our assumptions for our fiscal year tax rate did change and is now expected to be in the range of 22% to 23%. Net of all these factors, we continue to expect fiscal year diluted EPS to be in the range of 6.20 to 6.40, reflecting our estimate of $0.08 to $0.12 of EPS dilution from the Nutranext acquisition in addition to $0.05 to $0.07 of negative impact from tariffs, which are affecting a couple of our business units.","In closing, we are very pleased with our second quarter performance and our overall first half results. Strong execution of our strategic plans from pricing to agile initiatives is helping us address continued cost and foreign exchange pressures. With our pricing actions largely behind us consistent with our 2020 strategy we can now shift our focus to investing in demand creation, including our strong innovation programs to sustain our core business and deliver long-term shareholder value.","And with that, I'll turn over Benno.","Benno Dorer","Thanks Kevin, and thanks everyone for being on the call. Let me share my three key messages for you today. First, I\u2019m pleased with our first half results with the second quarter delivering strong sales growth and a return to gross margin expansion.","Our sales increase to 4% is especially strong considering we absorbed about 3 points of unfavorable foreign currencies, primarily from the devaluation of the Argentine peso in the last fiscal year. Clorox continues to sustain top line momentum, demonstrating our ongoing ability to win with consumers. We are differentiating our products and brands through innovation, investing strongly in ROI based marketing communications and leveraging our strength in e-commerce, which we continue to expect to grow strongly and be about 8% of company sales for fiscal year.","The Nutranex acquisition also contributed strongly to total company sales and continues to be accretive to the company's gross margin. Integration remains on track and we're pleased about expanded national distribution at several major retailers. I\u2019m also very pleased that we expanded gross margin in the second quarter as rebuilding our margins is an ongoing priority and our focus on good growth, growth that is profitable, sustainable and responsible.","My second point is that Clorox continues to execute strongly against our strategic priorities. As you know, Clorox leaned into pricing early to address increased cost pressures. As Kevin noted, we have now completed most of our pricing actions, which have been executed with excellence and with our pricing actions mostly behind us, we can focus on growing our categories and brands that are long-term. We will invest strongly in marketing communications to maximize innovation platforms and drive awareness and trial of new products across our portfolio in the second half of the fiscal year.","Importantly, last quarter I said we would leave no stone unturned in our focus to rebuild margin and we did deliver. Clorox people stepped up to drive margin accretive innovation, execute our pricing plans and lean into our agile initiatives for cost savings.","Finally, my last point is that we remain confident in having the right strategy to drive long-term shareholder value. Our 2020 strategy has been the bedrock of our focus on long-term profitable growth. Clorox has continued to deliver strong growth and shareholder returns in an environment where growth is hard to come by because of our relentless emphasis on strategic clarity supported by agile decision-making and strong execution.","And while we are still closing out the current strategy, we also have our sight set on the future. As we finalize the successor to our 2020 strategy, I can tell you we will continue to lean into critical areas. First, serving our consumers and delivering superior value will continue to underpin everything we do. Innovation continues to be our lifeblood and sets us apart. We will continue to lean more deeply into our proven innovation capabilities to win in the marketplace, particularly in a dynamic omni-channel retail environments. Second, transforming how we work to be an even more agile, decisive organization that executes with excellence and leverages technology to drive competitive advantage will be critical to supporting a culture focus on growth.","And finally, as a mission driven business, we will continue to focus on good growth, creating long-term value for all our stakeholders by living our values and ensuring corporate responsibility is embedded in our business. We look forward to introducing our updated strategy to you in early October.","to you in early October. ","Thank you. Operator you may now open up the line for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.","Steve Powers","So I guess just to start. Obviously, you had a strong quarter and there's the lower tax rate in the full year guide. And I get that there's were seeing effects, but you've also got strong pricing and incremental contributions from Nutranext. So, I guess just within the outlook. What's the negative offset in the back half that's not allowing a full-year guidance raise at least at the low-end? And I guess within that, is it the increased promotion that you've called out today in household care that's disallowing that upside from flown through?","Kevin Jacobsen","What I would say, as you mentioned, tax rates a little bit better. I wouldn\u2019t read too much into that. I'd view that more as a minor tune-up. At the end of last quarter, I anticipated we'd be slightly above 23%. I think we'll now be below 23%. So I've tightened up that range. And then I'll say that as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we do think the FX environment is a little bit worse, particularly in Argentina. And so I think within our range, those are both fairly offsetting and it allows us to maintain our outlook for the year.","Steve Powers","And I guess just given the -- I mean, I think the topic that's on a lot of folks' minds, just given the oil prices as a benchmark, for example, are back to where they were in the fall of '17 when the inflation headwinds that are just defining current price increases started. Is there a concern that what you're seeing in household care is specifically in bags and wraps with competitors not following. But we're seeing it a little bit in charcoal and other places as well. Is that a bellwether for other categories that you may have to promote back some of this recent price increases going forward more broadly? How does that factor into your thinking?","Kevin Jacobsen","As it relates to commodities and specifically oil, I would say for us because we primarily source resin from the U.S., it's much more driven by supply and demand and driven by nat gas than oil. And so I would say as we talk maybe broadly about pricing, as both Ben and I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we feel very good in aggregate about our ability to execute pricing and how it's playing out in the marketplace.","The one exception that I would say is on our bags and wraps business. And what I'd tell you is when we start our planning back in May, June, we had a certain expectation for the resin market. Sitting here today I would tell you, while resin is still going to be inflationary, we are seeing softening-up in international demand. And my expectation now is we will not see the same level of resin increase that we anticipated when we took the pricing. And so specific to the Glad business, I think we will spend some money back to defend share in the near-term on the Glad business specifically. But what I'd tell you is that's something we know how to do. We've done it quite often specifically on Glad. We used trade spending managed resin prices.","I would say broadly everything else in commodity is playing out as we expected. And then I would say that's true for pricing, as well with the exception of Glad I think we will do some work there. Important to note though, because we will spend a little bit more money back on Glad, we're also seeing a slightly less commodity headwinds that will fund that. So we're no worse off as it relate to margin and profit, but something we will do in the back of the year.","Steve Powers","I just wanted, maybe one quick clean up, just the inventory level exiting December, it is more elevated than we've seen in a while just measured in days. How much of that is you building inventory ahead of new product launches in the second half given the strong innovation pipeline versus maybe being less with excess inventory in some of those household categories. It didn\u2019t see as much sell through in December. Just trying to get underneath that inventory spike for lack of a better word?","Benno Dorer","So if you look at our attachment, you can see our inventory levels, they were 53 days at the end of Q2 they are 59 days now. We're up a little bit. I would say the bulk of that is Nutranext. Keep in mind Q2 last year Nutranext not one of our portfolio. So that\u2019s the bulk of the increase in inventory. And then because we have such a strong innovation pipeline in the back half of this year, we did pre-build in preparation for launching in innovation, so that explains a bulk of the rest of it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","I just had a couple of questions on your Charcoal business. First, could you guys quantify the amount of the shift you saw in Charcoal, maybe from Q2 that you are expecting to move into Q3? And then did the change in timing of this shipments impact your gross margin in Q2? Or do you guys expect it to maybe impact gross margins in Q3?","Kevin Jacobsen","Bonnie, what I would say is the bulk of the movement in Charcoal is based on just the timing of the shipment. Keep in mind shipping between December and January that moves all the time. We're shipping and preparation for early-season merchandising. So we anticipated going December, it actually is going to in January, but for the year that creates no impact to the results. And then the second question was beyond timing of shipments?","Bonnie Herzog","Just trying to get a sense of how much of an impact that could be on gross margins just some of this timing in your shipments for that business?","Kevin Jacobsen","Yes, it won't have much impact on margin. Charcoal is pretty close to the company average. So I wouldn\u2019t expect to see much change in margin as it shifts between quarters.","Bonnie Herzog","And then could you guys talk a little bit further about some of the innovation that you bring into the market place. Just in terms of what we're seeing with the slowdown in trends and how you expect some of this innovation to resonate better than maybe some of your existing product?","Benno Dorer","Keep in mind that what you're seeing in tracked channels less and less reflects what we are seeing on a total business right. So I would take what you categorize as a slowdown with a grain of salt. But we are very excited about very strong innovation plan in the back half across all or most of our portfolio with notable innovations across the major brands. Lisah has mentioned a few of them, Scentiva as a platform in homecare. Our largest SBU continues to do extremely well. And we're launching a very differentiated product in the wet mopping cloth category that\u2019s a big category. And we will launch the first available product that combines the Clorox cleaning performance that people love with disinfecting, which is not available in this category today, but also the sensorial experience that Scentiva delivers and that\u2019s an innovation into a new space for our oldest brand that we are excited about.","So we are excited about Glad where we are expanding the latest technologies platform, which is backed up by about 40 patents across the portfolio and that of course is very timely on Glad. We're launching 100% hardwood briquettes on charcoal. We're starting to launch innovation across Nutranext brands. And we will continue to expand the clean paws platform on litter. And then last but not least super excited about food where we're launching into ready to eat dips, that's a category that's almost $2 billion in size and about the same size as salad dressing, so we're essentially doubling the access of the Hidden Valley brand, which continues to do extremely well, 16 quarters of share growth. And you three quarters of all the uses that we see on the Hidden Valley today are outside salad dressings. People use it on pizza, use it on chicken wings, or with healthy snacks and veggies. And the ready to eat dips are great premium products that's going to make that easy and that we're very excited about, both in terms of customer reaction as well as early consumption in market.","So we have long said that in the back half, we will return to investing strongly behind innovations, and that's why it was very important for us also to do pricing early. Because as Kevin noted, in particular it's now largely behind us and we have an organization that will now focus on growing our brands and growing categories for retailers and doing that behind a really strong set of innovations and aggressive spending. So feel good about where we are and that's a big part of why we're sitting here today and able to confirm our outlook both in terms of sales and earnings. ","Bonnie Herzog","And then just one clarification on timing. It seems like what you just discussed, a lot of it will be back half weighted. But I get the sense that Q3, there'll be a fair amount of stepped up advertising and certainly promo support, just in terms of trying to drive trials. So maybe a little bit more of a drag on Q3 than what you're expecting in Q4? Maybe first question and then second, I think you mentioned this but a huge opportunity for you guys could be with this innovation, is also for you to privatize or drive trade-up within some of your different categories?","Benno Dorer","Maybe the last one first, Bonnie. Trade-ups hallmark of our company and we believe that consumers continue to be willing to reward us and pay for innovation that they see as value and the bulk of this innovation is in the premium segment, the bulk of this innovation also is margin accretive to us as a company, which is part of why we feel bullish about gross margin in the back half. So we continue to do a nice job to stay value focused, but capture value at the premium and through innovation. So that observation is certainly true.","And then in terms of you know quarterly spend, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily conclude that. The reality is that because of retail of shelf set timings and also because of our increasing focus to drive these innovation platforms with an eye on the long-term and not just in one quarter. You will see a strong spend for us across the back half, across both quarters. And I'm not in a position right now to predict whether one quarter is stronger than the other, but you'll see healthy spend for Q3 and Q4.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jason English","A couple questions, first I'm trying to get a better understanding of the price contribution this quarter versus the last quarter. We can clearly do some math on back half volume to try to get to organic price mix. On that math it suggests that price mix was about 200 basis points in the first quarter and again in the second. But clearly, the flow through to gross margin stepped materially in the second quarter. Is it fair to assume that the reason for is that absolute price grew substantially from 1Q to 2Q, and that there was a healthy mix benefit in the first quarter that stayed in the second. So is that thought process reasonable? And second if so, what drove the spike in the mix benefit in the first quarter that fed in the second?","Kevin Jacobsen","As it relates to price mix, here's what I'd tell you. We actually don\u2019t spend a lot of time talking by price mix, because I think that really only represents about half of the impact we take pricing. And so you take pricing, there is really two implications. One, you generate more revenue per case. But with elasticities in the near term as consumers adjust to the price, you expect to see some volume pull back. Our history has been and what we expect for this round of pricing is when you look at both of those issues together, there's very little impact to the top line from pricing. One essentially offset the other in the year you take pricing.","And I would tell you us, that's pretty much how it's playing out through the first six months and frankly how I'd expect it to play out for the balance of the year. But as you know that's not why we're taking pricing. We're taking it because we\u2019re trying to address the cost and currency headwind that we have to face and allow us to continue investment in the brands. And so that's really the primary reason we\u2019re taking it. As it relates to the impact you\u2019re seeing, what I would say is you look at Q1, we got about 90 bps of gross margin accretion from pricing. And then this quarter, we got about 220. The reason why that improved is if you recall in Q1, really only Cat Litter was the only brand that had pricing in place for the entire quarter.","We started taking additional pricing in August and September across the bulk of the portfolio, and that's really why you see the greater impact to margin in Q2. And then what I'd expect going forward keep in mind, we've taken a price increase in charcoal and a portion of Burt's Bees are not in these results. So I would expect some continued strength in the back half of the year from pricing as it relates to gross margin as you fully reflect the benefits of those two additional pricing actions.","Jason English","So mix contribution to sales didn\u2019t change between the first and second quarter?","Kevin Jacobsen","No, Jason. What I'd tell you is as it relates to pricing. Pricing is generating very little benefit to revenue. And we're really getting the benefits. If you look as an example in Q2, 4 points from Nutranext and 3 points of revenue growth from our base business primarily focused on innovation, that\u2019s really what's driving the top line, it's not pricing.","Jason English","I will another question then. On the U.S. business in aggregate, organic sales decelerated from the first quarter despite a substantially easier comparison. I you we walked through a few puts and takes at the individual segment level. But high-level, can you give us some of the key drivers of what drove the deceleration, particularly to your stack basis?","Kevin Jacobsen","I don\u2019t see that same data, Jason. Our base business grew about 3%, both Q1 and Q2. So I\u2019m not sure what you are looking at, but that\u2019s not the perspective we have on the performance of the business.","Jason English","Okay, it was just -- it's from your part of results. But I will follow up with these offline. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Strycula of UBS.","Steven Strycula","I was curious for the renewal life in charcoal business, sounds like you have some initiatives underway for the back half of the year. Do you think that those businesses can grow, particularly charcoal as you put through some pricing, get the shipment benefit and then you lap easy weather? That will be my first question, and then I have a follow up.","Benno Dorer","First of all, today, no major news versus the November update that we gave, because our improvements are really focused on the 2019 calendar year grilling season. So Q2 is clearly is somewhat soft, Kevin explained it primarily due a shift in timing as is related to an early-season customer program. Keep in mind that Q2 is really small with less than 10% of fiscal year shipments. I would say that we would expect the rest of this fiscal year to be better clearly than Q2, albeit it's probably not all of the way to where we wanted to be.","Pricing will help. Significant packaging upgrade will help. The 100% hardwood briquettes launch in the back half will help. Better retailer merchandising will help. And then there is the weather components, which I find hard to predict. But last year, clearly, wasn't a great year. But I would say that's plus pricing should enable us to do better for the rest of the fiscal year. And then my hope would be that as we think about the total 2019 calendar year relative to 2018 that we should see a market improvement on that business as a result of all of this activity that I was just describing.","Steven Strycula","And then a follow-up question for Kevin to Steve Powers' question on inventories. On a year-over-year basis, you were up $85 million and the RenewLife business, my understanding is it's about $200 million business. So I'm just trying to understand that seems like a big contribution the year-over-year build of inventory. Is there anything else from an inventory shipment perspective that we should think about or finished goods that are ready to come into market in the third and fourth quarter for to support and innovation?","Kevin Jacobsen","Steve, I'd say a few things. One, it is primarily Nutranext, as I've mentioned. And as you could imagine, it's a fairly new business that we've owned less than a year. There's some real opportunities for us to rationalize inventory, so that we see that as an opportunity going forward. And then also we do have some innovation coming on Nutranext. So there is some pre-build as well as we're preparing to launch some new products on that business.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Andrea Teixeira","So do you expect the household sales staying flat positively in the Q3? And I'm saying that because you called out some shelf space losses. So I'm wondering if you can reverse within this fiscal year with innovation and new displays. Or that's something that you're still going to be looking to use promotional dollars to reignite? Thank you.","Kevin Jacobsen","I mean without providing specific outlook for quarters and segments, which as you know Andrea, we would not want to do. Kingsford, we certainly would hope that the quarter relative to year ago is going to be better and what we talked about for Glad, and those are really the two big businesses that impacted Q2 sales negatively and household in frankly an environment where now we're talking those two businesses. But I would note that the rest of the businesses of course did very, very well. But I'm Glad we're starting to spend back some of the pricing goodness and promotions, and we should see that at minimum stabilize and ideally start to improve the trends that we're seeing. Again, not unusual to see these trends in a year where you take pricing in particular when resin costs now go the other way, and we're not seeing competition follow. So that's noise in the market that we've seen before and that's noise that we've also managed before. But I would expect Q3 to see improvements on both businesses, yes.","Operator","Next question comes from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy","I would like to come back to medical, gross margin commentary. So last quarter, the comment was you didn\u2019t expect to see improvement to the back half of the year and your comment was also some of this was timing and supply chain spending, which I think the comment was it drove half of it. The gross margins were still up in the quarter. So a little bit better seemingly than what you had planned. So if you could drill down a little bit on that? What was driving some of that? Is this just lower commodities? And then with respect to how this informs the view for year. It seems like maybe pricing trade spending a bit worse given the dynamic in Glad, commodities are bit better and then perhaps no change to manufacturing and logistics. Is that the right way to think about? I'm just trying to gauge the level of conservativism in the outlook, because it seems like the quarter certainly came in better than planned but yet, you are maintaining outlook.","Kevin Jacobsen","I would not say it's conservative. I think this is a balanced view of where we see the year landing. What I would say and you heard in my prepared remarks, little more than half of our gross margin expansion in Q2 was timing. We had some investments planned for some very long lead cost savings projects that are probably 12 to 18 months out in the future. And is not atypical to see some of that spending ship between quarters, and so that money will get spend in the back half of the year. And because of that, I just think the shape of our gross margin expansion will be a bit more consistent Q2 through Q4 as some of that money ships to the back half of the year. But for the most part I would tell you the items that we are monitoring within margin are playing out about as we expected, transportation, manufacturing cost savings, et cetera. There is probably going to be a little bit more FX headwinds as we mentioned as we have talked about the pressure on the top line from FX being closer to 3 point and 2, that will have a little bit of a margin impact.","I also mentioned I think the commodity environment will be a little bit more favorable than we anticipated, still a headwind but I do expect resin to lighten up a little bit in the back half. And so those are some of the items we are watching. But I guess bigger picture I would say the items that we can control, cost savings, pricing, admin, productivity, I would say all going very well and on track. But I do want be balance here. There is a lot of volatile items that are outside of our control, FX, commodities and currencies. So I think it\u2019s a prudent and balanced outlook at this point.","Kevin Grundy","And then one follow-up just with respect to capital deployment, share repurchases in the commentary there and the impact on guidance received a lot of attention last quarter. Any update there? And then in terms of what's included in your guidance. And then Benno maybe you could tie in M&A. And you've been pretty clear about areas of interest, personal care, food enhancers and health and wellness in the past. What are you seeing in terms of pipeline at this point? And are you prepared to transact there, should the right deal come along?","Kevin Jacobsen","I'll start with your question around cash return to shareholders. And maybe the perspective to be most helpful, I'll talk about our activities fiscal year-to-date. So halfway through the year, we've now returned about $500 million to shareholders, and that's been split almost equally between dividends and share repurchases. That's up about 75% versus the first six months of last year. And it's really driven by both the combination of, as you may recall, we took a 14% increase in the dividend last May that's certainly helping. And then we initiated our open market share repurchase program starting in May.","Specific to Q2, I repurchased about $38 million for the shares in the second quarter and assigned that all to the dilution management program. And so as it relates to the open market share repurchase program, no new activity in the second quarter. I'm still at about 9% of my total authorization. And I would tell you plans for the balance of the year hasn't changed from when we talked last quarter and those are certainly included in the outlook.","Benno Dorer","And then Kevin, your question on M&A. Obviously, we continue to generate a lot of cash. This was a very strong quarter in terms of cash flow, up 39%. And our business priorities overall continue to be the same. We continue to build our business from a core out, so maintaining and driving the strong core business continues to be our most important job. The second priority also continues to be to keep driving shareholder return with our vitamins, minerals and supplements business. We've got some work to do on RenewLife, but we certainly like the green shoots that Lisah was describing earlier. We also like that we're now able to drive scale, in particular with retailers around Nutranext, which is showing some very significant initial lift as we think about merchandising events. And Nutranext obviously is doing really well, so we're pleased with that.","But we continue to look at a lot of things M&A wise with our board. We can continue to pursue the same priorities. And should the right opportunity come along, and that means good business at the right price, we're absolutely willing to pull the trigger. But in the meantime, I think we're seeing that we could do quite well for our shareholders with the businesses that we have.","Operator","Next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","So, I'm a little confused about a few things that I'm hearing, would just love maybe to point through them for some clarification. So one is, I still have a tough time pinpointing why H2 is getting worse. I get the FX, I get Argentina. But it does seem like there's something that you're going to have to be investing in more. And I don't know if it\u2019s the supply chain investments, maybe that's what the answer, maybe magnitude of that. But it just feels like there's something else that's going on in terms of H2 that you're seeing perhaps you want to have some flex to invest in. I don't really understand 20%, 17%, 18%, inventory growth coming from business that's about 1% of your sale. I don't really get when you said earlier, Kevin, I think it was that top line isn't really being helped by pricing to Jason's question, which means elasticity is a negative one and you're doing it for gross margin. I am not sure how your retailers would feel about that. And then we still have the laundry business, 9% of sales and the Glad business 14% of sales, so about a quarter of your business not seeing the pricing come through like you thought. So I guess, I am sorry for the long lip, but I am just trying to figure out what's going on. And I'm just having trouble. Can you help on any of that?","Kevin Jacobsen","It's a long list, let me take a shot at a few and see if we can answer some of your questions. So as it relates to inventory, as you see in our attachments, it's up about I think $84 million quarter-over-quarter. And as I said, a good portion of that is the Nutranext acquisition. And if you've been around small business when you acquired them, there's lots of opportunity to drive improvements and I'd say this is just one opportunity to significantly rationalize that business. And that include skew rationalization, which would certainly lead to improved inventory levels. So I view that as certainly an opportunity for us. And that was the bulk of the change in inventory. So that's the business we acquired. It gives me plenty of opportunity to go after improvements. And I think we can drive that over time.","Another question you had us on the top line. Look, what I'd tell you, I'll step back and talk in aggregate versus anyone business. When we take pricing and as you know, Ali, we've taken a lot of pricing over the years. I don't expect much impact to the top line. When you net out price mix and volume at least in the near term that\u2019s first six to 12 months that has very little impact to the top line, but why we do that is because we have to recover the cost and currency headwind, because we want to keep investing in our business and to help grow categories. And so I think the retailers appreciate strong innovation that helps them grow their categories, that's the partnership we can offer. But to do that we have to cover the cost environment, and that's really why we're executing pricing. We are not executing pricing to drive the top line.","Benno Dorer","And maybe two additions, Ali, so helpful to be able to clarify these for the inventories; so I think it\u2019s clear to everybody that most of our orders; and most of our inventories are managed electronically with our retailers; so this all flows through so there is nothing strange going on. I want to be very clear here on the inventories are than the things that Kevin expected. And as a company, we pride ourselves in being efficient. And obviously the economic profit matters to us a great deal as everybody knows. So we manage inventories tightly and we certainly expect to continue to do that on our entire business, including Nutranext","And then perhaps just to close the loop on pricing. I want to be sure that we all understand that, Glad, our pricing was executed exactly in line with our expectations. So we see it full pass-through. But due to a change in the resin environments, we are now not seeing competition to follow. So we're temporarily spending back on promotions. And I also want to confirm that on laundry pricing in fact has gone through in line with expectations. And while competition has not followed, which we didn't expect in this one, I think we've also noted the top line growth in laundry and the strong performance also in terms of market share from Clorox liquid bleach. So I would want to make sure that we all understand that the laundry price increase along with all the other price increases are executed very well and are now going in line with plan.","Ali Dibadj","And then just on that point in particular around portfolio in general. And maybe this is not how you guys thinking about it. But how I think about your portfolio there is the core legacy business, laundry, bags and wraps. You guys were saying competition is not following, is not a big issue we\u2019re planning for that. To be fair, that worried me a little bit, but I get it. Then you have the international businesses, which is clearly doing better but still pretty volatile here even if you don't include the FX issue. And just on the recent acquisitions, particularly RenewLife, I was surprised to hear already declining. I understand you have some plans behind that. But that makes me a little concerned about your new acquisition declining. And Burt's another lifestyle is doing really well. How do you feel -- it feels like half of business is doing well, half of business is not doing well. How do you characterize the portfolio right now? And Ben for you the level of this much is right on planning doing well. This much isn\u2019t doing that well. I got to work on this and this. How would you characterize the portfolio in those terms?","Benno Dorer","So first of all, if you know of a company that does well 100% of the time with the 100% of their businesses. I would love to know who that is. So again set context, I would say that as we've noted, you think about this quarter. We have very strong performance on all businesses in clearing. We have very strong performance on all businesses in lifestyle. Household's litter continues to do very well. And then you have one business that's done super well for us in its first year, and we\u2019ve had some executional issues that are duly noted, but we're getting behind those and they are green shoots and that's RenewLife and we talked about Glad that Kingsford.","Clearly, Kingsford is one where we've got a good handle on the issue and we're fixing that. And on Glad, we are seeing temporary issues related to pricing that we've seen before, and then international. So at the end of the day, we're dealing with an FX issue that everybody is dealing, and that's mostly Argentina. We're growing 8% in U.S. dollars across the international business. We're growing profit in U.S. dollars in a very difficult environment. So I would look at the international business actually as doing really well, if you exclude the Argentine peso.","So you called 50%, 50%, that's not how we're looking at it. We like our portfolio and we like all our portfolio. We have expectations of every business unit to add to shareholder value. And if you look at it over the long run that's exactly what's happened. And you know, while it's not the case that 100% of the business is doing well, I also say that that gives us an opportunity to do better. I like it if there is businesses that we can fix and there is some of them that we can fix, because that gives us upside. But then again it's hard to feel bashful about how the company is doing when we're sitting at 4% sales growth and gross margin expansion and we're doing exactly what we said we were going to do.","So I feel good about the portfolio. And we have a firm handle on the few issues that exist, but the vast majority of the portfolio has done exceptionally well in Q2. And we expect continued strong performance, in particular behind all the innovation that we're focused on launching now in the back half.","Operator","Your next question comes from Olivia Tong of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong","I wanted to follow-up on advertising spend. I think you had always planned for advertising to pick-up in the second half, because of the innovation tick-up. But now that we're one quarter closer first is that still the plan, because you've been flattish as the percentage of sales, good first half and driving 3 points of organic sales growth getting price. Do you think increased advertising can drive an acceleration in sales off of the current pace? Or could there be other places to allocate funds, which you think may generate even greater returns?","Kevin Jacobsen","What I would say is your right. We've always planned for a heavier back half as it relates to advertising investments. We've got a pretty exciting innovation pipeline that we all have a lot of confidence in, and so we're going to support that driving awareness and trial. But I think it's really in the context of the outlook we provided that we think we've got the right investment level to support the innovation to deliver the outlook we've been talking about today.","Olivia Tong","And then if I could follow-up just in terms of the pricing, particularly on charcoal, and bags and wraps where competition didn\u2019t follow. Obviously, the commodities have turned now. But what else do you think allows them not to price? And do you think that puts them in a pretty tough position, because I just think like. Is it to say they are okay with lower margins in you? And if you have any insight into what allows if not to follow through and follow your pricing?","Benno Dorer","Yes, Olivia, good clarification on Kingsford. Kingsford pricing is still underway right. So you had remarked that competition is not following, so that's not the case. We are executing Kingsford now and that will be in place this spring. So we are really talking Glad where we are seeing our price increase executed excellence, but we are not seeing competition follow. And that's because we were out early and resin, as we all know, is very volatile and resin costs has softened since we came out with the price increase. So I want to be clear it's still a cost justified price increase. But the resin cost increase is less severe than we had anticipated. And because we were out first, we were out there with pricing and everybody else then didn't follow, because they probably saw that resin is softening. That's happened before and that's where we are addressing with promotional spend.","We like our strategy to continue to be focused in this category on trading consumers up, because consumers will not use more trash bags in the future, that's very unlikely. And what we've been on for a period of 15 years now is to effectively trade up consumers with innovation. So we like the mix of taking pricing on one end and rewarding consumers with great innovation backed by strong investments on the other ends. Which is why you saw that even in the quarter where Glad grew margins nicely and grew profits nicely, but where sales were down the core focus, which is our indoor differentiated OdorShield business actually grew volume and sales quite nicely. So that's straight up strategy. It's still working.","And I mentioned earlier, we have innovation coming out, it's backed up by solid patents that we are driving now. It is much easier to take pricing and also sustain pricing certainly in the long term. If you have innovation and if you support your brands and we are the only player in that category in trash that does that and that may be explaining the difference in spends that our competitors take as far as pricing is concerned, even though it would be hard for me to speculate. But we think that this combination of innovation backed by pricing continues to be the right strategy for our company even though temporarily we will now spend back on promotions.","Operator","Next question comes from Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Edge.","Jonathan Feeney","I wanted to ask about Burt's Bees natural personal care products overall. Where would you say you are in terms of total distribution versus where you'd like to be for the last 12 months of innovations, first off? Within that what have been the strongest channels for those innovations for the growth you are seeing? Is it more succeeding side by side and beauty displays? Or is it other places that as maybe the heritage of Burt's Bees has that in a little bit? And I noticed you laid out in your deck the pipeline of innovations, I didn\u2019t see any for Burt's Bees second half in '19. Are there plans for more natural personal care products for Burt's Bees that you didn\u2019t mention in there for '19 or for that matter beyond that?","Benno Dorer","So strong quarter for Burt's Bees, volume up, sales up high single digits, so feel good about that. The single most important driver continues to be lip care. Just the core lip business grew double digits, and that grew behind innovation and base. Face care also up high single digits, cosmetic up high single-digits, behind innovation and also a strong holiday business. Burt's Bees is a great business that's used for gifting by consumers. And we're always driving that with special gift packs and we did that well in the last quarter. So I'd say in terms of where we are on the business, we certainly continue to have opportunity to drive distribution around new products. We also have opportunity to drive the core business into wide spaces and we have a dedicated team driving that, whether that's convenience stores or other stores where we can drive what we call it lip ubiquity, getting lip balm in the vicinity of where the consumer might be interested in buying that everywhere she goes. So going forward, we feel good about this business and we do have innovation.","The fact that we haven't mentioned it maybe more of a factor of having so much innovation across the portfolio, and we have certainly called out Burt's Bees in the past quite a bit. But we have innovation mostly focused on lip, but also in skin care and face care, where we have a variety of masks coming out. Mask is a hot category and we have a detoxifying sheet mask, as well as a clay mask coming out. We have new a facial mist come out. And importantly, we will do TV on face care for the first time this back half, because we can now make the claim that our natural skincare products perform, as well as the synthetic creams out there. And that's a claim that we haven't been able to do before. And that's a claim that we can make based on independent dermatological testing and that we're excited about, because it resonates with consumers in a big way.","So that along with pricing, which is effective today, will make for really strong backup on Burt's Bees. And international, we have noted as well that the business is up double digits. And we feel good about the progress that we're making in international, particular in Asia. So we're staying the course on Burt's Bees and this continues to be a business with a lot of potential here domestically, as well as internationally. And of course we like the business, in particular, because its margin profile is accretive to the company and it's the poster child of what we mean when we say we're interested in good growth that's profitable and responsible and sustainable.","Operator","Next question comes from Joe Altobello of Raymond James.","Joe Altobello","So first on Nutranext and the upside you saw this quarter. It sounds like a lot of that was distribution gains. Was there any greater same store sales as well?","Benno Dorer","It's hard to break it down, right now. So I would -- obviously we feel good about Nutranext, Joe, and integration continues to be on track, we are seeing slightly improved trends. But somewhere it also is rounding right, so we\u2019re rounding up now, because the trends are slightly stronger, whereas previously we had to round down. I would call it on track for the fiscal year and perhaps slightly ahead versus where we were in our November call, and that is driven by really robust performance of several of the strategic brands in Nutranext. But we are seeing as we've noted and you've certainly picked up distribution wins with key retailers in Food Drug Mass, also international.","And now in the back half, we're beginning to innovate on this business on various brands. So we feel good about where this business is. And think that we are in many really great emerging categories here where our company capabilities can make a difference and where consumers feel like the product are making a difference in their lives. And we stay focused on driving that. So I would call it on track to perhaps slightly ahead, but it's too early to call this a discontinuity in trend just yet.","Joe Altobello","And then secondly on charcoal, it's clear you guys are excited about charcoal. But I\u2019m curious how retailers think about the upcoming growing season in your merchandizing program. Are they as excited about your plans to increase alpha penetration? And so could we see a trade load, which seems like what you\u2019re expecting in Q3? Or are they relative there to last year or is it something in between? Thanks.","Benno Dorer","Again, we manage inventories pretty tightly. So clearly, retailers have an interest in a strong charcoal business. Why is that? First of all, it's a significant and meaningful business in itself. But also the baskets that the charcoal product is in for the shopper is usually a basket that is North of $100, because consumers by a lot of other things with charcoal that retailers are excited about, whether that\u2019s meat or whether that drinks or potato chips, you name it, so barbecues is a pretty nice shopping occasion. So retailers have interests and we're meeting with a lot of retailers to discuss the 2019 season now. We are getting a lot of support for our plans. So I expect weather permitting 2019 to be a robust grilling season for Kingsford.","Operator","Your last question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","I was hoping you could just talk a little bit about litter, because numbers you discussed and some of this business is doing really, really well its quite different in track channels. So I was curious if you could just share with us, one, what you are seeing in terms of competitive pricing activity if you've been -- I think you're a leader there as well. So if you've been followed, how rational the category. Is it a total category look? And then also where some of this stronger performance, is it in club, is it e-commerce? So just curious the channels that are driving this performance?","Benno Dorer","So obviously another good quarter by Litter, and pricing certainly executed with excellent, that was the first business that went out with pricing in last summer. We have started to see competition follow, not all competition. But again, I don't think we're done playing this out just yet. This usually takes six to 12 months, so we'll have to see what happens. But in general, we're pleased to see competition follow in that everybody else is seeing the same cost increases too, key drivers behind the performance continues to be innovation. Clean Paws continues to do very well for us. And it's really broad-based, I would say and clearly non-track channels are doing better than track channels, but within that it is broad-based. It\u2019s a business that starts to really well. In e-com also it's one of our faster growing e-commerce businesses that really across the board just signaling the strength of the brand and the strong support that we have by retailers behind Fresh Step, in particular.","Lauren Lieberman","Is there a major margin differential for e-commerce versus brick and mortar for litter, because the shipping cost would be probably a bit onerous?","Benno Dorer","No, it's about the same, Lauren, as is true for the rest of our portfolio as well. There is no significant margin difference. Again, emphasizing our focus on good growth and profitable growth, so growing e-commerce is a terrific opportunity. Also, because litter is one of the product categories that is really conducive to being purchased on autopilots, because you use it the same way every single day, so this is one where overtime we think that there's an opportunity to build a really efficient business once you hopefully able to lock more and more consumers into automatic repurchases and reordering that can be particularly effective down the road.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Dorer, I would now like to turn the program back over to you.","Benno Dorer","Yes. Thank you all for joining us today. And I look forward to speaking with you in May when we share our third quarter results. Have a good day all.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"5200":["The Clorox Co.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","And I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Lisah Burhan, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Lisah, you may begin your conference.","Lisah Burhan - The Clorox Company","Thank you, Vickie, and welcome, everyone. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, our Chairman and CEO; and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet, and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com.","On today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including, but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA, and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enable investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations.","Reconciliations with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available on our website as well as in our SEC filings. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release.","Please also recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly, as it relates to the impact of tax legislation.","Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcome to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.","With that, I'll turn to our top-line commentary. I'll discuss highlights in each of our segments. Kevin will then address our financial results as well as our outlook for FY 2019. Finally, Benno will offer his perspective and we will close with Q&A.","For the total company, Q4 sales grew 3% and full year sales also grew 3% with growth in three of our four segments. I will now go through our results by segment.","In our Cleaning segment, Q4 sales grew 3% and full year sales also grew 3% on top of strong 5% growth in prior fiscal year. Cleaning segment growth was driven by the continued strong momentum in our largest business unit, Home Care, which saw high single-digit sales growth in both Q4 and full year as well as share growth for the fourth consecutive year.","Within Home Care, Clorox Disinfecting Wipes grew sales double-digits in Q4 following our price increase demonstrating the strength of our equity. Pass-through of our November 2017 price increase and competitive reactions are all generally in line with our expectations. Also contributing to Home Care's growth this quarter was the expansion of our successful Clorox Scentiva line into new bath aerosol and toilet cleaning products. The Scentiva innovation platform continues to be well received by consumers.","In our Laundry business, sales were about flat for the quarter and the year. We continue to shift the mix of this business to the premium segment, and are pleased to see Clorox's liquid bleach grew share for the quarter and for the year. In May, we launched new powerful bleach advertising, which inspires consumers to use bleach by focusing on unique moments showcasing bleach as the solution.","Lastly, within the Cleaning segment, our Professional Products sales declined for the quarter and for the year due to the Aplicare divestiture, which we will lap during this month of August. Excluding the impact of Aplicare, sales grew strongly for the quarter and for the year following price increases on about a third of the portfolio.","Looking ahead to FY 2019, we are in the process of executing additional pricing actions across another significant portion of the portfolio. Before moving off discussion on this business, I want to mention that one of the areas we're especially pleased with and that's the strength and potential of the Total Clorox 360 System innovations which we introduced in late March 2017. This system uses an electrostatic technology, allowing disinfectants to reach even the hardest to reach areas in the facilities. Market response to Total 360 has been very positive with more than 25 professional sports team having adopted it for their athletic facilities as well as hundreds of schools and other commercial facilities.","Turning to the Household segment, Q4 sales decreased 3% on top of 4% growth in the year ago quarter. On a full year basis, Household segment sales came in flat on top of strong 5% growth in FY 2017. Sales decline in Household was largely driven by Charcoal. Q4 sales were down, driven in part by cold weather earlier in the quarter as well as lower merchandising levels at several retailers. Full year sales also declined. For perspective, Q4 is our largest quarter in this business and in combination with Q3 makes up more than two-thirds of the year sales.","Looking ahead, we're focused on continuing to extend the grilling season in partnership with Major League Baseball as well as partnering with retailers to optimize merchandising strategies to grow the category and attract new users along with expanding our premium tier of products.","In our Cat Litter business, Q4 sales grew double-digits on top of double-digit year ago sales growth, driven by core strength and our new Clean Paws innovation. Clean Paws has been one of our biggest litter launch out of the gate, and continues to perform very well. The Cat Litter business continues to have strong momentum as reflected in seven consecutive quarters of market share growth as well as high-single-digit sales growth for the year. As you may remember, during our May earnings call, we announced the price increase on this business effective July 1. We're pleased to report that pass-through is on track and higher prices are already reflected at shelf at several major retailers including the largest retailer.","In our Glad bags and wraps business, Q4 sales declined slightly, but were about flat for the year. This is mainly driven by lower sales of food bags and wraps as well as the strategic price pullback we implemented on a portion of our trash bags business earlier this fiscal year. Importantly, we continue to grow sales strongly in our premium trash segment behind a continued stream of innovation on our OdorShield scented trash bag platform, as well as capitalizing on new patented dual layer technology.","Our new ForceFlex Plus Advanced Protection trash bags introduced earlier in the year are performing well in market. In FY 2019, we will complete our conversion to this new dual layer form of trash bags which is now part of our overall strategy to deliver patent protected consumer preferred products that use less resin.","Finally, turning to RenewLife, sales decreased this quarter partly as we make changes to our supply chain to address the challenges we discussed with you last quarter. We're midway through this changes which we expect to complete this fall and customer service levels are currently tracking back at targeted levels. Q4 sales were also impacted by higher trade spending to support several trial building programs. Sales were about flat for the year, reflecting strong growth in the first half offset by declines in the back half of the fiscal year due to the challenges I just discussed.","Looking ahead, we expect to return to sales growth as we continue to build distribution on our new organic line, expand distribution of our core products and further increase our e-commerce presence.","In our Lifestyle segment, Q4 sales increased 21%, reflecting gains from the Nutranext acquisition. And on a full year basis, sales increased 8%, largely reflecting the benefit of Nutranext. Brita sales grew for the quarter, reflecting lower trade spending and strong e-commerce growth. Sales for the full year were up slightly, reflecting the continued success of our Stream Pitcher innovation and Brita Stream continues to be the number one selling pitcher on Amazon.","Burt's Bees sales grew for the quarter and for the year. We're especially pleased at the health of our core Burt's Bees business with our lip balm assuming the number one market share position for the last quarter in the total lip balm category for the first time, contributing to a record quarter in shipments for lip care.","In the meantime, our cosmetics launch continues to perform well in market and the liquid lipsticks are now shipping and available in select stores. This form of lipstick makes up about 20% of lipstick category today and it's growing at a very strong double-digits rate.","Wrapping up the Lifestyle segment, food sales declined for the quarter but increased for the year. Q4 results reflect timing of merchandising at a large retailer. At the same time, we're pleased that our total Hidden Valley equity grew share for the 14th consecutive quarter. In particular, our dry dressing business grew behind our focus on extending use as a seasoning and recipe ingredient.","Finally, turning to International, Q4 sales decreased 2% mainly reflecting unfavorable FX headwinds primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine peso which more than offsets the benefit of price increases. On a full year basis, International sales grew 2% despite FX headwinds of about two points. We continue to focus on our Go Lean strategy to drive margin improvement while selectively investing in margin accretive portions of our International portfolio that have tailwinds. We're pleased to see the areas we're investing in growing both in absolute and as a percent of our International business such as Burt's Bees, which reported double-digit growth again this quarter.","Now, I'll turn it over to Kevin, who'll discuss our Q4 and fiscal year performance as well as outlook for FY 2019.","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Thank you, Lisah. We're pleased with our fourth quarter and fiscal year results. We continue to make solid progress in a challenging environment, delivering strong sales and earnings growth, while continuing to generate healthy cash flow.","Turning to our financial results for the fourth quarter, Q4 sales grew 3% driven by three points of benefit from Nutranext acquisition, partially offset by about one point of unfavorable foreign currency, largely driven by the recent devaluation of the Argentine peso and nearly one point of negative impact of the Aplicare sale.","Fourth quarter sales also reflect volume growth supported by innovation as well as one point of pricing benefit which was offset by about one point of unfavorable mix. Gross margin for the quarter came in as expected at 44%, a decrease of 170 basis points compared to 46% in the year ago quarter. Fourth quarter gross margin included about 130 basis points of unfavorable commodities and about 100 basis points of logistics costs, partially offset by the benefits of 120 basis points of cost savings and 50 basis points of pricing.","As previously communicated, fourth quarter gross margin also included about 60 basis points from charges related to the Nutranext acquisition. Selling, administrative expenses increased about 0.5 to 13.5% of sales, largely driven by cost related to the Nutranext acquisition, partially offset by lower employee incentive compensation costs and progress from our ongoing productivity initiatives.","Advertising and sales promotion investment levels for the quarter came in at about 9% of sales. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate came in at 28.7% versus 31.7% in the year ago quarter, largely reflecting the benefits from U.S. tax reform. Net of all these factors, we delivered diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.66, an increase of 8%.","Now, I'll turn to our results for the full fiscal year. Sales grew 3%, which included about three points of growth from innovation and about one point of benefit from the Nutranext acquisition, partially offset by about one point of negative impact from the Aplicare divestiture. Gross margin for the fiscal year came in as expected, down 100 basis points at 43.7% compared to 44.7% in fiscal year 2017. Fiscal year gross margin results included 130 basis points of higher commodity costs and 90 basis points of logistics pressure, partially offset by 140 basis points of cost savings and 40 basis points from pricing.","We're proud of our strong track record of delivering annual cost savings of more than $100 million, which we achieved for the 11th consecutive year in fiscal year 2018. Selling, administrative expenses for the full fiscal year came in at about 13.7% of sales essentially flat versus year ago.","Advertising and sales promotion as a percentage of sales for fiscal year 2018 came in at about 9% of sales with U.S. retail spending at slightly above 10% of sales. For the full fiscal year, our effective tax rate was 21.8% compared to the year ago rate of 31.9%, primarily reflecting the benefit of U.S. tax reform. Net of all these factors, our fiscal year diluted EPS from continuing operations was $6.26 compared with $5.35 in fiscal year 2017, an increase of 17%.","Turning to cash flow for the fiscal year, net cash provided by continuing operations in fiscal year 2018 came in at $974 million versus $871 million in the prior year, an increase of 12%. At the end of fiscal year 2018, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.9 times, slightly below our target range of 2 times to 2.5 times.","Now, I'll turn to our fiscal year 2019 outlook. We expect fiscal year sales to be in the range of 2% to 4%, reflecting about 3 points of growth from innovation, about 2.5 points of benefit from the net impact of the Nutranext acquisition and the Aplicare divestiture, and about 2 points of negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates, primarily driven by the recent devaluation in Argentina.","Turning to gross margin, we expect fiscal year gross margin to be about flat to up modestly, reflecting the benefits of pricing and a strong cost savings pipeline partially offset by the continuation of higher costs related to commodities and logistics. In the second quarter, we should start seeing the full benefits from our recently announced price increases and the comparison to the significant cost run-ups that started in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, leading to gross margin expansion in the back half of fiscal year 2019.","We expect fiscal year advertising and sales promotion spending to come in at about 10% of sales. As we mentioned in the press release, selling and administrative expenses are expected to come in at about 14% of sales, reflecting acquisition related investments and more normalized levels of performance based incentive compensation. We expect fiscal year EBIT margin to be about flat, reflecting increased investments in our brands and Nutranext related costs. Our outlook also includes the ongoing benefits of U.S. tax reform with the assumption that our fiscal year tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%, slightly higher than our fiscal year 2018 rate as we lap a number of one-time benefits in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 as a result of U.S. tax reform.","We expect free cash flow for fiscal year 2019 to come in at about 11% to 13% of sales, consistent with our recently updated long-term goal. Importantly, recognizing our strong track record of generating healthy cash flows and the strength of our balance sheet, we will continue to invest in the long-term health of our business and reward our shareholders.","As a reminder, in fiscal year 2018, we acquired the Nutranext business, further expanding our portfolio into health and wellness. We also increased our quarterly dividend by 14%, marking the 42nd consecutive year we have increased our dividend and we initiated a share repurchase program of up to $2 billion. And we currently plan to repurchase about half the full amount in fiscal year 2019.","Net of all these factors, fiscal year diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $6.32 to $6.52 which includes our previously communicated estimate of $0.08 to $0.12 of EPS dilution from the Nutranext acquisition. Fiscal year diluted EPS also includes about $0.05 to $0.07 of negative impact from the recently enacted tariffs which are affecting a couple of our business units. As we start our new fiscal year, I'd like to highlight a few areas we are aggressively managing.","First, we remain focused on executing our recently announced price increases in support of our efforts to drive profitable growth. We have a strong track record of taking pricing which is supported by our emphasis on delivering superior consumer value behind strong investments in innovation. To date, our pricing actions are progressing in line with our expectations. Next, we continue to anticipate elevated cost pressures from commodities particularly resin as well as the transportation market. And as I mentioned earlier, we expect these headwinds to be more pronounced in the first half of the fiscal year and to lap these significant cost run-ups that began in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018.","That said, we're operating in a volatile cost environment, which could impact the timing of our gross margin progress. While it's early, we assume gross margin expansion in the back half of fiscal year 2019.","And finally, we continue to face challenging economic conditions in International including the recent currency devaluation in Argentina. Consistent with our 2020 Strategy, we're addressing these challenges head-on with an eye on the long-term health of our business. We are increasing investments in our brands including innovation to support brand differentiation which will help us continue to deliver superior consumer value. We are leaning into our cost savings programs and productivity initiatives to address ongoing cost pressures. And finally continuing to execute our Go Lean strategy in International to partially mitigate the more challenging currency environment we're expecting. In closing, we're pleased with our solid results in fiscal year 2018.","We will continue to drive our 2020 Strategy with an emphasis on creating superior consumer value which is enabling us to consistently deliver sales growth in an environment where growth is hard to come by. Importantly, we remain confident in our ability to deliver long-term shareholder value.","And with that, I will turn it over to Benno.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Hi, everyone. And thanks, Kevin. I'll now offer my perspective. First, we delivered another solid year advancing our 2020 Strategy while remaining agile and aggressive in our approach to mitigate significant cost headwinds.","We grew sales for the year 3% including another strong year of innovation at about 3% of incremental sales, and about a point from the acquisition from Nutranext partially offset by nearly a point of negative impact from the Aplicare divestiture. We feel very good about these results in an environment where growth is very hard to achieve. We are particularly pleased that all major innovations are doing well in markets including Fresh Step Clean Paws, the Clorox Scentiva platform, Burt's Bees cosmetics, Glad trash innovations and our Professional Products Clorox Total 360 System.","And while our focus on traditional retailers remains most important, we continue to make strong progress in e-commerce and sales in these channels are estimated to be up more than 40% for the fiscal year. We achieved these results while operating through a volatile cost environment that was significantly worse than anticipated, taken an agile and aggressive approach to mitigate the impact by leaning into cost savings and moving quickly and decisively to announce cost justified price increases.","To put this in perspective, we now plan to take price increases on about 50% of our portfolio in fiscal year 2019. We delivered 17% diluted EPS growth for the fiscal year and we put our healthy balance sheet and strong cash flow to work investing in the health of the company, creating a new runway for growth with the Nutranext acquisition and returning cash to shareholders by increasing the dividend by 14% in May 2018 and by entering the market with up to a $2 billion share repurchase program.","Second, for fiscal year 2019, we're projecting another year of solid sales growth, as we increase investments to support the business and drive profitable growth in our core and our recent acquisitions. Sales growth will be supported by increased investments in advertising and sales promotion with a focus on digital marketing and innovation. We'll also continue to execute our pricing plans consistent with our focus on driving profitable growth and category growth for our retailers. We continue to have a robust margin accretive innovation plan on many of our brands including Burt's Bees, Fresh Step, Glad trash and Hidden Valley as well as continued investments to support our successful fiscal year 2018 innovations.","We remain confident in the long-term outlook for the RenewLife digestive health business and we continue to anticipate about three points of growth from the newest member of our portfolio, the Nutranext vitamins and dietary supplement business where integration is progressing in line with expectations. And from a channel perspective, including Nutranext, e-commerce is now estimated at 6% of company sales and we anticipate growing strongly in this channel again in fiscal year 2019 to an estimated 8% of company sales.","Third, as we decisively address near-term pressures, we will not be deterred from our 2020 Strategy and focus on profitable, sustainable and responsible growth to create long-term shareholder value. We continue to take a long-term view and remain confident in our strategy. We are continuing to invest for the future not only through increased brand building investments but also in technology transformation such as with technology enabled consumer engagement and capital investments to enhance our supply chain and support long-term growth through technology.","All our major brands are seen as superior by consumers versus their competitive brands. And while we have work to do on some of them, I feel good about the health of our portfolio overall and the plans we have in place to support them and we will maintain our emphasis on driving superior value through a combination of product performance, price and consumer perception. We'll continue to lean into the more profitable parts of our portfolio and focus on expanding the core behind health and wellness with Nutranext and RenewLife as the engines. We'll double down on our focus to restore gross margin growth as we aim to extend our track record of delivering 11 consecutive years of cost savings at $100 million or more.","And we will support these efforts by continuing to build a more agile enterprise with highly engaged employees who are keenly focused on growing our business the right way. So, in a difficult cost environment, we continue to have confidence in our 2020 Strategy, as the means to create long-term value for shareholders.","Operator, you many now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Dorer. And we will take our first question today from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hello, everyone. I had a question on your advertising expense. First, it was down a lot in Q4, so hoping you could help us better understand why that was. And then your guidance for organic sales growth in FY 2019 is consistent with what you generated last year despite your expectations for step-up advertising since you're expecting it to go to 10% of sales from 9.3% last year. So I guess I'm wondering if you're finding that you need to spend more to get the same level of growth. Thanks.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Bonnie. First on Q4, we'll remind everybody that we have always said that there's going to be quarterly variance. We don't manage the business by quarter. We don't manage the spend by quarter. We're focusing on the long-term, and there is a reason why our guidance is on an annual basis.","What I will say on Q4 is that part of it certainly was Charcoal which became clear throughout the quarter was going to be significantly lower in sales, negatively impacting the company by about one point, because of the inventory hangover we had from Q3, which, as you know, was really soft behind the unusually cold weather. And that continued in April which led to lower merchandising throughout the quarter. And we certainly thought that there is no need to spend into that headwind as much as we did last year.","What I will tell you though is that for fiscal year 2019, as you noted, we're committed to be about 10% level which is in line with our target. So there's no news here. We're staying the course managing the business for the long-term. And as you related to the sales guidance, what I would ask you is certainly to keep in mind that what we have communicated is that as we take pricing, it typically takes a few quarters for consumers to get used to new price points.","We've also commented on the fact that there might be temporarily bumpiness as it relates to merchandising, as we're working through this with retailers. And all of that is reflected in what we think is a really balanced outlook that reflects the upside and the risks that we see in the fiscal year pretty appropriately. So, fiscal year 2019, it's going to be back to 10%.","We'll invest in innovation. That is going to contribute another 3% in line with our targets. And we'll also continue to shift our spend towards digital, which as we've noted in the past, accounted for about 50% of our advertising sales promotion spend in fiscal year 2018, and is expected to contribute about 55% to 60% of our total spend in fiscal year 2019, all based on the strong ROIs that we have.","So, 10% is the right level now and ongoing. And the 2% to 4% sales guidance that we have given for the fiscal year appropriately reflects what we're seeing in the marketplace, and certainly also reflects the fact that it's early in the year and the environment is somewhat volatile.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Right. Thank you.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Thanks, Bonnie.","Operator","And the next question will come from Wendy Nicholson with Citi.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. First question is on Glad pricing, which I know it made a ton of sense on \u2013 whatever I guess nine months ago to roll back that pricing because of the competitive positioning and the competitive activity in the category.","But obviously on \u2013 the input environment has changed dramatically. So, how are you thinking about Glad pricing now? Is there a hope for more positive pricing? When do we lap that? Maybe a little bit more discussion about that. Thanks.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. Thank you, Wendy. So, what we did, as noted in the past was take a price cut on about 40% of the Glad trash pricing last fall just set the table as we anticipated strong innovation in the back half of last fiscal year and get that value right.","As I think is evident in the really strong progress in volume and sales on that business that's achieved its objectives. And we're pleased with the success of the innovation out of the gate. I'm also today announcing that we will take pricing on Glad trash.","And I think that should tell you two things: first of all, that we believe in the value of the brand and the products that we offer on Glad as is evidenced by the continued shift towards the more profitable premium end of the business, which now accounts for north of two-third of the entire portfolio in trash.","But the second thing that tells you also is that our pricing efforts overall are going in line with plan as is perhaps evidenced by the first business that we announced pricing on in the last quarter, which is Cat Litter which was first out of the gate.","And as Lisah mentioned earlier, the higher prices are now visible at shelf at several major retailers, including our largest retailer. So, Glad will take pricing as well bringing the total percentage of our portfolio that we will take pricing on to 50% globally.","And that, of course, also includes more of the professional business where we took about a-third pricing on about a-third of the business in the last fiscal year and we're now adding another about 40 percentage points bringing the total amount of the PPD business where we're taking pricing to about 75%.","So, strong cost justified case on pricing, our brands continue to offer superior value and we don't expect that to be affected by these price increases. This is a strategic case of allowing us to keep investing in innovation and advertising sales promotion to grow categories. And we'll do a lot of that in fiscal year 2019 and it's all going in line with plan.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","That's hugely helpful. And can I ask one follow-up kind of just higher level? Clorox is one of the first companies obviously in the group to start raising prices, given the commodity environment.","And I'm just wondering, if generally \u2013 I know you said that the response competitively and from retailers is kind of as expected. Did you notice any difference in terms of your price increases going through online versus offline or in traditional channels?","This is the first time online benefit factor and you guys have been historically very strong online. So, is there any nuance in terms of hey, given the retail environment has changed, we need to think about pricing or the time it takes effect or the competitive response anything like that in a different light?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","So, no two companies are the same, so I can't speak for the industry. But for our company there's no difference.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. Perfect. Thanks so much.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Thanks, Wendy.","Operator","And we'll go to Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank.","Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. So, to build on what you just said \u2013 I agree you've been at the forefront of the industry's effort to drive prices these past several months and you seem pretty determined to carry that forward into 2019.","I was just hoping you could maybe step back and provide a few more details on what your experience has been thus far and any color as you look forward on what percentage of list price increases you expect to really show up in the market as an incremental pricing net of kind of promotional offsets and whether you expect that incrementality to differ materially across different product categories as you push for list price.","So, I'm just curious. I have no doubt you're going to push the list prices through. I'm just \u2013 my question is really about how much of that will drive true incrementality to the fiscal 2019 P&L? Thanks.","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Yes. Thanks, Steve. So, can't comment on individual percentages because those vary by category and because we're still talking to retailers. But two things perhaps are helpful.","First of all, the increases that we're seeing on Cat Litter are precisely in line with our plans. And then perhaps to your broader point, we are not planning to spend any of those price increase dollars back in trade and we also did not do that in fiscal year 2018. So, our expectation is that the pass-through, while pricing certainly is at the discretion of retailers, will be in line with our plans.","Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Okay. And then, if I could on guidance. Back of the envelope math, but just given what you said about SG&A and A&P each moving higher, the 2019 outlook really seems dependent on pretty reasonable gross margin improvement, as I look at it, if you think it's a midpoint of your guidance and\/or a pretty frontend loaded buyback financed on favorable terms.","So maybe, Kevin or Benno, just react to my back of the envelope conclusions? And then in that context, just talk a little bit more about your confidence in seeing true gross margin expansion next year versus gross margins just kind of leveling off? And then, any details you could provide on how you plan to finance and timing the buyback would be great? Thank you.","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Yes, Steve, this is Kevin. I can try to answer some of those questions. So, as it relates to gross margin, clearly, I would say, a couple of things. First, the work we're doing on cost savings I'm very pleased with. We have one of the most robust cost savings pipeline planned for 2019 that I've seen in quite a while. And that's obviously what we attack first to offset the commodity environment we're seeing.","Additionally, as Benno talked about with our pricing actions on about half the portfolio, that's the other piece of the model that will allow us to be flat to up modestly. We control those two elements and we feel very comfortable about the work we're doing. What is not directly in our control is the commodity environment and the transportation environment.","We certainly expect to see inflation continue in fiscal year 2019. I would say, as it relates to commodities, our expectation is the inflation rate will be fairly similar to what we saw in 2018. And as it relates to transportation, my expectation is while we'll see inflation in 2019, it won't be to the same degree that we saw in 2018, so moderating a bit.","And so overall, our belief is that we will be flat to up. I think what's also important though is to think about the phasing, what I really expect in the front half of the year, we really haven't lapped the significant upcharges we saw in fiscal year 2018. So, I would expect the front half of the year to look more in line with what we're seeing in the back half of fiscal year 2018.","But by the back half of 2019, we'll see the benefits of cost savings. We'll see the benefits of pricing playing through our P&L. And that's really where I expect to see sequential improvement throughout the year with gross margin expansion in the back half of the year.","And then your other question was related to share buybacks. I would tell you, I won't provide a quarterly outlook on the phasing, but we are planning currently to exercise about half of our authorized amount of $1 billion, and we'll do that based on criteria we've set internally over the course of the year.","Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Steve.","Operator","And next is Steve Strycula with UBS.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. Two part question. The first part would be, can you give us some color between the volume and the price mix on an organic basis for, I think you've answered it already, but for the fourth quarter and how we should think about it for the full-year and how it might have broken out by segment. You've done that historically. We just kind of want a little bit of a better feel as to how the underlying businesses are doing on a volume ex acquisition and price basis? Thank you.","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Hi, Steve. This is Kevin. I'll speak to the fourth quarter and full-year for 2019. In the fourth quarter, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we saw about 3% growth from Nutranext. We had volume growth on the base business, and then the headwinds we saw where FX was about 1 point headwind as well as the Aplicare divestiture keep that in mind was about 1 point as well. And then pricing was 1 point benefit, offset by unfavorable mix in assortment.","As I look forward to fiscal year 2019, our expectations are as we mentioned innovation will drive about 3 points of growth, the net impact of the Nutranext acquisition and Aplicare divestiture will be about a 2.5 point benefit.","And then we are looking at fairly significant devaluation in International, about a 2 point headwind, primarily related to the Argentine peso devaluation we experienced in May and June.","As it relates to pricing, expectation right now is pricing will have limited benefit on the sales line. You'll have the benefit of more revenue per case, but that will be offset by the elasticities on volume, as consumers adjust to the new pricing.","And so, what I expect to see in fiscal year 2019 is our volume growing more in line with sales. Typically, our volume tends to grow a little bit faster than sales, but I think in 2019 you'll see those growing more in line.","Lisah Burhan - The Clorox Company","Is there anything else, Steve?","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. I didn't realize I was getting second question, but I'll take it. So, the second piece would be, Benno, if we went to the midpoint of your organic sales guidance for the full-year and we just thought about the different moving pieces with pricing coming through, what really drives the sensitivity from the low-end versus the high-end? And can things really go your way versus things not going your way? What would be the one or two variables that you would think are most in flux as we think about the balance of the year? Thank you.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. I mean look, there's a number of things. So, I'd say, we'd certainly point to FX as one, right, that's a 2 point drag. And obviously, that's very much driven by the Argentine peso, but FX continues to be a headwind. So, I would point to that.","And then I would certainly point to the success with the consumer around pricing as the second one, right? So clearly, as I pointed out, so far it's going in line with our expectations.","The good news about that is that historically we've been able to model the impact of pricing on volume with the consumer extremely precisely. And what I mean by that is within plus\/minus 2% variance.","So, our modeling historically has always been good, but pricing on 50% of the portfolio is a significant undertaking. And hence the 2 point range coupled with the FX uncertainty seems very appropriate, but I would point to those two things.","Operator","And we'll now go to Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. So, I want to follow-up on a couple of questions. One is back to the EBIT being flat, so gross margin is flat to up modestly, which were the words you used. The S&A is going to go to about 14%, which is 40 basis points.","The A&P goes up by about 70 basis points to roughly 10%. How do you get to flat EBIT margins? Unless R&D is coming down a lot or modestly means not modestly in terms of gross margin? Or is there something else going on that I don't understand?","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. Ali, this is Kevin. What I would say is, obviously, it's still very early in the year, so these are the outlook we provided are ranges around each of those estimates. We'll have to see how the commodity environment plays out. We certainly provided a range around gross margin accretion and we'll have to see where that plays out as well as our admin spending.","We said about 14%. Part of that is driven by the Nutranext acquisition and the integration spending we're doing as we're integrating our people, process and systems. And so, I would take those as ranges and we'll have to see how that plays out and we'll clearly update you folks as we move through the year.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So, just to build on that, because clearly gross margin is a little bit of a \u2013 I mean, there wasn't a number given, there's a lot of moving parts obviously, as Benno said, a huge undertaking to take price on 50% of your business. And I think, you said \u2013 I think maybe it was you Kevin just a second ago that you expect volume to be roughly in line with sales for 2019.","And if that's right, how does that jive with taking pricing on 50% of your portfolio? Does it go back to the question of \u2013 for now you're going to promote a lot of it back, so we're not actually going to see the pricing, it's going to be a lot of promo spend initially to rash it down?","Or is there something else going on? And again, I say that in the context of, I'm trying to put your guidance together here, it's just not working for me.","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. I can speak to the trade spending, as Benno just mentioned, our plans are not to increase trade spending.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","But so how is sales in line with volume?","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Well here's what I'd say, typically when you have high FX like we're projecting for 2019, you'll see volume growing faster than sales and if you look back at our history that's been very true.","This year, in spite of the high FX, you have a dampening effect on volume based on elasticity in the near-term and so that's why you'll see volume and sales growing more in line.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. And perhaps, Ali, if I may add, so if you think about Q4, for instance, so at 5% volume growth leading to 3% total sales growth which included 1% negative impact from FX.","If you look at the fiscal year 2019 guidance, you see 3% volume growth. And if you take out FX that's \u2013 at the midpoint would be 5% of sales. So, I do think, once you take FX into account you start seeing the difference.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. Okay. And then just on another point, you mentioned, you're taking on the International challenges head on, I think, was the word you used. Can you mention a little bit more kind of leaning out of that business. Are there things more dramatic that you could do to that business?","It's clearly been a disappointment, sometimes there's progress, sometimes there's not. Oftentimes it is not the fault of that business unit, given the FX changes et cetera now in Argentina. Do you still think that fits in the portfolio? Are there other things you could do to that business that are more dramatic?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","You know, perhaps I'll give you the broader context and Kevin will add some perspective on Argentina. So, if we think about the International business as a whole, we have as many number one brands in International as we have in the U.S.","We have solid plans to offset the cost inflation and we've done that well operationally. We're performing very well as is evidenced by fiscal year 2018 where for the second year in a row we've shown sales and profit growth. So, it's not where we wanted to be, but given the FX headwinds actually performing quite well.","So, we're optimistic about that business which is why we're investing into it. But what we've talked about is that we're shifting our investment stance to the more profitable parts of the portfolio. We have four growth vectors in International business and they now account for 30% of our portfolio. And that's up significantly from previous years.","So, we're shifting the category country mix quite attractively towards parts of the portfolio that aren't just margin accretive to the International business, but margin accretive to the company. The setback right now and the foot on the brake is Argentina and I'll let perhaps Kevin comment on the specific things we're doing in Argentina.","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Sure. Yeah, Ali as it relates to Argentina, as we've talked about the two point headwind from FX that's primarily driven by Argentina. And as I mentioned in my opening comments, we've seen a 30% devaluation in the Argentine peso in the month of May and June. So you can imagine, we'll have to lap that over the first 10 months of this year.","Additionally, our belief is we'll continue to see the peso depreciate versus the dollar marginally over the balance of the year, in addition to what's already occurred in May and June. And so, it's certainly a challenging environment in Argentina.","What I would say, though is, we've operated in Argentina for quite a while over 30 years and we have a very experienced team who is very knowledgeable about operating this environment. And so, the team knows exactly what to do in a highly inflationary environment. We're very much focused on protecting profit. There's less you can do about the top-line, but certainly our focus are on protecting profit. And I think the team has developed some nice plans for 2019 to do just that, in spite of the challenging currency environment.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks so much, guys.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Sure. Thanks, Ali.","Operator","And we'll go to Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you. Wanted to talk a little bit about mix. Because obviously, this quarter, the mix was negative in all the division. So trying to understand first what's \u2013 we have embedded in terms of the impact of mix next year? And what are the key things that are driving that down this year? And does that improve over time?","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. Hi, Olivia. This is Kevin. I can take that one and speak a little bit about mix. Little bit different drivers for each of our segments. If you think about the Cleaning segment, we continue to have very strong club performance. And as you know, with the larger size there's a little bit of negative mix there when you're growing significantly in club.","In Household, as Benno mentioned, we've had a weaker Charcoal business this year. Charcoal is very profitable and high revenue business for us, so that's created some unfavorable mix in Household.","And then Lifestyle is a bit interesting. Nutranext has a lower revenue per case for us, but its margin accretive to the company. So while it's a little bit of negative mix of the top-line, we're very happy to have that negative mix in Lifestyle segment, as it relates to Nutranext. And so, we've got a few different drivers.","As I look forward, clearly Charcoal is not something we expect to see continuing on, in fiscal year 2019, but I would expect to see some of that in the Nutranext, our Lifestyle segment, given the mix of that business.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And then on the price increase, it's great to see that 50% of the portfolio is being helped by that. But, I have to ask what's going on in the other 50%? Perhaps a portion of that just doesn't need pricing, but how much of that are areas where you just wouldn't be comfortable pricing, because of the competitive positioning or market dynamics?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Well, keep in mind that the 50% is our new price increases. What's not included there is the PPD portfolio that we took pricing on in fiscal year 2018 and also CDW and that takes you to about 70% of the total portfolio. And I think that, on pricing our glass is more than have full, and I'd love to focus on the 70% that we're taking pricing.","I'd also say that pricing continues to be something that we'll review constantly on all the businesses and that's up to the general managers to make the right decisions as far as whether to take pricing or not and when to take pricing.","And we certainly, as we contemplate pricing moves keep cost justification in mind very strongly. We want to make sure that we are on solid ground there. And we keep the value proposition that we offer to consumers in mind as well.","We have talked for several years now about our deep commitments to offering products and brands that offer superior value to consumers. And in the face of pricing, that's when that commitment to value is being tested. And what I can tell you is that that commitment is as strong after the price increases as it is before the price increases.","And with help from strong brand investments, with help from innovation, and marketing plans that engage consumers. We're confident that The Clorox Company's brands will continue to offer better value to consumers, no matter whether we take pricing on 70% of the portfolio or not at this point on 30% of the portfolio.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Fair enough. And if I could just ask one last thing on \u2013 just a quick one on manufacturing logistics, do you think the worst is over because that was a nice sort of lifting of the pressure relative to \u2013 in Q4 relative to Q3?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah, Olivia. What I would say is certainly on transportation, we think we saw the high watermark in fiscal 2018. While I do think it's still an inflationary environment, I don't expect to see the type of rate increases we saw in 2018. I would expect transportation in the mid to high-single-digit rate increases. And last year, we're experiencing high-double-digit increases.","And so, I think we've done some nice things to get to a lower level of inflation on transportation. And then our manufacturing as well, manufacturers \u2013 manufacturing expense can move around by quarter as we invest in our supply chain, but I'd expect a similar amount on an annual basis what we saw in 2018.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Thanks, Olivia.","Operator","Next is Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good morning. Thanks very much. Two questions. First, where \u2013 both in terms of where you are now and what you're expecting for 2019, can you give us an update on the Burt's Bees cosmetics rollout, where you are in distribution, kind of growth rate? It may be at least characterized how that is relative to your expectations, and how it's contributing, and how that paces over 2019?","And secondly, I wanted to follow-up. I'll probably ask this question five ways in my career. Maybe I'll get it right this time. But, a comment that Kevin made about the pacing of cost savings plans caught my ear. I guess I'm just kind of wondering like how \u2013 you have a great pipeline you mentioned.","I'm wondering like is that pipeline discretionary at this point, where you feel like you have more like you kind of pace that out to kind of manage any kind of inflationary pressure you might see in the future? Or is it the case that you're pushing as hard as you can and there are some real kind of mechanical business factors that prevent you from getting all that cost savings all at once? Thank you.","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Yeah, Jonathan. This is Kevin. I'll take the cost savings. And I'll let Benno talk about the Burt's Bees question. As it relates to cost savings, what I can tell you is I'm very pleased with the program we have in place for fiscal year 2019.","In fact, it's one of the strongest cost savings pipeline I've seen over the last several years. And that's really needed, as we're facing a fairly challenging commodity environment. We are leaning into cost savings. That's both a combination of all the good work we do within the supply chain and also part of our admin productivity initiatives. And so, we have a long track record of delivering cost savings. We are absolutely leaning in this year to offset the headwinds and I'm very pleased with the progress we're making for the year. Benno, you want to talk to Burt's Bees?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. For a moment I thought you'll take the Burt's Bees question, it would have been entertaining. The cosmetics launch is performing well. As Lisah has noted earlier, this is a launch that's building over multiple quarters, which is driven by two things. First of all, retailer shelf presets timings, but also our commitments to be disciplined in this, we don't want to get hung up in some of the industry dynamics in cosmetics.","We want to make sure that we're disciplined and that we're driving this based on solid SKU velocities and with the right amount of SKUs and complexity, but one way perhaps how you can see that we're confident in this future platform is the launch of liquid lipsticks now, which we're really excited about, because it's a fast growing segment and one where we have a great product.","I feel good about the consumer receptivity and the reviews online, which you can see. So, we feel like we have a nice multiyear growth platform in cosmetics. We'll tell you though that as we've always said that the Burt's Bees discussion wouldn't be complete without us mentioning that it's only one growth runway.","The biggest and most important thing on Burt's Bees continues to be lip and face and those businesses continue to do extremely well. And as Lisah noted earlier in her remarks, we're particularly proud that for the first time in Q4 our lip balm as of 20-plus years in the market is now number one in the overall lip balm category. And that's a sizeable accomplishment, but it's still a pretty fragmented market. And we think that there is a lot more growth to be had there. And we've also commented on International as profitable and attractive growth platform growing double-digits in Q4.","So in Burt's Bees, I would want to make sure that we always keep in mind that we have multiple growth platforms and that we have confidence in all of them. With lip balm still continuing to be the biggest single opportunity we have in this business, which is why a substantial amount of the investments will still go again to lip balm.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thank you.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Thanks, Jonathan.","Operator","Next is Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thank you for let me ask questions. A few housekeeping items kind of run through quickly. You mentioned expectations for manufacturing logistics for next year. It's stepped down quite a bit, just in terms of magnitude and headwind in the fourth quarter. Anything notable changed there?","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","No, Jason. This is Kevin. I wouldn't identify anything notable. I think as we called out, we did have some investments in the supply chain back in Q2 for our new Home Care facility. So, it's a little bit elevated in Q2. But as I said, it can move from quarter-to-quarter based on timing of our investments.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. The volume growth for next year, the roughly 3%, how much is the M&A component in that? In other words, what's your organic volume expectation?","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","We don't provide that Jason, so I would stick to our overall growth rate that we provided, but we don't break it out that way.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. In terms of Charcoal sales, you're kind of attributing, I get the unfavorable weather early on. I have a harder time wrapping the head around, why category sales would be so weak on weaker merchandising. It doesn't seem to be such an expandable or contractable consumption category or impulse-oriented category to me. Help me understand that dynamic a little bit more. And can you give us little more context as to why retailers may have pulled back on the category, even after weather turned?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah, good point, Jason. So, actually it is expandable which is the whole premise of the category so, you see a display in store and makes you want to grill and you buy Charcoal. And while you do that you also buy a whole bunch of other things whether that's your beverage of choice or meat and chips and things that you want for a family afternoon. And that's why retailers have been and are so interested in supporting this category, and that's been the hallmark of our strategy to continue to provide more occasions for grilling and extend the season so that passionate grillers can spend more time grilling and we get more volume from those.","So, less merchandising in the category, right? So not just a brand, but in the category has led to category softness. And that's certainly something that's \u2013 if I categorize this for you and if I look at the quarter, the bulk of the volume softness was weather \u2013 yeah and the inventory hangover from Q3, which was also weather-related, so just to put it in perspective.","But the less merchandising contributed and that's because of the lower merchandising levels at several retailers. That's not something that's new. We see changes in retail or merchandising strategies every single year and sometimes they work like gangbusters and sometimes they work less well. And this certainly is a year where the changes have been less successful, which is why we're focused on three things.","First of all, the basic premise of extending the season and making sure that people have a chance to grill year round with the weather conditions in many parts of the country continues to be the right strategy for business like coal.","And since this season we've had a partnership with Major League Baseball in place around games and tailgating and online marketing that connects, if you will, America's favorite Charcoal with America's favorite pastime. And MLB baseball has its peak in October and we'd love for Charcoal grilling \u2013 for that to be true for Charcoal grilling as well.","We are working with retailers on the right merchandising strategies. Again that's not something that's new to us and something that we're very comfortable with. We need to get that right and do better for next season. And I think that's something that retailers understand. And obviously, there's a mutual benefit for that.","And then we're also focusing on millennials where we see an opportunity to educate them on grilling, because there's somewhat of a barrier. You don't want to look foolish, and you want to look like somebody who is knowledgeable grilling. And when you're just learning how to grill, there's a little bit of a barrier, and we're helping people through education mainly online to cross that barrier.","If I put that all in context, certainly coal needs to do better. Feel good about the rest of the portfolio as I mentioned in my earlier remarks. And I'd look at this perhaps as \u2013 while it's something I can't control because of weather, the continuation of what we saw in Litter, which two years ago was a real problem child, and is now, if not the best performing business, one of the best performing businesses for sure.","Last year's problem child was Brita and we're pleased to see that return to growth. And it looks like this season it's Charcoal. So feel good about the portfolio, even though it's not perfect. But to be honest, if everything was perfect we'd have nowhere to go. And I'd rather have a few clear action steps that we know how to address and coal is the one this year.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Very good. I've lots other questions but I'll pass it on for the sake of time. Thank you.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Thanks, Jason.","Operator","And we'll go to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just had a question about kind of retailer dynamics, right? So part of the big conversation across the industry, of course, has been retailer receptiveness to pricing, not just the consumer impact. And you guys have long talked about the idea that for companies that are innovating and driving growth if the retail relationship can be in a good spot as it has been for the last couple of years.","Anything that you can share now on how that may have evolved as the ask for pricing across the industry is getting a lot more broader, more companies asking for it even though that may be haven't been quite as innovative or driving as much category growth. Anything you can offer on that broad industry perspective in terms of retailers and the understanding of the price that needs to be showing up on shelf would be great.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Lauren. You could speak for Clorox perhaps more so than for the industry. Several things are important in order to do pricing effectively. The first thing is, as I've said earlier, it's got to be cost justified, right? So all our price increases are cost justified. And we're pretty transparent with retailers and truthful, of course, with retailers, because they see what we see in terms of cost.","The second thing that matters certainly is to have leading brands that offer better value for consumers. If you have that pricing discussions with retailers, which are never easy, because they want to make sure that you're doing the right thing.","But they are going to be more productive than in situations where you perhaps don't offer better value where you don't have leading brands and where your spot in the markets is less clearly defined. More than 80% of our portfolio are number one brands. The majority offer better value, so we're in a pretty good shape there.","Lastly though, I think retailers understand that not taking pricing simply isn't an option for a company like Clorox in this cost environment, and that there's a fundamental choice between either not taking pricing and then cutting spending and that leads to a downward spiral that I think is evident to all of us from some of the industries in our space. That's not going to lead to long-term success.","The alternative for Clorox and we think the only right alternative is to be able to continue to invest in your brands, to be able to continue to invest in innovation and to take pricing as a means to afford that.","And as we talk to retailers about our pricing plans we spend a large amount of time to also talk about our plans to grow their categories, our plans to have innovation in the categories that we take pricing in.","And I would certainly look at that as a big part of what makes pricing discussions with retailers productive.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. That's really helpful. And the last bit was just to be clear and I apologize if you feel like you've already answered this. But the pricing you've talked about the 50% of the portfolio in 2019 how much of that has been announced to the trade so just in terms of the absolute visibility with what's built into the outlook?","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Just to make sure, Lauren so your question is how much of the 50% has been announced to the trade?","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Just to make sure like \u2013 I mean I have no doubt that this pricing will show up on shelves as you've planned and intentioned, but I just wasn't sure how much is still like on the comp for you to discuss the specifics of retail partners versus your very good visibility on how that comes to shelf and when and so on vis-\u00e0-vis the outlook.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. So, internally we have very good visibility as to when that will be visible at shelf and we've commented on the fact that Litter was the one out first.","But in general, given that many of the discussions are still go on with retailers at this point I'd prefer not to comment on specifics on percentages, but we'll just have to let it play out in market and hope you can understand that, Lauren.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Of course. Okay. Thank you so much.","Operator","And next is Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, everyone.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Hey.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Thanks for fitting me in. Question, Benno on the sales growth guidance, so it seems to imply organic sales growth of about 2.5% at the midpoint excluding FX and acquisitions and divestitures relative to the company's 3% to 5% long-term target.","So understanding that the composition is going to be start to embed more price than we saw in fiscal 2018, can you talk about underlying category growth implied in the outlook? Any sort of market share and vision that's implied there and how that compares to fiscal 2018? And I guess I asked that in the context that Nielsen category growth weighting based on the \u2013 your product category suggests something sort of flattish at the moment.","And I'd make a couple points, number one Charcoal is probably at least 0.5 point drag. And I know the hope is if that's going to get better. And I also understand we're not capturing online and non-track including club.","But it would seem to imply perhaps an acceleration relative to what we saw in 2018. So any commentary there on the guide and market share outlook would be helpful. Thank you.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. So, I don't know that we reconcile it with that detail, Kevin, but in general, what we are seeing is that category dollars are pretty constant if you look at track channels, so we don't expect any change there.","We also continue to see faster growth in non-track channels and I wouldn't expect to see any change there. So in terms of categories they're pretty robust. And we expect that to continue. No change.","In terms of market shares \u2013 look it's our ambition to grow market shares right? It's one important metric for us. It's not the only important consumer metric to us. You've also heard us talk about our Consumer Value Measure and about household penetration as a really important metrics that we're doing well on.","What typically does happen in a year when you take pricing is that temporarily you will give a little bit on market shares. And that's as consumers are adjusting to price increases, that's also recognition of the fact that as was noted by some of the earlier, we've been out front on pricing.","And I think in all of our categories so there's a little bit of a time lag, perhaps if competitors follow until they follow and until that shows up in market, all of that will create some noise on market shares, but we're very committed to growing market shares in the long run.","I'd expect us to grow market shares. What that would look like over the next 12 months? We'll have to see. But \u2013 expect our categories to continue to do pretty well. We've historically not seen much change in categories post-price increases and we don't expect that to be the case this time either.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Okay, Benno. So, it sounds like implicitly your 2.5% underlying organic sales growth is relatively close to what you think the industry is going to do. Is that fair?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","I guess, I'd struggle saying yes or no, because I haven't done the math. I mean if you try to pinpoint to a blanket statement, I would say yes. But I would give that a qualifier. Is that okay?","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","That's good enough. Good luck. And thank you for the comments. I appreciate it.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Thanks, Kevin.","Lisah Burhan - The Clorox Company","We'll take one more question after this.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you for squeezing me in. Hello, everybody. So just a clarification on the volume and the mix effect for Nutranext. And if you do the math I mean obviously you gave us the components. But just, if you have to assume any mix effect for Nutranext going into next year like for this following fiscal year. And also related to that, in some ways, like I remember like RenewLife had a lot of distribution gains. How far are you from that? And if you kind of also embed Nutranext in that comment? Thank you.","Kevin Jacobsen - The Clorox Co.","Hi, Andrea, this is Kevin. I can certainly take your question on Nutranext mix. We don't provide mix at the SBU level. But what I'd tell you is what we saw in Q4 as it relates to Nutranext, I'd expect to see a consistent impact as we go forward. That business is still relatively small in the overall portfolio of Clorox. It won't be that material to the company.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. And on the distribution gains, like should we embed it in the 2% to 4%. And the 2.5% organic that we discussed just now? That is embedding some distribution gains for Lifestyle and for Digestive Health? Or not much?","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Obviously, one of the premises that we had when acquiring the Nutranext business was that through our strong sales capabilities we would be able to expand distribution. So that's very much the plan, Andrea.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you, Benno.","Operator","And this concludes our question-and-answer session. Mr. Dorer, I would now like to turn the program back to you.","Benno O. Dorer - The Clorox Co.","Yeah. Thank you, everyone, and hope you have a good rest of the day. And I look forward to speaking with you in November when we share our first quarter results. Thank you.","Operator","And thank you very much. That does conclude our conference for today.

You obviously read in the Tuesday press release, Larry has announced his retirement from the company. We're pleased Larry is staying on for the next 5 months to ensure a smooth transition of his responsibilities. However, this will be his last earnings call, it's something I know he deeply regrets.","For more than 3 decades, Larry has had a profound impact on the company, rising from the ranks of a summer intern in 1980, overseeing our --","[Audio Gap]","our business operations and core functions as Chief Operating Officer. He's had a significant hand, obviously, of the company's strategies and priorities and the results we\u2019ve driven. He's been certainly a great partner to me over last 6 years. And -- but Larry\u2019s not one to enjoy being in the spotlight, so I'll keep my remarks brief. Suffice it to say, the company owes Larry a depth of gratitude for his leadership with many contributions, so we wish him well as he heads into his retirement.","So while we're going to miss Larry's experience and talents, we do have a robust succession plan that provides I think a really rich source of internal talent. And I'm excited about the opportunity to give some of our strongest leaders, many of whom you've met or seen on the road, some new and expanded responsibilities. As we talked about in the press release, we're going to be moving to a new structure that has 2 Chief Operating Officers with clear lines of accountability. George Roeth will have P&L responsibility for about half the portfolio and the 4 core functions of marketing, sales, R&D and product supply. And the businesses under George will include Charcoal, Cat Litter, Glad, Food, Brita and Burt's Bees. Now Benno Dorer will have P&L responsibility for the other half of the business and directly manage our corporate strategy and growth activities. So he will lead our Laundry, Home Care and International businesses.","So I think it's important to note that the overall strategies and priorities of the company remain the same. And we have great leadership continuity with -- from Benno and George, and we expect this will be a very seamless transition. In fact, if you look at it, the businesses that are reporting to them, they've led for more than 5 years. So in addition, as I said, Benno is taking on International; and George is picking up our 4 core functions.","I think the other thing I would notice, of the 7 functions in the company, so the core 4 plus finance, HR and legal; 6 of those 7 functions are still being led by the same person. So I think we do have a great continuity with this change. I know many of you have met George and Benno on the road and certainly at the Analyst Day in May, and I'm sure you'll recognize that they've got a real depth of experience and talent that they bring to their new roles. And these roles, as we noted in the press release, are going to be effective January 1. So I hope you would join me in congratulating them on their promotions.","And now with that, let me turn it over to Larry, he can cover the first quarter business results.","Lawrence S. Peiros","Thanks, Don, and welcome to everybody on the call. First, let me say that I've truly enjoyed my 32 years at Clorox. It's a great company and a great group of people. I will probably always have bleach running through my veins, but now is the right time to turn to the next generation of Clorox leaders. I, too, want to congratulate Benno and George. I've worked with each them for many years. They're both incredible businesspeople and also gifted leaders. The company is in very good hands in moving forward.","With that, let's get on with the call and our Q1 business results. We had a solid start to fiscal '13, with 3% sales growth on top of 3% sales growth in the year-ago quarter, and sales up in 3 of our 4 business segments.","Our Q1 volume was down about 1%, primarily driven by price increases taking over the last year to address increases in commodity cost. We also had one less shipping day in the quarter and have seen strong volume results in October.","Overall, we feel good about the growth in Q1 and confident about our 3% to 4% sales growth outlook for the full year, solid performance in what remains a very tough economic climate.","Turning to U.S. market share, this is the first earnings release in which we are reporting share results based on the new multi-outlet data. Because I think most of you know, this data includes gathered data from Walmart and a few other retailers that were not previously sharing information with syndicated suppliers like IRI and Nielson. The new database covers about 80% of our U.S. retail sales. The remaining 20% is in accounts like Costco, Home Depot and PetSmart that do not share data.","Our U.S. multi-outlet share results reflect a 0.3 point decline versus a year ago in Q1 and a 0.1 point decline over the past 52 weeks. Our categories grew about 2% over the last year. Burt's Bees is not included in this data as we track and analyze that brand separately, Burt\u2019s grew share in both Q1 and the past 52 weeks.","Our Cleaning segment delivered a strong quarter, with volume up 4% and sales up 8% behind the volume gains in pricing. Sales driven in each of the business unit that make up the segment. The Home Care business grew sales behind solid volume growth in our portfolio of Clorox-branded Cleaning products, including strong gains of Clorox disinfecting wipes, behind back-to-school merchandising. Liquid-Plumr also grew volume behind our Double Impact new product launch. Volume gains at Home Care were offset by declines on Pine-Sol due to a substantial price increase driven by escalating pine-oil cost. Our overall Home Care market share was up in Q1, and this category is growing about 2%.","Turning to the Laundry business, sales were up behind the strongest volume growth in Clorox liquid bleach in more than 2 years. Our Clorox 2 brand remains challenged, with significant volume losses stemming from the continued impact of a price increase in the year-ago quarter. Our total Laundry share was down slightly in the quarter.","In August, we began the first of our 4-wave rollout of our new concentrated bleach in the Midwest and the launch of wave 2 in the Southeast in October. The conversion has gone very well thus far, with almost all private label offerings converting to the new concentrated format. We expect to complete our national conversion next spring and anticipate a smooth transition.","On the Professional Products business, we saw another strong quarter. Volume was up by more than 50%, driven by the recent acquisitions, and a double-digit increase from the base business.","Our Household segment was the one segment that did not generate sales growth due to double-digit declines on our Charcoal business. Segment volume declined 7% and sales declined 3%. Charcoal shipments were impacted by price increases earlier in the year, as well as lapping some very strong merchandising and very strong volume growth in the year-ago quarter. Due to the seasonality of the business, Charcoal had less of an impact in Q2, and we look forward to a strong grilling season starting next spring.","Turning to the Glad business, we grew both volume and sales behind the continued success of our premium Glad OdorShield trash bags with Febreze. Trash bag gains were partially offset by losses on some of our Glad food storage products. Share was up in trash bags and down a bit on food storage.  The Cat Litter business was down slightly from a sales standpoint, with volume losses stemming from made pricing actions.","In our Lifestyle segment, volume was down 1% and sales increased 1%. We grew both volume and sales in our Food business behind gains in our Hidden Valley brand. Share results were also positive. On Burt's Bees, sales were flat versus a very strong base period that included heavy new product pipeline shipments. Burt's Bees share was up in the quarter and consumption was -- growth was up double digits.","Moving to Brita, sales were down less than 1% as a result of a July price increase and lapping the launch of the Brita Bottle. We have additional Brita innovation coming in the second half that is expected to drive incremental growth.","In our International segment, volume was down 2%, largely due to the exit of some nonstrategic export businesses. Sales were up 3% driven by pricing. Within Latin America, our largest region, we saw both volume and sales growth in our base business. Our market share is up in Latin America, but down in Canada. Category sales growth in Latin America remains stronger than the U.S., while category trends in our more developed International markets are similar to the U.S.","Overall, we feel very good about our Q1 top line results and remain on track for our sales outlook of 2% to 4% for the full year, while volume was down in the quarter due primarily with the predictable impact of pricing actions taken over the last year.","In the U.S., we're seeing modest price promotion by some competitors as commodity costs have been relatively flat. We are closely tracking competitive activity and in some select cases, responding in kind with additional promotional dollars to keep our brand strong.","On the International side, we are closely monitoring consumption, foreign exchange rates and the impact of price controls on our 2 largest Latin American markets: Argentina and Venezuela. Although consumption has improved recently, inflation remains high, price controls remain in place and the currencies are at risk of further devaluation.","Finally, with respect to new products, we are confident of our FY '13 program, including finishing the [indiscernible] conversion to concentrated Clorox Bleach, the new packaging innovation that we launched across all of our spray cleaners this quarter and some exciting innovations on Brita in the second half.","With that, I'll turn it over to Steve.","Stephen M. Robb","Thanks, Larry, and welcome, everyone. We had a good start to the fiscal year. And as you saw on the press release, we reconfirmed our outlook. I'm going to provide more depth on our first quarter results and our financial outlook for fiscal '13.","Starting with sales, we delivered 3% sales growth in the quarter, which included 3 points of price increases and over a point from acquisitions, partially offset by nearly a point from the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. Volume was all also down about a point due to the pricing increases.","Turning to gross margin, we're very pleased with our efforts to rebuild margins are beginning to pay off. Our first quarter gross margin increased 110 basis points to 42.9% of sales compared with 41.8% in the year-ago quarter. The biggest factors contributing to the gross margin improvement were strong cost savings across our portfolio of $26 million, with $22 million of that reflected in gross margin and the benefit of price increases. These factors were partially offset by inflationary pressures in manufacturing and logistics and other supply chain costs.","As expected, commodity cost were about flat, and we anticipate an overall flat commodity environment for the fiscal year with some variability across the quarters.","For the full year, we continued to anticipate the combined benefit of cost savings, and price increases will enable us to deliver both gross margin and EBIT margin expansion. We also continue to anticipate 150 basis points of margin benefit from our cost savings programs.","First quarter selling and administrative expense increased versus the year-ago quarter, due in part to the continued infrastructure investments, including our IT investments in Latin America. We recently completed our IT systems rollout in the region as planned, with all 12 countries now up and running on the new system. And we're pleased with how well the implementation has gone so far, and we're now moving to the next phase of stabilization of these systems.","As previously communicated, we continue to anticipate fiscal '13 spending against our systems and facilities investments, as well as other infrastructure-related investments, to be about equal to fiscal '12 or in the range of $50 million to $55 million.","Overall, we expect selling and administrative costs to be about 15% of sales in fiscal '13, reflecting infrastructure investments, as well as the continued high inflation in many international markets.","Our effective tax rate of 31.6% for the current quarter was up versus the year-ago quarter but lower than anticipated, driven by the benefit of a recent international tax settlement. For the full fiscal year, we anticipate our effective tax rate will be between 33% and 34%.","Turning to cash flow. Free cash flow increased to $154 million or 11.5% of sales compared with $94 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was the result of improving margins and favorable changes in working capital, partially offset by higher capital spending. As a reminder, we define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures.","We ended the quarter with a much higher-than-normal cash balance. Specifically in September, we issued $600 million of senior notes with an annual fixed interest rate of 3.05%, temporarily increasing our cash balance. Net proceeds from the September borrowing we're used to repay commercial paper and all of our $350 million of senior notes, which matured on October 15. We anticipate cash returning to a more normal level by December 31.","Now due to the $600 million debt issuance in September, we ended the quarter with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.7:1, slightly above our 2x to 2.5x. The debt-to-EBITDA calculation, however, does not factor in the higher-than-normal cash balance at the end of the quarter. Including our cash balance, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is well within our targeted range. We continue to anticipate reducing our leverage as we go through the year, and by the end of the year, anticipate being at about the midpoint of our targeted range.","Net of all the factors I've discussed today, we delivered diluted net earnings per share of $1.01, a 3% increase versus the year-ago quarter.","Turning to our fiscal year outlook, we continue to anticipate sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%. As previously communicated, our outlook continues to anticipate modest category growth, continued product innovation across our portfolio and some foreign currency headwinds. This range also reflects a more challenging comparison into strong fiscal '12 sales growth in the back half of the fiscal year.","We continue to anticipate EBIT margin expansion of 25 to 50 basis points and diluted earnings per share in the range of $4.20 to $4.35. We're also closely monitoring our international markets, particularly in Venezuela and Argentina, where price controls and high inflation have been negatively impacting our business.","In closing, I'm very pleased with our results for the first quarter and remain confident in our plans for the balance of the fiscal year.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to Don.","Donald R. Knauss","Okay. Thanks, Steve. So I think in summary, we're off to a good start to the fiscal year. We're, I think, especially pleased that we delivered increases in both sales and margins in the quarter. And although it's still early and there are factors we need to watch closely, we're certainly confident in our outlook and our plans for the balance of the fiscal year. I think in particular, we're encouraged about the growth we continue to see in our categories, and we believe our product innovation plans will help drive continued category growth and maintaining the strength of our brands. And the next wave of innovation for us, of course, is in the January timing.","We certainly do have a proven track record of innovation. I think, as many of you know, for the last 10 years, we've delivered against the annual target of at least 2 points of incremental growth. And right now, I can say with high confidence, we're on track to meet our higher target of 3 points of growth in this fiscal year.","So as Larry mentioned, we're pleased with the introduction of new concentrated Clorox Bleach that's doing quite well and feel great about the new products that we've lined up for this January launch.","So with that, why don't we open it up for your questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Joe Lachky with Wells Fargo.","Joe Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Congratulations on your retirement, Larry.","Lawrence S. Peiros","Thank you.","Joe Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess I'm a little bit concerned with the volume being negative this quarter, and I know you mentioned pricing was an impact there. But it seemed like in the last half of 2012, you guys were able to offset that a little bit and gain volume, even though you had a significant pricing. And I guess the 3% pricing in the quarter, it seems like we're almost getting to a point where it lapsed. So is this volume just like a temporary impact of like maybe weakness in Household, kind of one-offs in Charcoal and that sort of thing? What are you guys kind of expecting going forward? Can we see that volume start to turn around?","Lawrence S. Peiros","So let me give you a perspective on volume in the quarter, and the overwhelming factor is pricing. And you know we've been taking a lot of pricing, some of it fairly recent, to offset the commodity cost. And I expect that, that particular factor to be with us pretty much throughout the year. We did have one less shipping day, which doesn't sound like a big deal but does impact you a bit in terms of delivery in the quarter. We did have a weak quarter on Charcoal. And it really was indexing off of a very high base period driven by some incredible merchandising. I think if you go back to the year-ago quarter, you'll remember us talking about some particularly hot feature pricing in places like Home Hardware -- the Home Hardware Channel where they're trying to drive traffic with the Kingsford brand. And then a little bit of a [indiscernible] from nonstrategic export issue in International. So I would say the one factor that will continue is really the pricing factor. The one less shipping day, we're already making up for that in the current quarter. Charcoal will be back to normal. Of course it won\u2019t impact as much than not only because it's pretty small now, but we expect a normal year. And we start lapping this little bit of a nonstrategic export issue immediately. So I expect it will be about flattish for the year and most of it will be around the pricing impact.","Donald R. Knauss","Yes. Look, the only thing I'd add, Joe, is if you take this one less shipping day for example -- it doesn't -- as Larry said it doesn\u2019t sound like a lot, but we do on average about 1.5 million cases a day. Our volume decline in the quarter was 800,000 cases. So if we've had the normal shipping day, we would've a positive volume. So I think there will be some pricing impact throughout the year. And I think Charcoal, as Larry said, will return to more normalcy now. So I wouldn't put too much into the quarter.","Joe Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then if I could just ask you a quick one on category growth. And correct me if I'm wrong here, I think you said category growth was up 2% in the quarter. Is that all outlet? I mean -- and I guess if you look at it on the track channel data, which is all we can see, looked like some of the key categories like garbage and lawn bags and bleach and charcoal, the growth is kind of sequentially slowing there. So what are you guys seeing on an all outlook basis as far as category growth? Is it stabilizing? Is it increasing? And how is that trending?","Lawrence S. Peiros","Okay. So just to clarify there, the all-outlet data that we referred to now is really the MULO data, which is 80% coverage. So of course we don't have any -- no longer have any kind of category growth numbers on these untracked customers like the Home Hardware, that specialty channel and Costco. We've obviously tracked our result, but we can't track the category. So if you look at the MULO, the multi-outlet data, the category is growing about 2%. If you look at that versus history, we've seen a delta of improvement of about 1 to 2 points over the last 3 years or so. So we are seeing some recovery in our categories. There is always variability category-by-category. Differences are driven by various things like innovation, in particular. But overall, the categories are about 2% on the quarter in the multi-outlet data.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I also wanted to congratulate Larry on retirement. Good luck. It was very, very enjoyable working with you over the last few years. So good luck with that.","Lawrence S. Peiros","Thank you.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","In terms of the EBIT margin, I think that was the biggest surprise, the gross margin being higher and also the EBIT margin being higher. Could you kind of walk us through what the big surprises were to you at least in the quarter?","Stephen M. Robb","Yes, Joe, this is Steve Robb. And as expected, we fully anticipated that the gross margin would be up on the quarter; and of course, it was. But it came in better than we had expected. There was really 2 drivers for that. Number one is our cost savings program. Cost savings came in very strong. As you know, we target 150 basis points of margin improvement from the cost savings programs each year, and we've got about 170 basis points in the first quarter. The second driver was the timing of certain manufacturing costs. Our inventory levels we're running a little bit higher because of the SAP implementation and some new product work. And so we had some favorability come through inventory absorption. And some of that is going to reverse out in subsequent quarters. So I would say the fact that we did better in the first quarter on an EBIT-margin basis is really a reflection of the strong gross margin. But I would not have you take all of the goodness from the first quarter and project it to the full year. A good part of that's going to fall, but not all of it because some of that is in fact timing. Nonetheless, we feel great about the margin improvement plans, and they're working for us.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just secondly, you mentioned earlier that there is some competitive activity going on in some of your categories. I imagine that includes Glad, but which of the categories are you seeing the most intense competitive pressures?","Lawrence S. Peiros","Joe, let me first go back to the first question on category consumption, because Don pointed out that I was -- the 2% I referred to in terms of category growth is a 52-week data, the past quarter is more like 1%. So we have seen a bit of a change there. With respect to competitive activity, definitely most acute in the Glad business and the Glad Trash business, specifically. That's very typical when you see commodity pressure -- price pressure relief that some competitors peeled back some of that commodity savings in terms of trade spending. And that's where we are responding to some degree in kind relative to the competition. The rest of the portfolio, I would say, we're -- it's fairly quiet.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. So it's really concentrated in Glad Trash at this point?","Lawrence S. Peiros","Yes.","Operator","And our next question will come from Jason Gere with RBC Capital Markets.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I guess I just want to kind of go back to the price elasticity that you talked about, what you saw this quarter. Can you just kind of frame up how pricing was -- the effect on volume compared to maybe what you saw a couple of years ago when we're at the heart of the recession and obviously, there was a trying time to take pricing through. So did you see this -- I guess I'm trying to frame up the consumer and right now, the impact of pricing on the consumers. The consumer is weak as you anticipated. I do have a follow-up after that.","Lawrence S. Peiros","So in terms of the -- I think we've talked many, many times about all these models that we run, which are terribly predictive of the impact of what our pricing actions are going to be. And I would say those predictions remain very high, very accurate. We have not seen any difference in elasticity, by and large, during the economic downturn. So it maybe -- I'm sure a little counterintuitive, but we have not really seen a change in elasticity driven by the economic downturn. What you just see, obviously, is people seeking more value and trading up for larger sizes and bigger packs. So there is that kind of value in tact because of the recession. And we can see -- continue to see that in things like trash bags and wipes where people are trading up to either the club sizes or larger packs within other channels.","Donald R. Knauss","The only thing I'd add, Jason, is through panel data now, we know that about a little over 80% of the shopping trips are -- combined as still in trips. So this is buying 15 items or less. So clearly, people are doing a lot of channel-hopping, value-seeking, looking for the deals. But despite that, I think the model accuracy that we've seen has been very high.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I guess the next question is really kind of looking at advertising versus promotional spending. And I think you're saying in Glad, there's a little bit more promotional spending out there. The advertising levels have been kind of near the low of your long-term 9% to 10%, so with some of that gross margin upside that you're seeing. Category growth, I think you're saying, is now closer to the 1% in the quarter. What are the plans -- at least what you can say in terms of reinvesting a bit more of the gross margin upside into advertising so you can kind of hit that 2% to 4% sales growth with ease?","Stephen M. Robb","This is Steve Robb. Let me lead off on this question. So the advertising, as we have communicated and expected, was about 9% of sales; and that's in the 9% to 10% range. I think if you pull up the International business and look at the U.S. domestic business, the number was closer to 10%. Keep in mind that some of our international markets, particularly those markets where we're focusing on price controls and other challenges, we're trying to be smart in the deployment of our advertising dollars, creating the demand that you may or may not want to fill is a challenge. And so I think we feel good about the advertising levels. I think over the long term, as we rebuild the gross margins, we'll make sure that we're reinvesting to keep the brand equities healthy over the long term. But I feel very good about the level of investment we're making today.","Donald R. Knauss","Yes, I think that's the important point on this is that the U.S. spending is at the upper end of the range. It's just the international drag; and particularly, Venezuela, Argentina with the price controls, it doesn't make a lot of sense to do a lot of advertising until we get the price gaps, right?","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And Larry, congratulations.","Lawrence S. Peiros","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take the next question from Ali Dibadj.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And just to share, congrats again, Larry, and Benno and George. To get to a couple of things, wondered if you could talk a little bit more in detail about the drivers of top line growth that you expect accelerating going forward? You talk a little bit about innovation, if you could talk a little bit more about that. And also the impact of the concentrated bleach in that kind of calculation given some of your tougher compares across the board.","Lawrence S. Peiros","So innovation is definitely will be the #1 driver of improvement over time. And we feel very good about our innovation program. We've exceeded our target last year, and we expect to be near above our target for this year. It's pretty much across the board, so it's not a focused on 1 or 2 business units, but it's pretty broad-based. And I'd say that's the #1 thing that will drive growth and drive both brand growth as well as category growth.","Donald R. Knauss","The other thing I would add, Ali, is the Healthcare business, as we talked at the May Analyst Meeting with all of you, we look at the business in 3 chunks: the U.S. Retail product, Professional Products and International. I think if you look at Professional Products, there's another acceleration there for our business, even the base -- we talked about the base business in health care being up double-digits again. We see that continuing to ramp up. So as we go through the balance of the year, as we integrate Aplicare and HealthLink and we see some cross-synergies, if you will, in terms of, for example, the HealthLink sales force selling Clorox disinfecting germicidal wipes into doctors' offices, there's another piece of top line acceleration. And then I think lastly, we are seeing some stabilization in some of the international markets. We'll see what happens in Venezuela with the devaluation. We fully expect it, but we are seeing some fairly good volume growth in a lot of the Latin American countries along with price growth.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So I'll get to International in a second, but just if you could help me with the concentrated bleach part in particular, that question. So as that\u2019s rolling out, what type of volumes are you seeing, what type of category response are you seeing? We see it just as well as you do that the private label in any other brands in that area, if any, are following. So what are your hopes from that particular innovation, if you can share those?","Lawrence S. Peiros","Well, it's early. Really hard to conclude from the anecdotal and data we have. But I would say, anecdotally, we're seeing very positive trends in terms of shipments. I was -- I visited a bunch of stores in Chicago, which is part of the first wave, the shelves look terrific. Private labels have followed. We haven't really lost any incremental -- haven't lost any shelf space. So remember, facings on shelf is higher and out-of-stocks are therefore down. We saw the first growth in terms of CLB shipments in 2 years in the quarter. So we're hoping this will stabilize and start to grow the Clorox Bleach business over time. We're pretty optimistic at this point, but it's definitely early going. As I've said, we've been in wave 1 for about 2 to 3 months and just started wave 2, and we'll finish out at the end of the fiscal year.","Donald R. Knauss","I think the other thing I would add is we're seeing better growth in the wave 1 conversion markets than we are in the balance of the country. So I think some of that may be due to out-of-stocks going down over the weekends. Also, there's more shelf presence for some of the higher-margin trade-up items like gel bleach in those shelf sets. So as Larry said, it's early, but those trends bode well, we think.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And is it -- so is it better or worse that [indiscernible] falls. It sounds like you're saying it's a positive because it probably raises confusion, kind of gets everybody on the same page from a consumer perspective, it\u2019s a bigger driver.","Lawrence S. Peiros","Absolutely. We did this before in many other categories couldn\u2019t have converted to a more concentrated formula. And you definitely want the category to convert with you so that you're price value perception doesn't get out of whack with a competitive set. So we work very hard with our retailers to convert the entire category versus just our brand.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. Then 2 other relatively quick ones, one is on inventory. So you've been doing SAP for a while, but this is the highest inventory day -- at least I\u2019ve seen in a long, long time, many, many years. And so how much of that really is SAP versus some lower-than-expected volumes for resetting because of the concentration on bleach or Charcoal or -- can you maybe just aggregate that for us in terms of what the driver of the increased inventory?","Stephen M. Robb","We certainly adjust on a couple of the drivers. SAP is certainly a part of this. We -- don't forget, in the last 3 or 4 months, we've been bringing up quite a few of our Latin American countries and we've got all 12 countries now up and running. And we did bill some inventory in advance of that just to make sure that if there was any disruption, which we're pleased that there wasn't, but then we would have inventory on hand to be able to work through that. We also were building up some inventory to work through the transition to the new bleach and then just felt the new products. So inventory is up a bit, but we've got plans in place to bring that back down again to a more normalized level, and feel good right now about the inventory levels.","Donald R. Knauss","Right. And I think just to put into perspective, the total inventory levels for the company in dollars we're about 2.5% above where they were last year in the quarter. So I don't think it's a significant move.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Even with the 1 day lost adding on okay, its looks like they\u2019ll go down. And then do you want to get back to the International comment, so what are you seeing? Because we're not seeing necessarily great trends in Latin America in many categories, save for Venezuela. So if you were to exclude Venezuela, it sounds like you're entering new areas. Can you give us a little bit more of a view on that? And then also about how you're thinking about Venezuela specifically in that region?","Lawrence S. Peiros","So we are seeing growth in our Latin America business, which is the biggest -- by far, the biggest chunk of our International business. So I would say, the results on the top line are pretty good. We are seeing kind of high single-digit growth in terms of the categories. Actually, we're growing share right now across the categories, so we're feeling pretty good about that. The issue in Latin America is obviously on the bottom line more than the top line at this point, so where we have price controls. And unfortunately, 2 of our biggest countries are where there are price controls, Venezuela and Argentina. That's where we're having some margin pressure, and that shows up obviously in the segment results. Now part of the decline in profit in the segments is due to the SAP implementation, which we have just completed. But a lot of this is due to the pressure that we had to improve margins while price controls are in effect and we had high inflation rate. But the volume and sales rate looks, I think, very solid.","Donald R. Knauss","Just to give you a little color on that, Ali, if you look at -- give you an example of 3 countries: Mexico, Peru and Chile, 3 of our larger midsized countries in Latin America, we're seeing volume growth in the mid- to high-single digits. I think one of the reasons the volume is a little bit less than those countries are putting out is because of the export business we exited in Central America, which we didn't think was profitable or know it wasn't profitable. So I think the base trends in those countries look pretty good.","Operator","Our next question will come from Chris Ferrara with Bank of America.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Could we -- I just want to follow-up on Venezuela. Could you talk I guess a little bit perspectively about what you think Venezuela could possibly look like over the coming months, right? I mean, I think it seems like a foreground conclusion you're going to see a devaluation. Can you talk about how you'd handicap the odds of price control sustaining, remaining in place even through a devaluation and I guess what you're doing to prep for that?","Stephen M. Robb","This is Steve. Let me take the first part of that, and maybe Larry can weigh in on some of the business things that we're doing. I think we, like everyone else, fully expect that there's going to be a devaluation in Venezuela. And in fact, as we've previously communicated, we've included in our earnings per share outlook about a $0.05 earning drag because we believe a devaluation is highly likely. What's uncertain to us, and I think others, is how much of a devaluation we're going to see and when it's actually going to occur. We've tried to take appropriate actions in terms of making sure that you don't overinvest in the country, making sure that you deploy your assets as effectively as you can to minimize the impact of the devaluation. But at the end of the day, there's very little that you can actually do to prevent it. You basically have to respond once it actually occurs. And we think we've taken all of the appropriate steps. As far as price controls, again, over the very long term, price controls are very difficult to keep in place and maintain their effectiveness. But I think we expect that price controls will continue even after a devaluation, at least for some period of time. Although generally, after devaluation, what you tend to see is you get some pricing flexibility will tend to open up a bit. But I think we're going to have to just see what the government does and then respond in kind.","Lawrence S. Peiros","Yes, in terms of the sales of ARM [ph] results, we're positive in Venezuela at this point. So that's good. Categories, I would say, are kind of flattish, not a lot of growth. And as Steve said, we don't know when the devaluation will hit, and we don't know what the impact might be on price controls post-devaluation. But right now, about 70% of our portfolio is affected by the price controls.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And a quick follow-up, I guess. Do you guys still expect EBIT margins to be down in the first half of the year?","Stephen M. Robb","I think EBIT margin is going to be a little bit better than that because obviously, we had good growth in the first quarter driving the gross margins. So EBIT margins are not likely to be down in the first half, but they will continue to be challenged because we're completing the SAP implementation in Latin America and\/or investments in Pleasanton, California. So I think you're still going to see some challenges there.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Right. But you're not changing your full year EBIT margin outlook right? So I guess some of that relates to what the timing on the manufacturing variances you're talking about that will -- that you'll give back in the back half of the year, is that the way you're thinking about it?","Stephen M. Robb","Yes. And we've got a range on it. The 25 to 50 basis points, I would say we're off to a very good start to hit the 25 to 50 basis points or probably even more confident today than we would've been 90 days ago. But we still believe that 25 to 50 basis points of EBIT margin makes sense. And again, as we just talked, we're closely monitoring situations, including Venezuela, which depending on what happens there, that can also have an impact on margins.","Operator","Next is Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","Nicholas Cavallo - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's Nick Cavallo filling in for Bill. Just wanted to ask quickly about the Lifestyle segment. And I think you guys have laid out the drivers of at least most of the volume decline in the quarter. But curious in this segment in particular, if you've seen any inventory destocking or any changes in customer ordering patterns? And then secondly, I was wondering if you would actually tell us what the sales decline was for Brita On-The-Go in the quarter?","Lawrence S. Peiros","So no significant inventory changes that I'm aware of, so nothing there that I can point to. There is a comparison on Burt's Bees to a quarter that had a lot of pipeline on new products. And so this -- the results were kind of flattish for the quarter, but the consumption rate is actually very high. So the business is very healthy. We just hit kind of a year-over-year comparison issue that deflated the shipments.","Nicholas Cavallo - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got it. And do you have the sales decline for Brita On-The-Go?","Donald R. Knauss","We don't release that level of information, but the Brita On-The-Go continues to do very well for us, and we're very pleased with the results.","Lawrence S. Peiros","We're just launching the introductory period, and that's what drove it down somewhat.","Operator","Next is Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","I have -- I mean, I'm going to the micro level, but it has to do with the $50 million to $55 million spending and how that impact operating margins calculations on your guidance. Could you at least tell us 2 things: one, whether if you can -- did that spending last year had -- was lumpy or was evenly spread? And when do you think the $50 million to $55 million spending is going to be over this year? I -- my understanding is, is that it's going to go all the way to June next year. So if you can let us know when do you expect to complete the idea IT spending on the R&D facility?","Stephen M. Robb","Javier, this is Steve. So we are anticipating still $50 million to $55 million of restructuring and other related costs. The bulk of it, as a reminder to everyone, is the IT investments we're making in Latin America and the rebuilding of our R&D facilities in Pleasanton, California. We expect a disproportion amount of that is going to fall in the first half of the fiscal year, but we also continue to expect cost to continue into the second half. So it will continue through Q3 and Q4 of this fiscal year. In terms of the -- how that fell in the first quarter to give you a little bit of color, we did see a larger amount come in this quarter versus the same period in the year ago. We had about $14 million, $15 million of infrastructure-related costs this year, and we had about $7 million last year. So that's part of the reason you're saying SG&A was up a bit in the first quarter of this fiscal year.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","And going into the -- I mean, just for modeling reasons, going into the second quarter, it seems like we should be modeling a pretty big hike in that spending as you accelerate for the completion of all these 2 projects, right?","Stephen M. Robb","I don't want to get into the quarter-by-quarter split. But let me just say, a bit more than 50% is going to certainly fall in the first half and a bit less than 50% will fall in the second half. And we're going to continue to see expenses, obviously, come through the second quarter. You are likely to see SG&A as a percentage of sales higher in the second quarter because of the seasonality of sales and these investments that we've talked about. I think that gives you a pretty good sense for your modeling.","Operator","And we'll now go to Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And let me also offer my congratulations to Larry, George and Benno. About Venezuela, the $0.05 hit in this fiscal year, does that assume Venezuela operates at a loss or margins are just compressed? Secondly, should we -- assuming first a January timeframe for devaluation, do you think it's wise to put another $0.05 into the back half of the calendar year, which would be the first part of your fiscal -- next fiscal year? And then finally, if the business goes into a loss, do you make a determination at some point on whether or not it's in your interest to stay there?","Stephen M. Robb","Okay. Let me see if I can answer you to those in turn. So first, we don't give out the relative profitably of the countries, but the #1 challenges we've indicated before is the rising inflation and the pressure that it creates on margins, particularly in a price-controlled environment. So it's really a margin challenge that we're having. Second, we have a good business in Venezuela today. The business is stabilizing. We've got leading brands. Even with everything that's going on, we're going to continue to invest for the long-term health of the business, and we like the business. But clearly, we're going to be challenged over the next couple of quarters. And then finally, regarding the devaluation, we wish we knew the timing. We don't. We put a $0.05 placeholder into the outlook because we recognize this as a fairly high risk that something is going to happen. But as I mentioned earlier, the timing, the amount is unclear. So I don't think we can predict whether the $0.05 is sufficient or whether you need another $0.05. I think we need to see what the government does one, with the devaluation; and then two, how that manifests in the form of price controls and what adjustments they make there if any. So we're just going to need more time on that, but we'll keep people updated as we all learn more.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Are you having any negotiations or conversations with the government about the tradeoff between price controls and actually being able to supply retailers and consumers?","Lawrence S. Peiros","So there definitely are ongoing conversations with the government. The government has reached out to manufacturers. I can't say that we've seen a lot of impact from those conversations just yet, but they are going on.","Donald R. Knauss","And I'm hoping, Connie, that post the election now, that those conversations will become more fruitful than they were before the election.","Operator","We'll now go to John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Larry, congratulations as well.","Lawrence S. Peiros","Thanks, John.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","There've been a number of incremental restructuring announcements over the past few months from many of the consumer companies, even ones like you that have sort of a strong history of delivering on cost saves. And I guess I'm wondering if there's some sort of sense that companies need to run faster these days just to standstill? And I know you're a little more optimistic about the categories, but it certainly seems like growth has taken a step function down over the last couple of years. So as you look at that, do you have any thoughts in terms of whether your current sort of incremental approach to cost savings needs to step up in any way? Do you need to start thinking bigger about this? Or do you feel like you have the right approach right now? And how long can that keep going?","Donald R. Knauss","Yes. Let me start, John. I think because a number of our competitors are who are stepping up, are stepping to get into the range we've delivered. So I think we've been in the zone, as you know, of 150 to 200 basis points a year for multiple years on end. And I think the first quarter of 170 basis points is just another indication that we think we've got the right approach to this. I do think, to your point, that companies are obviously getting more and more focused on cost savings. It's something they can control a lot more than they can control category growth or what the consumer is doing. I think, though, that based on the engagement of our people, the strength of our brands, we want to stay focused on the approach we've got and not whipsaw this organization with this whole notion of big layoffs, which we just don't think are necessary.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. And then is the time frame you guys have historically talked about sort of having visibility, I don't know, like say 4 or 5 years out, do you feel like you still have that level of visibility with your current programs?","Lawrence S. Peiros","Yes, we actually run a 3-year pipeline. So we literally have teams of people as we've talked before that are not just managing cost savings that we're focused on delivering this year of 150 basis points, but they also project out 1, 2 and 3 years and both develop the ideas and then we start to put plans in place. And I think as Don said -- and this is really important, we would rather focus on consistent, steady cost savings results because we think over the long term that translates into better margins than focusing on cost savings for short periods of time, and then people are off doing something else and then they come back to it. So this notion of consistency in your cost savings and focusing on a 3-year pipeline and making what I would define as modest, smart investments over time to support that, we think it's a best-in-class approach. And it certainly worked well for us.","Donald R. Knauss","And I think that systemic approach, John, if you look at once we get past these investments this year, I mean we'll get back into this 13.5% to 14% range, which is a top tiertile performer and we've been there for years. So I think if that systemic consistent approach can deliver that kind of result, we think that's actually the right way to go.","Operator","And at this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Mr. Knauss for any additional or closing remarks.","Donald R. Knauss","Thanks. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call. I know it's been particularly difficult for a number of you, and we certainly hope things start to settle out in the Northeast soon. We'll look forward to talking to you at the -- in February as we get through the second quarter, but thank you for being on the call with us today.","Operator","Thank you very much. And that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect."]}}
