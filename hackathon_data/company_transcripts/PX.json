Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded.","I'd now like to introduce your host for today's program, Kelcey Hoyt, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Kelcey E. Hoyt - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Jonathan. Good morning and thank you for attending our first quarter earnings call and webcast.","I'm joined this morning by Matt White, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Liz Hirsch, our Vice President and Controller.","Today's presentation materials are available on our website at praxair.com in the Investors Section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference.","In addition, please note that sequential comparisons include non-GAAP adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2014, and the reconciliation to the U.S. GAAP reported numbers are in the appendix to this presentation, and the press release.","Matt and I will now review Praxair's first quarter results, including the current business environment, and updated earnings guidance. We'll then be available to answer questions.","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Kelcey, and good morning, everyone. For the first quarter, Praxair delivered earnings per share of $1.43. This result was in the middle of our January guidance range despite an incremental $0.03 headwind from weakening foreign currencies since our last earnings call. Negative foreign currency translation impact has been quite significant, both in the magnitude and speed of devaluation. In fact, several global currencies had reached 10-year lows against the U.S. dollar.","While we can't predict where future rates will go, we will continue to protect the business through strong contracts and prudent investment decisions. So, we'll experience short-term swings in reported earnings but still generate long-term enterprise value.","Looking around the world, general industrial activity is still muted as certain growth areas like India and the United States are mostly offset by deceleration in China and recessionary conditions in Brazil. Furthermore, the very strong U.S. dollar and weak commodity pricing has created challenges for certain U.S. industries specifically energy and metals producers, who are now running at fairly low utilization rates.","The customers that we serve are being impacted by these economic headwinds, and thus are affecting our growth rates. Despite these challenges, we are taking actions to preserve our profitability today and position ourselves for highly accretive growth for the future. We continue to manage cost and drive productivity, as evidenced by our 30-basis-point operating margin expansion this quarter. We are successfully raising price, especially in higher inflation regions such as the 6% improvement we achieved in South America.","We are closely managing the balance sheet to maximize free cash flow, as can be seen in our year-over-year working capital improvement. And we continue to win new business for future growth and density improvements, such as our recently announced long-term supply contracts for U.S. Gulf Coast ammonia project and the CNOOC refinery and petrochemical project in China.","So, while the macroeconomic headwinds are weighing on our current reported earnings, we continue to pursue density-growth opportunities while improving the quality of the business. This combination positions us well for highly accretive growth when the growth cycle returns.","I'd now like to hand it off to Kelcey to walk through the financial results.","Kelcey E. Hoyt - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Matt. Please turn to slide number 3 for our consolidated results. Excluding negative foreign currency translation impact and cost pass-through, sales grew 1%, operating profit was steady, and earnings per share grew 4% year over year. Sales for the quarter were $2.8 billion, and organic growth of 1% year over year came primarily from price attainment.","Overall volumes were comparable to the prior-year quarter, as growth from new plant startups, as well as higher volumes to refineries, healthcare, food and beverage, and manufacturing customers globally was offset by declining upstream energy demand and weaker steel demand.","Sales grew 1% from the fourth quarter from higher pricing, primarily in South America and Europe. Sequentially, volumes decreased 3%, including the typical seasonal impact of Carnival and Lunar New Year as well as impacts from upstream energy and metals end markets.","Operating profit was $623 million. Excluding currency impact, operating profit was steady with the prior-year period, as higher price, productivity gains, and acquisitions were offset primarily by lower volumes in South America, as well as prior-year quarter benefits in Europe and South America that did not repeat.","We are seeing positive traction from prior-quarter cost actions and ongoing cost control, which expanded the EBITDA margin 100 basis points to a record 33% and the operating margin, 30 basis points to 22.6%. Net income of $416 million includes the benefit of lower interest expense.","During the quarter, we repaid $500 million of 4.625% notes that became due and issued $750 million of notes with an average tenor of 13 years, and an average rate of 2.45%. The debt-to-EBITDA ratio remains stable at 2.3 times.","Earnings per share of $1.43 increased 4% year over year excluding negative currency translation impact. EPS benefited from a 2% reduction in the number of diluted shares outstanding as a result of net repurchases of common stock. During the quarter, we repurchased $191 million of stock net of issuances. About $800 million remains available under the current authorized share repurchase program.","Our after-tax return on capital this quarter was 12.6% and return on equity was 29.6%. Our project backlog, which we define as projects with CapEx greater than $5 million and associated with a fully executed customer supply contract grew to $2.1 billion and is comprised of 21 projects.","During the quarter, we signed new long-term contracts for plants in North America and Asia and started up plants in Asia, South America and Europe. Geographically, our current backlog is about half weighted towards North America, about 25% in Asia and the remaining 25% for customers in Europe and South America. These projects will serve a diverse set of end markets including energy, chemicals, manufacturing, electronics and metals.","Please turn to slide 4 for our results in North America. Sales in North America were $1.5 billion, 2% above the prior year quarter excluding negative currency translation and cost pass-through. Volume growth of 1% year over year in North America includes modest growth across all three distribution modes: on-site, merchant and packaged gases. Acquisitions of packaged gas distributors contributed 1% growth.","On-site volume growth of 2% year-over-year was driven by strong sales of hydrogen to refinery customers and included spot sales made possible by Praxair's innovative 2.5 billion standard cubic foot high-purity hydrogen storage cavern. This growth was partially offset by lower onsite oxygen sales to metals customers who have been impacted by the lower price of commodities, and strength of the U.S. dollar.","North America metals end-market sales are down 8% year-over-year, and 7% sequentially. North America merchant volume growth year-over-year was modestly positive as growth in the U.S. and Canada was largely offset by Mexico energy-related sales.","The reduced liquid nitrogen sales in our oil well services business in Mexico is a continuation of a trend of lower oil production by Pemex that began in the second quarter of 2014. We expect to lap this year-over-year impact next quarter.","U.S. packaged gas organic sales were steady year-over-year as higher price and moderate gas growth was offset by volume declines in hard goods. U.S. packaged gas transportation-related sales remain strong while end-markets such as metal fabrication, machinery, and energy were weaker.","Mexico packaged gas volumes grew mid-single digit year-over-year, and Canadian packaged gas volumes remained steady. Sequentially, overall North American volumes declined 2%, primarily due to lower sales to metals and energy end-markets.","Price in North America was steady, as low single digit merchant and packaged gas price attainment was offset by lower prices for hydrogen co-products that are indexed to natural gas, primarily steam and carbon monoxide. From what we are seeing, the price environment remains positive overall in North America. Utilization rates for liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen remain at about 80%.","North American operating profit was $379 million, 3% above the prior-year quarter excluding negative currency translation impact. The increase in operating profit was driven by higher volumes and acquisitions. Segment operating margin was 25.3% above the prior year.","During the quarter, we announced our largest-ever individual project with CapEx of approximately $400 million to add hydrogen and nitrogen production capacity and extend our U.S. Gulf Coast pipeline systems approximately 46 miles from Texas City, Texas to the Freeport, Texas area. We have included a map on page 13 of the slide deck in the appendix.","We signed a 20-year agreement to supply approximately $170 million standard cubic feet per day of hydrogen and 2,000 tons per day of nitrogen to an ammonia complex being built by a new entity formed by Yara and BASF. The supply to the complex is expected to start in late 2017. Praxair won this project given several advantages that the customer valued. First was our creativity. As we initially proposed the project to Yara, our joint venture partner in Scandinavia, who then invited BASF to participate as a partner and host.","Secondly, was our ability to capture, process and store by-product hydrogen generated by multiple crackers that are being installed on the U.S. Gulf Coast, including the strength of our relationships and reliable operating history with the ethane cracker operators.","The Yara\/BASF site will be connected to our existing network of hydrogen and nitrogen production in the region including our hydrogen storage cavern, resulting in even stronger reliability. This unique project not only meets our disciplined growth criteria, but also positions us for future opportunities by extending our supply network down to Freeport, Texas. The pipeline activity of U.S. packaged gas distributor acquisitions remains healthy. The targets are smaller and the timing is dependent on the circumstances of each individual distributor.","Now, please turn to page 5 for our results in Europe. Sales in Europe were $326 million, 18% below the prior year quarter. Ex-currency and net divestitures, organic sales growth was 1% above the prior year, primarily due to price attainment in all countries. Sequentially, organic sales were steady as overall price increases were offset by volume declines primarily in the energy end-market.","Operating profit was $62 million, and the operating margin was strong at 19%. The business continues to demonstrate strong operating leverage with minimal volume contribution due to ongoing productivity, cost controls, and price. The prior year quarter included credits from the recovery of energy costs in Italy of about $5 million.","For the remainder of 2015, assuming at least stable to modest volume growth, including new plant startup contribution in Russia, we expect to continue to see at least a high-teens operating margin percentage that reflects continued solid operating leverage with constant focus on fixed costs and productivity.","Page 6 shows our results in South America. South American segment sales were $401 million, 2% above the prior year quarter, ex-currency. Strong price of 6% year-over-year included significant recovery of high inflation in the region. While South America volumes declined 5% year-over-year, the business again outperformed estimated quarterly industrial production of negative 7%.","Application-driven volume growth from healthcare, food and beverage, and environmental customers was more than offset by lower volumes to manufacturing and metals customers. Sequential volume decline includes the seasonal impact of Carnival.","Operating profit in South America was $85 million, down 5% from the prior year ex-currency due to the prior-year quarter having included a gain on an asset sale in Brazil.","During the quarter, we started up small plant serving the oxygen needs of a specialized food and drink packaging manufacturer, a customer of Praxair's for almost 20 years. The S\u00e3o Paulo state-based customer uses Praxair's oxygen in glass furnaces resulting in enhanced combustion, improved efficiency, as well as reduced nitrogen oxide emissions, enabling them to increase productivity and improve their environmental performance.","And while the economic environment is currently challenged in Brazil as the government implements fiscal controls, these measures should be positive for the medium- and long-term. With a stronger balance sheet, the government will be better positioned to invest in needed infrastructure projects and will have ample ability with its current 13% interest rate for reductions to stimulate growth.","Regardless of macroeconomic conditions, we remain diligent in preserving the quality of the existing business. Our local employees are constantly adapting to current conditions and have implemented price actions supported by strong existing contracts and are delivering productivity and controlling cost in a highly inflationary environment.","At the same time, we are successfully winning new business with application technologies in less cyclical end markets such as healthcare, food and beverage, and for environmental purposes such as waste water treatment. The end result is positioning the business for highly accretive growth when any recovery does occur.","Please turn to slide 7 for our results in Asia. Asia's sales for the quarter were $371 million with organic growth of 1% year-over-year. We continue to see strong double-digit growth in India given the improved economic environment driving base business growth. In addition to incremental growth from new plant start-ups, primarily to metals customers. China volume growth from new project start-ups was partially offset by weaker sales to metals customers. Sequentially, volumes declined 4% which included the seasonal Lunar New Year impact. Price was steady as increases in Korea and India were offset by continued price pressure in China.","Asia's operating profit of $69 million decreased primarily due to the impact of a plant sale in the prior quarter, partially offset by lower costs, and productivity gains. During the quarter, we started up plants to supply chemical customers in China. In addition, we signed a long-term contract to provide industrial gases to the China National Offshore Oil Company, CNOOC, a Fortune Global 100 company, and one of the largest in China. The project, expected to start up in 2017, will enable the reliable and efficient supply of industrial gases for CNOOC's refinery and downstream chemical production. Praxair will build, own, and operate two 2,400 ton per day air separation plants in the Daya Bay Chemical Industrial Park located in Guangdong, China. Praxair's product line plants will provide oxygen and nitrogen to CNOOC to support the company's refinery expansion.","In the park, Praxair currently serves CNOOC's existing ethylene oxide and ethylene glycol production, plus six other customers. These plants further position us to supply new customers to the park via pipeline. The project is consistent with our continued efforts to build out density in regions which we believe makes us more competitive.","Our result for surface technologies are shown on page 8. Surface technologies sales for the quarter were $160 million, 2% above the prior year, excluding currency, due primarily to stronger demand for aerospace coatings and higher pricing.","Operating profit of $28 million increased 2%, excluding negative currency impact, with operating leverage on improved organic sales growth and cost control.","And now I'll turn the call back to Matt to discuss our earnings guidance.","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Kelcey. Please turn to slide 9. We are revising our revising our full year earnings guidance to now be $5.90 to $6.15. You can see in the upper right of this slide the key drivers to the guidance reduction from January. The majority of this adjustment, or $0.20, is due to the updated foreign currency translation impact. You can see on the left side a graphic showing the change in some key foreign exchange rate projections since January. Basically, one-third of our global revenues between Brazil, Europe and Canada are anticipated to have twice the currency headwinds as initially estimated. All in, we're projecting the year-over-year EPS impact from foreign currencies to be about $0.64, or a 10% headwind. However, we continue to take actions to mitigate this impact. So, while the translation impact will vary up and down, our cost management and price efforts will provide earnings improvement going forward. We also continue to incorporate currency risks into our project investment opportunities, thus preserving our future returns.","In addition, we are also making a $0.05 to $0.15 guidance adjustment related to lower volumes in the metals and energy markets. Lower oil prices have had negative impacts on both upstream production, as well as the industries that support them. U.S. steel producers have experienced lower volumes from a combination of lower tubular demands to energy, and increased imports due to a stronger dollar. These are cyclical markets, so we've seen this before. However, we continue to work with our customers to help make them more competitive in these market conditions. Our updated annual guidance anticipates EPS growth of 4% to 8% excluding foreign currency. So we still expect to grow underlying earnings mid- to high-single digit in this environment. We reduced our sales guidance to a range of $11.4 billion to $11.7 billion. But we also expect capital expenditures to drop to $1.6 billion from a combination of management actions and weaker currencies.","For the second quarter, our guidance range is $1.40 to $1.48. This range includes an estimated currency headwind of 11% year over year and 2% sequentially. So, in summary, we are managing the things within our control. I'm pleased with the efforts of our employees around the world to drive productivity and pursue price improvements which improve our business quality.","We are also continuing to invest in our core geographies in opportunities that meet our return criteria. All of these actions provide significant earnings growth potential as macro conditions improve. Until then, we will continue to leverage our strong free cash flow to repurchase stock during this harvest cycle.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Mike Sison from KeyBanc. Your question, please.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey. Good morning.","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning, Mike.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","When you think about your volume outlook for 2015, the 2% to 3%, I'm trying to get a gauge of how underlying demand is. Is some of that growth from new projects, and does it kind of suggest that base volume is kind of flattish? Is that the way to look at it?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, Mike, you may recall in the last January call, we had laid out about a 2% to 3% project and sort of 1% to 2% organic. And that came to about a 3% to 5% outlook. What I would say we're seeing now is while there might be some slight delay in the projects, they're still tracking pretty close. And what we're seeing on the organic side is really the on-site is a bit softer. And that's primarily in the metals, which is causing some impact on the top line. There's just less molecules going out in the metals customers.","So that's causing that growth to be a little bit subdued. And on top of that, you still have the continued headwinds in places like Brazil, where we have negative 7% industrial production. So, volume there continues to be challenged. So, those are probably the two drivers that are causing our outlook to be a little softer on the organic.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Right. And then just \u2013 if you step back a little bit and think about maybe 2016 a little bit early, but just sort of the longer-term backdrop for industrial gases. Clearly, the growth rate this year is below what you initially hoped. What are your thoughts longer term? Do you still think this is an industry that will \u2013 can generate some good growth and maybe where do you think Praxair can really get back on track as you head into the outlying years?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I definitely think we can continue to generate good growth. I think the challenge we're facing now is we've got multiple headwinds. We're seeing sluggishness in emerging markets, we're seeing sluggishness across the entire commodity space, so specifically energies and metals but even mining is still very weak. And frankly, you're in a disinflationary environment with governments across the world constraining their spend, so infrastructure spending is quite weak and has been quite weak. So I think all these factors are hitting right now, which are creating just a myriad of headwinds for us. But when I look in the outlook, especially the medium to longer term, I think these things will turn. They are cyclical in nature, and I expect them to turn, and that will give us some good growth. And when we get that growth, it will be highly accretive. We're going to keep these cost savings that we have. We're going to keep the price actions that we've taken. So, when this growth does come, it will be highly accretive and it will drop heavy to our earnings.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.","Matt Andrejkovics - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Good morning. Actually this is Matt Andrejkovics calling for Vincent. Just wanted to ask, was there anything inherent in the first quarter that enabled you to meet the midpoint of the prior guidance but that might be absent for the balance of the year, thus resulting in the reduced guidance?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No. There was no special items if that what you're referring to, or nonrecurring items. In fact, we probably had a little bit more severance in the first quarter here given some of the cost actions we're taking. That was a slight headwind.","Matt Andrejkovics - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then, in Europe, can you indicate how much of the volume weakness was energy's? I guess we would have expected, and it seems like you got some volume benefit from the currency decline?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So yes, in Europe, the primary energy sales are related to our offshore business, called Dominion, and that has been quite weak. That was, frankly, one of the first areas to get hit by low oil as most of the customers they serve are rigs for things like diving gases and other type packaged gases that go on the rigs. So as those rigs have slowed or been idled, we've seen a pretty significant drop in that activity. Excluding energy, I'd say in Europe, it's been slightly improving. We did have one outage called a standard chemical outage in the first quarter here that's going to be starting up here shortly. But we are seeing some improvements in metals, in areas of Southern Europe, we're seeing a little bit of uptick in some of our package gases.","So, while industrial production is slightly positive to slightly negative in areas like Southern Europe, we are seeing some signs of improvement, and that's something we'll continue to hopefully see going forward.","Matt Andrejkovics - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Your question please.","Adam Marshall Seiden - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys. This is Adam Seiden for Duffy Fischer.","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","Adam Marshall Seiden - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I was just \u2013 I guess, Matt, Kelcey. So, over the course of the past several quarters, the number of projects in the backlog has gone down, but the total backlog amount has been increasing. So, with the large downspin in Q1 in the U.S. likely resulting for the higher dollar amount, I was just wondering if you could speak to the dynamics of the backlog and for the international regions, about how many projects have started up in the past quarter and if there were any cancellations or delays?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes. So, we've had a handful start-ups. We've got one project that I'm viewing as inactive right now that we're sort of addressing and working with the customer. And then, we had a couple that we've added, as you mentioned. And what we're seeing right now is the projects are just getting larger. So, the best activity still is the U.S. Gulf Coast and certain parts of Asia as far as \u2013 and specifically China, you're still seeing some opportunities there. So, the two large projects we announced, one being the ammonia project in the U.S. Gulf Coast, is really taking advantage of the low cost hydrogen by-product sources that are being generated from ethylene crackers, and we're able to get in the middle and make that deal happen. And therefore, the ammonia customers can essentially build a very low-cost solution that doesn't need to handle hydrocarbons.","And what you're seeing in China is with the rising demand for transportation fuels, CNOOC is making some expansions of both the refinery aspect, as well as some of the downstream PetChem to be able to take advantage of those growth areas. So these projects are larger. The project on the ammonia was both processed gases and atmospheric gases, and they tend to require more capital, and they're more in some integrated complexes. So while they are lumpier, they do take longer to sign and execute, but they are going to be quite accretive. So that's sort of the trend that we're seeing. And on the other side, we're seeing much smaller projects for things like environmental, food, beverage, and they tend to be very small on-site plants. Those are also doing well. I'd say it's kind of the middle-sized plants that we're not seeing as much growth right now, especially in some of the regions like South America, and areas in Europe.","Adam Marshall Seiden - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's very helpful. Thanks. And I guess just separately, in India, it's been a very strong growth avenue for the company. With new plant start-ups helping to drive growth, so I was just wondering if you could touch on the underlying growth that you're seeing in India going forward, and how we should think about that cadence of growth through 2015 with the JSW, ASU looking like it could possibly start up.","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So there is clearly a lot of momentum and just positive views in India right now, which frankly is a stark opposite of Brazil. But this momentum in investor confidence is really causing more interest and opportunities to make investments both brownfield and greenfield. India is a big recipient of the low oil as they're an importer of hydrocarbons. And they are taking a lot of steps to be more pro-business and business-friendly.","So, the combination of all that coupled with these known infrastructure needs and growth needs that India has, I think is pretty powerful combination that's making it more attractive for investment. Now, we'll have to see long range, if these trends continue, but we're seeing a lot of confidence in our customer base. And we tend to see more opportunities there both on on-site and liquid credit opportunities.","So, we'll keep our discipline. We'll keep our same investment criteria we keep around the world. But there is some optimism there and the momentum seems to be quite positive.","Adam Marshall Seiden - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Very helpful. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts from UBS. Your question, please.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Sure. Thank you. On slide 14, I'm surprised that chemicals are down 7% year-over-year. I didn't think we had that much of a weakness and downtime and lower operating rates. Is that just Praxair specific, did you just get unlucky in terms of your mix of customers?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. So, John, a substantial portion of that actually is natural gas. And maybe I can explain it because it not only impacts this part of the slide, but it impacts the price in North America as well. So, the way we look at natural gas is anything that's related to hydrogen direct sales, we call pass through. And as you know, natural gas dropped 30-plus percent year-over-year, almost $2 a therm. So, anything that's hydrogen-related goes to the pass-through line. Anything that is related to co-products, from a HyCO steam methane reformer such as steam or CO or methanol, that we put to volume and price. Specifically in this case, price. So, that is all wrapped into that chemicals.","As you know, these end markets show a combination of price and volume, but exclude pass-through. So, that actually has a natural gas impact to the co-products, the pricing impact. And that's a substantial portion of that drop. The rest of it are some outages. We had an outage in Europe, an outage in the U.S., and one in Asia, and those are coming up here in these few months here, and one is already up. So, we do expect that to recover back, but you'll see this natural gas sort of pricing co-product impact until we lap it.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","And then secondly, for the on-site metals customers. Are many of your customers near their take-or-pay minimums at this point, or is there still further room to fall to get to minimums on a lot of the business?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. So, we have a handful in the U.S. and a handful in South America right now that are below take-or-pays. So, we are collecting the take-or-pays, but their volumes have dropped below. In Asia, there were a few but that tends to tie more to the Lunar New Year impact. We tend to see this seasonal impact. But in both U.S. and South America, we are seeing a handful in both on the metal side below that number.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James. Your question, please.","Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, Matt, Kelcey, Liz. How are you?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good. Morning, Sam.","Kelcey E. Hoyt - Director-Investor Relations","Morning.","Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","A follow-up on the last question regarding the \u2013 hopefully this is a silly question, the take-or-pay contract structure in the developing markets, what's the susceptibility worst case of being hit by some sort of a force majeure or a legal equivalent? I would imagine it would be low if for no other reason as your share of wallet's low and the critical nature of supply and the inability of some of your competitors to undercut you on a subsequent bid because they don't have the assets in place, but \u2013 has that happened in the past and how susceptible do you think you are, worst case, in that environment?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, I think, Sam, that really comes down to strength of contract and how you define force majeure in a contract. And our language is fairly clear, and force majeure is not economic. And what you're seeing across all of these situations are economic, right? It's supply-demand driven. It's pricing of things like hot rolled or what's going in their individual markets. So, we don't have concerns in this. We are getting paid, like I said, and these are economically driven. If there is a clear force-majeure situation, then we will work with our customer on that, and if it meets the definition and criteria of the contract, then there will be some relief. But at this point, none of these are force majeure situations, and there's no expectation that they will be.","Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And can you remind us what your take-or-pay mix is in the developing markets?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We've never provided that, but I can say this. Every on-site contract we have, there's some form of either fixed facility or take-or-pay structure that we will apply.","Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And last question before I defer to others, you mentioned, Matt, management actions around CapEx, not just taking it down because of FX. I'm guessing that's more on the maintenance side. And if so, what would you \u2013 if things don't change between now and next year, what would you anticipate for CapEx to be next year?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. So, when I say that around management actions, we're taking a very holistic look across our entire spend rate, not just what hits the P&L, but also what hits the balance sheet. And maintenance is part of it, small growth CapEx, so that could be transportation assets, storage assets. In light of sort of the current environment we're in, we need to be very, very prudent on how we allocate capital and not just related to big projects, but to small capital expenditures as well.","So, we've got fairly large efforts under way to manage that. And when looking forward on CapEx, clearly we signed two large growth projects, so we're going to need to do some up-front spending for equipment ordering on that. And then in about a year or two, we'll start getting some on-the-ground expenses related to them.","But I'd say the number from a large perspective is going to be contingent on how many large capital projects we announce here. The kind of management actions we're taking could be a couple hundred million here or there on what we'll call the smaller growth and maintenance aspect. So, at this point, I'd still see it in this range of kind of $1.5 billion to $2 billion depending on where the large project timing spend is.","Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you. Very helpful.","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.","Ryan L. Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. This is Ryan Berney on for Bob. Just had a quick question on the updated guidance, you talked about kind of having an incremental $0.05 to $0.15 range from the impact of the lower oil and metals. And I was wondering if you could maybe give a little bit of a breakout, kind of between the two and what the scenario for the low-end versus the high-end looks like to you through the rest of the year?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure, Ryan. I would say, high level of the $0.05 to $0.15 range, probably two-thirds I would attribute to metals. And that's mostly U.S. related and how I would quantify the U.S. piece is, there's really two components in my mind that are impacting that. The first is the lower sales for tubular goods, and that's being impacted by the significant drop in energy. So that's \u2013 tubular goods going in upstream, midstream.","And the second piece, which is frankly to me almost seems like a bigger piece right now, is the U.S. dollar impact. So as you've probably seen, imports of steel is up 20% to 30% in the U.S. In fact, I believe a third of the current steel that's being used in the U.S. is imported. So that's creating some pressure on production in the U.S., and that's also impacting some of the volumes from the customer side.","The one-third that's energy, while we did anticipate some of the, what I'll call direct upstream impact, which would be our nitrogen going downhole for fracturing. The piece that this more ties into is the secondary impact on manufacturing, metfab and some of the other ancillary industries that were supporting this very broad-based energy across the United States. And we're seeing that slowing in both our package and merchant businesses. So that's how I'd quantify, kind of the other third. But that's just a rough split right now.","Ryan L. Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks. Very helpful. And then just kind of a follow-up on that, on that metals piece, it sounds like the imports issue is a big piece in the North American weakness. And do you get the sense that you're not going to be able to make that up kind of in other parts of the world? I know you called out the metals weakness, I think, in each of the geographic segments.","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, it depends obviously where it's coming from. And we are seeing some strength in Canada. Some of these imports are coming from Turkey, which we're not present in. So it just depends on what part of the world is importing. We are seeing some strength in India. We're seeing some strength in Canada. And we'll need to see out here in the next few months.","Ryan L. Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison from Global Hunter Securities. Your question, please.","Mike J. Harrison - Global Hunter Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning, Mike.","Mike J. Harrison - Global Hunter Securities LLC","Matt, I was hoping you could talk about your competitive advantages and disadvantages in the Gulf Coast hydrogen market and your capabilities once the expansion is complete in 2017.","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. So we have the strongest hydrogen network when you take the access of pipeline plus the hydrogen storage cavern, and we have a very strong blend of both on purpose hydrogen production and byproduct hydrogen production. So we'll now be extending that from Texas City down to Freeport, which will give us additional opportunities all along that pipeline to be able to branch off for future projects both for sources and for sinks of hydrogen.","And on the atmospheric side, as you know, we also have a very strong atmospheric network extending throughout the Gulf, and that will also be extended. So we'll be able to bring the full complementary process in atmospheric gases with a very strong backup network and ability to deliver very high-pressure, high-quality product at very short swings and intervals that are needed by our customer base.","So that gives a very strong and unique advantage, and we'll be able to continue to branch off this network for other opportunities between that whole Texas City and Freeport corridor.","Mike J. Harrison - Global Hunter Securities LLC","All right and turning to Brazil, kind of a series of questions. In your mind, has the economy there hit bottom? Can you maybe talk about what trends you've been seeing in the manufacturing and metals markets since Carnival got over with, and we got back to work? And maybe just give us your thoughts on the political situation. I know a lot of us thought that the elections would give us some closure and maybe some stability no matter who won. Now we have some continued issues, so to speak.","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. So I would say there's a whole bunch of interrelated issues going on in Brazil, and frankly, I don't know if it's hit the bottom. We'll see. It definitely feels pretty low right now. The negative 7% was pretty steep here for this quarter. But when I look at some of the factors that are driving the headwinds, I think some have improved, and some are kind of still at the same level. So, for instance, if you start with the energy, there were serious issues around the hydroelectric production. There was a very, very minimal amount of rainfall, and that was putting a lot of stress on the government balance sheets as they were subsidizing. Now those subsidies are starting to roll off. There's a bit of inflation in that market, but they have gotten some rains. They've seen a lot of less consumption of electricity in the industrial sector, frankly, given the low production environment. So, that situation seems to be working its way out, which was one of the headwinds. It's still not out of the woods yet, but that aspect seems to be working its way through.","Another issue, as you know, that came right after the election, was the entire Petrobras scandal. That has put a renewed headwind on activity not just around Petrobras, and I would say the overall confidence in the environment. But Petrobras is a very large consumer of goods across the whole country. So, this has had a knock-off effect on their suppliers and the local economies they work in.","So, that's been a bit of a drag. Now that they seem to be getting some progress, they are working to get out their financial statements. And the more that gets resolved, I think that will help rebuild some of the confidence, and we can get maybe back to some production. But other than that, volumes are still weak on anything that's industrial, anything that's manufacturing. Auto is very weak, noncyclicals are still doing well, food and beverage and healthcare.","So, we're \u2013 as I mentioned before, below take or pay on a handful of steel mills, so it won't get worse in those steel mills. And if we can see any amount of growth here, it will be quite accretive, but we're not going to bank on the growth, hence why we're making sure we keep our cost in line. And we're definitely raising price to stay ahead of this inflation.","And remember, that price will keep. So, the currencies will recover at some point. In fact, they had been recovering from the sort of low of 3.3 BRL\/USD, it's now in the low 2.9's BRL\/USD. But this price we will keep. And we just have to get ahead of it, and that's what we're looking at. So, I'm not going to bank on a recovery, but if it does happen, it will be quite accretive for us.","Mike J. Harrison - Global Hunter Securities LLC","All right. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Sheehan from SunTrust Robinson. Your question, please.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thanks for taking my question. With respect to your uses of cash, you've guided your CapEx budget a little bit lower here. And I'm just wondering about share buyback intentions going forward. Do you expect to maintain this pace of buybacks that you had in the first quarter or should it be a little bit higher?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, James, as I can keep making more cash freed up from my free cash flow, I'll use that for buybacks. So while I'm \u2013 we did lever up a bit this quarter, but first quarter is our weakest cash flow quarter in general just based on timing of tax payments and other payments. But I'm looking for the full year to keep my debt roughly consistent on a net debt basis. So, what that means is every dollar that I'm able to get back from either working capital or CapEx, or out of operating cash flow in general, I will use for buybacks.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Very good. And secondly, on your merchant utilization rates, I think you did mention the North America region. Could you also fill us in on utilization rates in the other regions, and your outlook on those for the rest of the year?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure, so as Kelcey had mentioned, U.S. low-80%s, and argon, we're still seeing fairly tight at mid-90%s, moving to South America, we're about mid-80%s which may seem somewhat surprising given the conditions down there. But you need to remember that the merchant liquids tend to go into a lot of the non-cyclical pieces of business and they're doing well. So while the on-site volumes are quite challenged in Brazil, the merchant business is still doing fairly well.","When you move to Europe, on average, we're low-70%s. We're seeing a little bit of improvement in the south. North is fairly stable, but more weakness in areas, especially Scandinavia. That's having some economic impact from low oil.","And when you go to Asia, we're around mid-70%s. Korea is still doing quite well, I'd say mid-80%s. We did add some capacity to India, so that's getting absorbed, so they are stepped down in probably the low 70%s. And China is in that low-70%s area as well, as Chinese New Year tends to be, during this quarter, a slower point on merchant consumption. So, that's kind of around the world. We've got plenty of capacity to sell more molecules when the demand comes. We're clearly not looking to add any more merchant capacity. But this is how we're operating right now around the world.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thank you very much.","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Manthey from Robert W. Baird. Your question, please.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good morning. Matt, when you look at the list of available productivity enhancement programs at the company, are the opportunities today still as plentiful and meaningful as in the past? Or after many, many years of excellence in productivity enhancement, is it hard to find significant business functions that are run sub-optimally today?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think there's \u2013 David, there's always opportunities. It's just the opportunity set sometimes will shift with what's going on in our end markets that we serve. So, for example, the main elements of productivity, if you sort of put them in buckets, you'll have efficiency of use of our input cost, so that could be natural gas, that could be power. You'll have efficiency in our distribution through our logistics efforts, so that's more efficient routings, saving things like diesel fuel, hours of drivers, and then you'll have just your general what I'll call overhead costs, the people and their associated costs to maintain the businesses.","So, when you see challenged environments like this in lower energy costs, you may not have as many opportunities to go after the low-energy cost side simply because the return on those projects become less, right? The capital you put in, the returns are not as great at low energy. However, you see strong opportunities in both the overhead as well as the distribution cost because as our merchant routings change with demand, we need to make sure we're constantly optimizing them to be able to save the most money.","So, I would say they don't go down as much as you think. They just shift, and our focus shifts. And another big area for opportunity, frankly, is going back to all of our suppliers and taking advantage of this low-commodity world. We buy commodities, too, whether it's steel for our plants or whether it's other type things that we use in our production processes. We go back across our whole supplier chain, and we also go to try and get productivity initiatives around the procurement. So, they still exist. You're seeing them in our results. You're seeing our margins expand, and I'm not concerned that the opportunity set is dwindling in this environment.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Understood.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Juan Pelaez, Director of Investor Relations. Sir you may begin.","Juan Pelaez - Praxair, Inc.","Thanks, Terrence. Good morning, and thank you for attending our Second Quarter Earnings Call and Webcast. I'm joined this morning by Matt White, Senior Vice President Chief Financial Officer; and Kelcey Hoyt, Vice President and Controller.","Today's presentation materials are available on our website at praxair.com in the investor section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on page two of the slides and note that it applies to all of the statements made during this teleconference. In addition, please note that year-over-year and sequential comparisons exclude first and second quarter transaction costs related to the potential merger with Linde. The reconciliations to the U.S. GAAP reported numbers are in the appendix of this presentation and press release. Matt and I will now review Praxair's second-quarter results including the current business environment and earnings guidance. We'll then be available to answer questions.","I'd like now to turn the call over to Matt.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Thanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Overall, we had a solid second quarter as sales grew mid-single digit and operating margins sequentially improved. Furthermore, we had another strong operating cash flow result at 25% of sales, which enabled almost $400 million of free cash flow, up 8% from prior year.","In addition to the financial performance, we continued to deliver on our core strategy. The combination of project startups in Asia and North America, coupled with initiatives to expand in resilient markets, has improved growth prospects under any economic scenario. And despite these recent project startups, we largely maintained the project backlog value with a new win in the U.S. Gulf Coast supplying a globally recognized petrochemical producer.","While the entire Praxair team maintained their focus executing on these initiatives, we also made significant progress toward the merger with Linde. In June, we executed a definitive business combination agreement which represents a significant step toward the combination of the two companies. I'll provide a few more details on the proposed merger later. But first I'd like to offer a brief update of global trends, which can be found on slide four.","North American organic growth of 4% was split between price and volume. All end markets increased with particular strength in electronics, manufacturing, chemicals and metals. Our U.S. packaged gas business has lapsed some of the more difficult prior-year comparisons as gas sales growth was positive each month and hard goods were roughly flat. While we haven't seen any material increase in production activity supporting the elevated expectations, there has been a slow and steady improvement across most industries.","Two areas where we are cautious heading into the third quarter are metals and automotive end markets. While we don't have much direct exposure to OEM or Tier 1 automotive producers, lower vehicle production would negatively affect steel and general manufacturing. So we've incorporated this view into the outlook. However, the U.S. Gulf Coast project bidding activity continues to be a bright spot for future growth. We signed another large project with a petrochemical plant during the second quarter and we feel quite confident in our ability to secure additional new business.","South America, specifically Brazil, continues to be a headwind to consolidated results. However, the level of exposure is dropping as the total segment revenues now only comprise 13% of global sales, down from last quarter and significantly down from prior years. We have started to lap some of our stronger pricing efforts and project startups so the anemic underlying volume trends, especially in manufacturing, are becoming more pronounced in the segment results. And even though the fundamental economic situation is slightly improving through fiscal and monetary efforts, the political uncertainty is keeping most industrial activity on the sidelines. Frankly, I don't expect much economic improvement in South America for the remainder of this year.","Europe, like North America, is steadily improving and experiencing growth in most end markets, especially electronics, chemicals and food and beverage. The CO2 acquisition is fully integrated and meeting or exceeding our key investment requirements. In fact, we're identifying additional areas to further expand our network, such as dry ice for food delivery, carbonation for residential sparkling water and specific food processing techniques.","Asia has been our fastest growing region for both sales and profit. The 11% organic sales growth is primarily driven by a combination of project startups and increased demand across chemicals, electronics and metals end markets. China, Korea and India are all supporting the volume trends and we experienced overall higher merchant pricing for the first time in several quarters.","In addition, the cost actions we took over the last two years have helped enable a healthy margin expansion with the volume growth. While these strong volume trends have continued into the month of July, it remains to be seen how sustainable they are for certain end markets.","Now before Juan walks through more detail on the quarter, I'd like to use the next two slides to explain the background behind a new metric we will disclose as part of our earnings presentation going forward. We believe this metric better captures the valuation in our industry and provides additional information to help our investors.","Slide Five provides a simple view of three different valuation techniques comparing an average of publicly traded industrial gas companies versus the S&P 500 and the S&P 500 Materials Indices. The upper left graph shows the traditional price to adjusted earnings ratio that is often used to compare valuation across industries.","From my perspective, there are two challenges to this metric. First, the extensive use of different non-GAAP earnings has made comparability across companies and industries quite challenging. Second, the IG industry has a large amount of noncash depreciation which has a negative impact on book earnings. Therefore, a P to E ratio by nature would penalize companies with significant D&A versus those that don't have as much.","Based on the traditional P to E ratio, IG companies appear to be trading at a premium to market which may attempt to compensate for the noncash D&A impact to earnings. However, when using price to cash ratios, the story becomes quite different. IG companies trade at a noticeable discount to the market when using price to operating cash flow. Operating cash flow is not affected by the use of non-GAAP metrics since it cannot be adjusted under U.S. GAAP, which improves comparability.","Now one could view \u2013 one view could be that the metric doesn't account for higher investing cash flows for capital-intensive companies like industrial gas players. So to account for CapEx impact, price to free cash flow is also represented in the upper right. Whether using price to operating cash flow or price to free cash flow, industrial gas companies actually appear to be trading flat to below relative index valuations. So from this view, CapEx becomes a more important aspect since it appears the capital intensity of this industry is resulting in a discount to alternative investments on a price to cash flow basis. But it's important to note that not all CapEx is created equally.","Slide six provides a simple comparison of types of CapEx between industrial gas companies and most other industries. Both spend CapEx toward growth initiatives or maintenance and other efforts. The growth initiatives are subject to volumes of customers or the general pricing or demand of the underlying products. For our industry, that represents growth capital to buy new tanks, cylinders, trailers or other similar items that vary with underlying growth prospects.","However, IG companies also have something that we called secured or contractual long-term growth. This represents CapEx spent specifically for a long-term on-site contract that has contractual fixed payments. These projects are specifically identified and stand on their own merit. The returns are much less affected by economic or demand cycles. Praxair represents these secured growth projects through the project backlog.","Over the years, investors have asked us to separate out the project backlog CapEx to better capture the value of our company. So starting today, we'll disclose CapEx in two parts. Backlog CapEx and base CapEx. Backlog CapEx represents spend, specifically in support of our project backlog. Base CapEx will represent all other CapEx including maintenance, safety, smaller growth efforts, cost reduction and other.","Furthermore, we'll start to report a metric called available operating cash flow which simply represents operating cash flow less the base CapEx. It's a form of free cash flow that excludes CapEx spent for backlog projects where we would have more confidence in their returns and growth impact. Similar to how free cash flow excludes acquisitions that are immediately accretive upon close, so too does AOCF exclude backlog projects that would be immediately accretive upon startup.","In summary, while we recognize there are many valuation methodologies traditional P to E ratios may not be the best way to judge relative valuation of the industrial gas industry. We believe operating cash flow is superior given the ability to easily compare across companies and industries without the problems of accounting differences or non-GAAP adjustments. And while the IG industry is capital-intensive, the nature of that CapEx spend is quite different from most other industries and should be accounted for accordingly.","I'd now like to hand it to off to Juan to review the second-quarter results.","Juan Pelaez - Praxair, Inc.","Thanks, Matt. Please turn to Slide Seven in our presentation for our consolidated results. Overall sales were $2.8 billion, 6% above the prior year, primarily due to 3% volume growth. Sales to all end markets were higher with chemicals, metals, electronics and our resilient end markets being the strongest growth drivers versus last year. Project contributions, including our new startups in China, Korea and Canada represented over one-third of the volume growth. Price attainment was 1% versus prior year and was achieved in all our geographic segments the first time since 2014.","Higher cost pass-through, mostly driven by higher natural gas prices passed through to hydrogen customers, increased sales by 2% but reduced operating margin by 50 basis points. Sequentially, volumes were up 3% versus the first quarter, mainly driven by food and beverage primarily in North America and Europe due to seasonality and electronics and metals largely in North America and Asia.","By operating segment, North America sales increased 7% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Excluding cost pass-through and currency, sales were up 4% above the prior year quarter mainly due to 2% higher volume in all three distribution modes and 2% higher pricing. The business achieved this price improvement in the U.S, Mexico and Canada in both the merchant and package business.","Sequentially, sales grew 3% driven by food and beverage, electronics, energy and chemicals end markets. In Europe, sales grew 8% year-over-year and sequentially. Year-over-year 4% growth was driven by higher volumes and 5% driven by the acquisition of a carbon dioxide business, largely serving the food and beverage market. We acquired the CO2 business in June 2016. So for future quarters, any variance will be recorded as volume.","Volumes grew in all the countries we operate but grew the largest in Spain and in Italy. By end markets, sales growth was mainly driven by food and beverage, electronics, chemicals and continued project contribution. Sequentially, volume increased 5%, primarily driven by sales to the food and beverage end market due to the seasonality. Year-over-year price attainment was 1%.","South America sales grew 4% year-over-year mainly driven by 6% currency tailwind. Price attainment was 1% as we continue to see low inflation in Brazil. In fact, the official June inflation rate of 3% was their lowest reading in a decade. Year-over-year volumes were down 4% with the largest impact in manufacturing which was down 15% year-over-year partially offset by project contribution and growth in the health care end market.","Sequentially, excluding currency, sales grew 3% from a combination of seasonal volume in the health care end market, price and cost pass-through. Asia sales of $422 million were 7% above prior-year and margins expanded 200 basis points through productivity and healthy volume growth. Excluding a prior year net divestiture, sales grew 11% driven by higher volumes in China, India and Korea and pricing of 1%.","Volume growth came from new project startups in China and Korea and strong growth in merchant liquids. Korea volumes were 21% above prior year due to project startups and organic growth. The electronics market, both for memory and displays continues to be strong as demand for applications such as automotive, servers, mobile devices and higher-quality display is currently robust.","AMOLED for display, 3D NAND and DRAM for memory are enjoying a good growth trajectory and expect volumes to be healthy for remainder of the year. We supply on-site nitrogen, bulk gases and a wide range of specialty gases like Xenon and Neon for these applications.","Surface technology sales were up 2% year over year and 1% sequentially, mostly driven by growth in aerospace coating volumes. Our project backlog is currently $1.4 billion slightly below first quarter as we started up projects in Canada, U.S, China and Korea. Partially offset by a new win to a large petrochemical customer in the U.S. Gulf Coast. As of the second quarter, more than 80% of our project backlog is in the U.S. Gulf Coast.","Adjusted operating profit of $619 million was up 5% from the prior-year period, driven by higher volumes, price and flat fixed cost. Operating margin was 21.8% and EBITDA margins was 32.5%. Earnings-per-share of $1.46 was up 5% versus prior-year quarter.","As previously described by Matt, we are disclosing our base CapEx which represents our total CapEx minus our backlog CapEx. You can also see on the slide the new financial metric, available operating cash flow, which increased 2% year-over-year driven mainly by lower base CapEx. For the past couple of years, base CapEx has averaged in the low $200 million range and differences between the quarters are largely driven by timing of maintenance, small growth and other investments.","Now I will turn the call back to Matt to discuss our earnings guidance","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Before I jump into guidance, I'd like to give a brief update on the proposed merger with Linde. There are three basic phases required for the success of this merger. The first phase requires an agreed-upon framework of the new company structure, governance, synergies and operating rhythm. The second phase requires approval from regulators and shareholders. And the third phase requires post-closing execution of the overall integration plan in coordination with other key stakeholders, such as employees and customers.","All three phases impact various stakeholders and have unique risks throughout the process. As you all know, last month we completed the first phase with the execution of the definitive business combination agreement. Both management teams and boards have agreed upon the framework of the new company and those details can be found in our S-4 filing and investor presentations.","We are currently in the second phase. The second phase goes from the definitive agreement until merger close. There are three primary areas of focus in this phase. Regulatory approval with associated remedies, shareholder approval and planning work around integration. We expect to file in approximately two dozen jurisdictions and work is well underway. Furthermore, we have a significant amount of unsolicited interest in potential asset divestitures. A formal process is being developed which will be communicated to prospective buyers in the coming months. The shareholder process has two distinct components. The Praxair shareholder approval and the Linde exchange offer. We must achieve a favorable vote from Praxair shareholders holding at least a majority of outstanding shares. A special shareholder's meeting is expected to be held in the fall.","For Linde shareholders, 75% of all outstanding shares must be tendered in the exchange offer. This is a very structured process run under German BaFin regulations which requires a formal exchange offer document to be published in the next few weeks followed by a several week window for tendering. More information will be disclosed as we roll this out.","Finally, we are able to perform planning activities around integration but we cannot undertake any actual integration activities until closing since we remain competitors. I would anticipate the planning activities to accelerate as we get closer to the ultimate close date which we expect to occur in the second half of 2018.","The third phase would formally kickoff at close. All levels of the organization will be clearly defined and communicated by this stage. We will actively execute the integration plan including establishing the culture and attaining stated synergies. Formal communication to employees, customers and other key stakeholders will be undertaken at a more granular level to assist in the transition.","So based on this, our current focus is achieving both shareholder and regulatory approvals while performing limited integration planning. We intend to provide more formal updates at each important milestone. But until then, you can find information on the deal website which is linked to both company's main websites.","I'd like to wrap it up with guidance on Slide Eight. Third quarter guidance is estimated to be between $1.40 and $1.46. We are essentially carrying this range into the fourth quarter as well, resulting in a new full year guidance range of $5.63 to $5.75. Clearly, EPS results have exceeded our guidance range for the last two quarters as underlying volumes and FX rates have both been better than anticipated. So you might question that this range is too conservative.","From my perspective, if current spot FX rates hold and volumes continue at the levels of the second quarter, we'd be at the upper end of these ranges especially given the fourth quarter project contribution. However, uncertainty in South America coupled with concerns on both metals and automotive in North America, are tempering the outlook. Therefore, we feel it's prudent to maintain the current midpoint estimate until we have better visibility on these trends. But rest assured that our employees are focused and actively engaged to deliver shareholder value.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Stephen Byrne from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks. Matt, I was wondering how many employees that Praxair has that operate out of U.S. hospitals and that function to maintain the gas systems in those hospitals? Do you see an opportunity for these employees to help drive growth in a Lincare business assuming that the merger goes through?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Well, Steve, let me just start with healthcare for us as a whole is about 8% of our global sales. And as you probably know, there are two basic elements of healthcare. There's what's called institutional, the hospitals primarily. And then there's what's called homecare, which is where you will service the house on things from either concentrators for COPD or you'll have retail outlets for things like sleep apnea. So we do both of those everywhere in the world with the exception of the U.S. where we only do the institutional.","As you probably know, we exited the U.S. home care business back around 2011. We divested that business. So we haven't been as close to the trends in the U.S. over the last few years but I would say that we know the business around the world. It is a good business when we have the right payer structure and you have the right infrastructure. So as far as when we merge, that's just something that will be evaluated in the portfolio as we would in any business that we do today and that Linde does today as well. But Lincare is clearly best-in-class in the U.S. They're the strongest performer and they have a very strong footprint.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And if I could just jump to a hydrogen question, you've locked up the offtake of the hydrogen from the first of what's going to be several ethylene crackers. Just wondering whether there's a longer-term opportunity for you to secure other supply of hydrogen or is all that going to be consumed internally by those producers?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","So, Steve, we've actually been securing by-product hydrogen sources for quite some time whether it be chlor-alkali or ethylene cracker or PDH units. So this is something that's been part of our hydrogen strategy since the inception one or two decades ago. So from that perspective, it's just part of the normal course of business for us. Clearly the more pipelines you have, the more infrastructure you have and you get the right blend of on-purpose production and then by-product. That's something we like.","The cavern gives us an extra element to be able to store any by-product hydrogen if we need to take it without delivering it to the customer. So we continue to evaluate that with each cracker that comes on. We're going to look at the location, we're going to look at our needs and we'll make a balanced decision based on that. So it's not something that's new, but clearly it's something we continue to look at.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mike Sison from KeyBank. Your line is open.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey. Nice quarter there. In terms of North America encouraged to see volumes continue to pick up a little bit. What do you think the cadence is as we head into the second half of the year?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","So as we laid out in the outlook, the two areas where we have a little bit of concern would be automotive and the knockoff that would have in general manufacturing. So think more Tier 2, Tier 3 as it relates to the packaged gas business and then the general metal production. The flat steel production, the last numbers I saw something in the neighborhood of 20% plus of steel production in the U.S. goes into the automotive industry. So from that perspective, we are taking a bit of a cautious outlook for the next two quarters and we're assuming some step down in volumes.","But in other areas, it's been quite good. Downstream energy has been very strong. Chemicals has been very strong. We've seen good food and beverage growth in North America. We've had some good pricing at 2%, some of the strongest pricing we've seen in a while. And a lot of startups here in the fourth quarter that are all primarily in North America that will help further contribute. So I'd say I feel pretty good.","And then on the upstream oil, it's down at such low levels that we are seeing some activity which is good but I'm not expecting it to get anywhere near levels that we saw several years ago but any incremental growth there is positive as we've pretty much lapped a lot of the difficult comps. So in a nutshell, I'd say we feel pretty good about really every market with the exception of potentially manufacturing and metals just given the uncertainty around the automotive impact.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then I like Slide Five there and certainly wouldn't disagree with your analysis. But just curious, when you think about having to divest some of these projects, the businesses with the Linde transaction, does it imply that you might have to give somebody a bargain?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Well, it's going to be a function of supply and demand and as I stated in the prepared remarks, there's a significant amount of demand. Also, as you know, that money is still not that expensive today and some of the benchmark transactions that have occurred in this industry, I think the multiples have been fairly healthy. So it remains to be seen, but I would say from what we've seen at this point, it's lining up to be a good opportunity if divestitures are required in certain regions.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Christopher Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you. You hit on your cautious stance on metals and manufacturing in the U.S. but it appears you're slightly more optimistic and seeing better activity in Asia. Can you just quickly comment on the key end markets and consequent drivers of your business that you're looking at for the second half of 2017 and into 2018 as well as any additional color on project bidding activity? Thank you.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Sure. Do you want specific focus on Asia in terms of the market activity?","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Sure, yes.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Okay. So clearly strong growth in Asia. The three markets we're seeing on a year-over-year basis the greatest growth, are chemicals, electronics and metals. I'd say they're kind of a third, a third, a third in terms of contribution towards that and it's really across India, China and Korea. Thailand, right now, is a little weaker due to natural gas vehicles but the other three countries are doing quite well. Metals is really just a function of who we supply, the Tier 1, the strongest metals competitors in that industry in China and they're running quite well. I think part of it is part of the Silk Road Initiative. They're producing more metals for the automotive industry. So we are seeing them run harder and that's worked out quite well.","On the chemicals, it's a combination of some startups. We had a few startups in the chemical industry and were also seeing a lot of our chemical producers also run quite strong, part in support of the infrastructure but also just some of the other consumer demands. And then electronics is an area that's really growing in China. We actually announced some wins that we've had in that space. You are seeing some very large investments there around the electronics space primarily end consumer electronics. But this is something we're also cautious on as well in terms of new project opportunities.","So that kind of, I guess, segues into your next question which is project opportunities we're seeing. And one is Asia electronics. There are a lot of opportunities out there and we're being selective. We want to make sure we partner with the right customers and that's no different than how we approach every project opportunity but there are lots of investments being made right now in Asia in the electronics space.","Chemicals continues to be good and that's primarily Asia and the U.S. The U.S. Gulf Coast, as we had mentioned in prepared remarks, we're still seeing more opportunities even after this additional win that we secured here in the second quarter and its continuation of further down the chemical chain as more people are taking advantage of the low-cost feedstock in the U.S, they just need more industrial gases. So that's something that we continue to feel quite good about as far as the project opportunities.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Sure. And just a follow up on that. Within LatAm it's zero surprise that IP is still weak but are there any other notable more granular trends? Anything manufacturing signs there versus previous quarters or any views on how well healthcare will continue to grow? Just anything outside of IP that's kind of changing on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Thank you.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Sure. Food is slowing a little. Healthcare continues to perform well. I think on the macro front, they are making positive traction. I mean they're getting some legislation to help on labor reform which I think was needed in Brazil. They're trying to address pension reform which is doubtful whether or not they'll make progress on that. They lowered SELIC again here I think another hundred basis points and inflation is under control. Those are all, I think, good things when you're trying to recover in an economy.","The problem is it's being completely overshadowed by the political situation. The Operation Car Wash and what they're doing, while I think that has good long-term ramifications, it's just creating a significant amount of uncertainty right now. And as I mentioned, it's just keeping investments on the sidelines. So we'll have to see. Elections are next year and I think it's just going to be kind of news-driven type events in Brazil for a while and that will probably keep long-term investments on hold. But I think once there's more clarity around the elections, that might help because I'd say from the fiscal and monetary basis, they seem to be doing the right things.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you for the color.","Operator","And our next question comes from Laurence Alexander from Jeffries. Your line is open.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. Two questions. First, looking at the backlog map, can you reconcile the dispersion of opportunities that you see particularly with plenty of electronics opportunities in Asia and the lack of large projects in the backlog after 2017? Is it an issue around customers pushing back on your criteria? Or is it \u2013 or do you worry about the sales force getting stale or getting more disconnected with the marketplace if they are not signing contracts with really some frequency? Second question is just on the, you know, given the strategy slide and the acceleration in 2017, 2018 in the emerging markets and the oil and gas markets, how do you see \u2013 how much of a \u2013 I guess what would you see as Plan B for that if that doesn't materialize?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","I'm sorry. Repeat the second one again? Plan B if what doesn't materialize?","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","If we end up in a steady slow growth, emerging markets remain choppy, Oil & Gas doesn't recover so basically the growth is mostly focused on U.S. Gulf Coast and China.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Basically a repeat of the last two to three years?","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Right.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Okay. So we'll start on the backlog. Nothing really to the sales force. I think if you look at the backlog, we do have projects that extend well beyond 2017. A lot of them are U.S. Gulf Coast. We're probably about 80% right now of our backlog is associated with the U.S. Gulf Coast. What we're seeing in the electronics in Asia is actually something more within the last year. So those are projects being bid on, being worked on. They are things that would be announced more over the next 12 months.","So when I talk about trends we're seeing, it doesn't necessarily mean things that are signed in the backlog, it's more of things that are creating a lot of requests, that people are asking for bids and that they want to have plants or sale of gas contracts to be able to supply their assets. So that I think explains that point.","As far as plan B, we've laid out our strategy and as you probably recall, our strategy essentially assumes no real material improvement in the economy. We laid out to 2018 the type of things that we need to do in this environment and it includes everything from the price and cost management that we're doing, to some of the acquisitions that we've done, to executing on our backlog and really a focus on these more resilient markets that, as you know, are more insulated from a commodity or industrial cycles.","And you look at the kind of growth trends in those markets for us, whether it's health care, whether it's food and beverage or some of the more consumer related cycles, which are different than the industrial cycles like electronics and even in aerospace. We've had a lot of good growth there and we continue to increase those portions of our portfolio. So from my perspective, if the industrial and commodity recovers, that's great. We're well-positioned to enjoy that. If it doesn't that's why we have the strategy we have and from that perspective, I think we're executing on it quite well.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Your line is open.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes. Hi. Good morning, Matt.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Good morning.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I have another question on the backlog. 80% is in North America does that mean that you're winning higher than your share in North America? And if I remember a few years ago about half the backlog was in emerging markets. So what is holding emerging markets back and when do you see that recovery coming through?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Okay. So on North America, I'd say we have a strong footprint. We have a strong team and that is by far the largest opportunity set in the world. So I'd say what's happening there is given our resources and our positioning and what's going on there, we are winning a good share and they tend to be large projects. So the dollars are big. I mean, most of these projects we've been winning are a combination of both atmospheric and processed gases. So it could be syngas coupled with oxygen. You have nitrogen. And so it's large investments and they tend to take up a disproportionate amount of our capital spend. So I just think it's the combination of the activity there, our presence and position and density and just the sheer size of the projects we're undertaking.","As far as, I will just go to the BRIC term, right? The Brazil, Russia, India, China from the emerging market opportunity. I mean, clearly, Brazil. We've had a lot of conversations on that. Not a lot of investment. Russia challenges, clearly, and so not a significant amount of investments. We had some and then you're kind of left with India and China.","In China we had a big, big wave of the infrastructure buildout and that was things like metals and glass and cement and others. There was a second, I'll call it, wave in the chemical space. A lot of the coal to everything and we were selective in that process and then now you're seeing, I'd say, more consumer electronics kind of downstream refining phase. And similarly, we're being selective. so we have something like $1.4 billion in our backlog right now and then there's some others that we're pursuing that we like. So clearly, there's been a reduction in the emerging market and a couple of countries are going to drive that. So that's been primarily the decline there and the decline in the investment cycle but we feel very good about the U.S. and we feel very good about the projects we're pursuing in other parts of the world, especially Asia.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you for that. And then a quick question on packaged gasses. Where you are supplying mid to small size businesses, how is the health of that segment? And in hard goods? You always said that this tends to be a leading indicator. What are you seeing there? Thank you very much.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Sure. So hard goods, if you look at the same store sales numbers in the second quarter, pretty much flat. Now that used to be down. You'd go back a couple quarters, we were down double-digit percent. So each successive quarter, our same-store sales numbers improved, but improved off a pretty low base. So we were flat which is better than last quarter and all the prior quarters going back at least a year to a year and a half. So that trend has been good.","We are seeing some people make some investments in equipment again which shows a little bit of optimism but for the most part people are still a little guarded, right? Until they have the orders in their hand, they're not going to make the investments. You've got to remember a lot of these small and mid-size manufacturers were burned pretty bad in the great recession. So I think that's still fresh in their minds.","Gas, rent and other is up for the quarter. Same-store sales up a low single digit percent. So that's a trend that continues to do well. So I would say on a packaged North American basis in U.S. specifically, we feel pretty good about the trends. It's going in the right direction. We are lapping some easier comps but we feel good about where that's at and I would say Canada and Mexico continue to do quite well. I mean they're growing mid-single digit or better and have been. So that's also helping the North America numbers.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Roberts from UBS. Your line is open.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Matt, on the base CapEx versus backlog CapEx, can we assume that backlog CapEx is a very high percent of that so that it's roughly comparable to the way Air Products does its CapEx split?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Not even close, no. Ours is specifically for our backlog. That's it. So we include growth in the base CapEx. We're including tanks. We're including trailers. The challenge in this industry is other than your backlog how do you define growth? If you go and buy new tanks, is that growth or is that replacement maintenance? It depends how it's presented to you. It's all part of a pool of tanks that you're going to deploy at various needs. So from the way we're presenting this, the backlog CapEx ties directly to the backlog that you see. So our $1.4 billion backlog that we represented this quarter, this is the amount of CapEx we spent in this quarter in support of that number.","But we're clearly doing other growth projects that are not in the backlog. That are smaller. That are more around the merchant business. That might be associated with the package business. We have cost reduction projects we're doing that aren't necessarily considered maintenance. Any other type CapEx would be in that base CapEx number.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Is that a metric that you'll report for the new Linde post-merger and will we get any historicals for Praxair and Linde before the merger?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","I can't comment at this stage of what would be reported for the new company but we did provide some historicals on this in the backup information that we have on the press release tables but we will clearly be reporting it on a prospective basis to build a track record there for you.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi thanks very much. Sometimes when we examine price growth for industrial gas companies, it's a little bit difficult to know what's mix and what's true price. Given that your volumes are growing at a faster rate than they were last year, are the price trends genuinely more positive or are they the same as last year? Is there more of a price element or more of a mix element?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Sure, Jeff. And I agree with you, by the way. In the end, the numbers have to add to the sales change and when you get into price mix and volume, it's never always that clear and mix has to end up somewhere. So we attempt to put mix in with price and from my perspective, I always just like to look at what's going on in the margins to help sort of explain that. And when you look across North America, while margins declined 30 basis points year-over-year, we had 90 basis points of energy pass-through, primarily in natural gas in the HyCO business but excluding that, we're actually up. So you see the benefit of that price pulling through, or call it price mix, pulling through on the remainder of the business.","South America is the opposite effect, right? I mean, the volume that's falling through and that price mix is a drag on the margins right now and that's something we're actively working on. But in the rest of the world, Asia another example, right? Up 200 basis points year-over-year and a lot of that is some of the, not just volume but the price mix portion as well.","As you probably know, in our Qs, we do attempt to isolate this when we show the sales and OP variances by segment but I would say for the most part, we feel good that our price is falling through. From a mix perspective, we feel pretty good everywhere except South America right now, specifically Brazil. That's where it's the most challenging, given there's just a significant reduction in merchant sales, which tend to be a bit higher margin in that region and you're seeing it ex pass through, you're seeing our margins expand in all the other regions right now.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Mm-hmm. If you can close the merger with Linde, you'll go from being, I don't know, an $11 billion in itself company to a $25 billion or $26 billion company after divestitures. Industrial gas tends to be a regional business but you will be 2.5 times larger. What are the competitive strengths or the business strengths that come from being a much larger entity in a globally regional business, if there are any?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Well, to your point, Jeff, it's a local business, right? So clearly there's going to be different philosophies on what we'll call corporate and the overhead structure. And those, depending on what direction you take, may become a possible synergy and cost efficiency. But once you get through that and go down to the actual local structure, it's a matter of how you incent people. How the region is structured. Some regions can be structured more top-heavy, I'll call it. How you leverage the assets and make asset investments. If you have excess asset investments, that's going to create excessive depreciation that could be something that would create a challenge.","So, yes, it's a local business but on how you run it, the philosophy, how the overhead structure is established, these are things we do acquisitions today. I mean, these are things that we constantly come across and Linde as well. They've done acquisitions and they've synergized deals in the same token. So it's not something that's new in this industry but to your point it is local and you just have to be clear on how you're organized, how you're structured, and the things you want to spend money on and the things you don't want to spend money on.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Matt, on Slide 16 you detail sales by end markets. Electronics sales grew 13% year-over-year. Can you give a little more color as to what drove that acceleration versus the prior few quarters?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Sure, David. When you look at that number, about its roughly split half North America, half Asia. And in the Asia, within that, a good portion of it are some of the project startups we've done primarily in support of AMOLED.","As you probably know AMOLED is growing quite strong here on the display side and we're seeing lots of applications in support of that. In addition, on North America just our general processed gas business, we're just seeing a stronger pull from our customer base. And whether it's for lighting applications, like LED, or some of the display sides on AMOLED or OLED, we're seeing stronger volumes. So it's been a good run for us, but as you know, it's a cyclical business so we need to be cognizant of that. But right now, it's in a nice part of the cycle and as I mentioned earlier, in Asia we're seeing a lot more investments that potential customers are looking to make to further add capacity in this space. So that could be an opportunity for future growth associated with the backlog.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Very good. And just on \u2013 do you have merchant operating rates by region?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Yes, I do. So when you kind of break it down, and I'd start with saying not a lot of difference by region from what we said last time. And what I'll give here are primarily our LOX\/LIN rates on the liquefiers for utilization but I can give you some LAR where it makes sense. But U.S, we're running high 70%s almost 80% maybe a little around the 80% range. We continue to see good pull on the volume there and you see it in some of the growth rates.","South America is continues to decline, especially Argon, so we're down probably in the low 70s or even lower now when you bake in Argon just given the continued manufacturing challenges there. Most of the merchant we're seeing there is either going into the resilient markets like food, beverage and health care. Europe, probably mid 70%s right now. Argon has been stepping up but we did have a new asset that we started up there in the pipeline. So that's providing a few more molecules that will add some capacity. And then Asia, we're probably mid-80%s. We're seeing very strong utilizations in places like China and Korea. And India with some recent capacity, we're a little bit lower but that's an area where we're starting to see a strong pull on the capacity.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi thank you, and good morning. A couple of quick ones. One on the guidance, I appreciate the comments earlier. I wanted to make sure I understood. The high-end came down \u2013 I just wasn't clear why the high-end came down relative to the quality of the results year-to-date.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Yes. So we just want to be cognizant that between the metals and the automotive outlook, we are having a little bit of a downstep from what the run rates we were seeing in manufacturing. Now if that doesn't materialize, that could be something that could help us here.","But also, I'd say in Asia we ran very strong rates and we just want to be a little bit prudent about that looking forward. Now so far through July we've seen rates similar to the second quarter but those are the reasons that we wanted to tone that a little bit off the top end. But clearly if things continue on the Q2 trends and these FX rates hold that we're seeing today, that is something that could push us more to the upper end of that number.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then your return on capital improved, sequentially 10 basis points. I'm just curious if you have thoughts on whether that's finally bottomed out now after a couple of quarters at 12? And should we start to see some sequential improvement and maybe get back to where you were a couple years ago?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","That's our goal. As you know, in the short term, it's a more numerator sensitive metric and since we do a four-quarter trailing NOPAT and a five-quarter trailing average on the capital, we have to start lapping some of the difficult numbers. So as long as each new quarter, if you look at this quarter what we did in Q2 by replacing the one from a year ago, we improved. So as long as we can, each time we drop one of the tougher comp and replace it with a better number, that will bring the average up.","And it's really going to be numerator sensitive. So with the kind of numbers we're producing our goal is to keep getting this back up. And yes, our way we are incented on this and our goal is we need to get back to the kind of levels we're used to on this metric.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jim Sheehan from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is open.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","In Asia you had some pretty strong pricing and you gave a little bit of color on that, but I was hoping dig a little deeper. If you can talk about, is electronics really driving some of the price increase there? And so how sustainable is that pricing in Asia in the second half of 2017?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","That's what we are all trying to figure out I think. Asia, China we will start with China. And we've talked about it on many calls in the past. China is a bit of a unique market where you have a lot of structural supply issues on merchant liquid. And so it tends to be much more sensitive to the supply demand balance than almost anywhere else that we have in the world. And given the high rates that we're are seeing in China right now, it's giving us a good opportunity for some pricing.","It remains to be seen if they continue to draw those type volumes. As I mentioned earlier I think this Silk Road Initiative is sort of re-engaging a lot of the industrial assets to support the infrastructure that they want to put in. If that continues and you continue to see this pace, it could bode well for some pricing.","I think in China in general, you see in various industries are starting to discover pricing, so to speak. Just given the years of cost inflation that have occurred there. So I think if trends continue that should be able to help us, but it remains to be seen on the volume front. I think other parts of Asia have been pretty good and stable. China is the one that really drove this sort of change, because in the past it did drag down the results and now it was not in this quarter.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And our final question comes from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is Matt on for Kevin. Just wanted to talk a little about the valuation metrics. In the past, you've been somewhat skeptical on the alternative valuation metrics and this notion of distributable cash flow. You seem to be presenting CapEx a bit differently, but in theory it more or less appears to be a similar notion. So why have you chosen to change your tune and adopt this new metric?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Let's start with, we've been talking about for the last couple of years at least if not longer, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Those have been two metrics that have been part of almost every dialogue that we've had in any external form. So what this is, I will call it a slight twist on that by bifurcating CapEx. We're still starting with the same base operating cash flow, and that's an important distinction.","I think there have been requests of us in the past to use different methodologies and the challenges we've had is they are not comparable given some of the non-GAAP or GAAP differences amongst various companies and various industries.","Operating cash flow is an accounting figure, you can pull that from any accounting report of any company. So from that perspective the only change we're making is giving two pieces of our CapEx, and that's something that's been asked of us for quite some time. And yes, we were a little reluctant because we had concerns of defining certain maintenance growth. But in the method we've done it, it's from our perspective much cleaner because the CapEx on the backlog is in support of the number we've been supplying for well over a decade, and the remaining CapEx is just a combination of all other factors.","So this is how we've been looking internally at this for quite a long period of time. It's not new for us internally, but we are providing an extra layer of detail for the external analyst and investors just given the requests that they've had over the years.","Unknown Speaker","That's helpful and on North America just given the rebound we are seeing in packaged gas and hard goods. How should we think about that mix effect on EBIT margins in general for that business?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Well, when you exclude the pass-through, we've been increasing margins in North America, and I think that's just a function of as you get more merchant and more package it is accretive to the average margins. Package because you're getting more of a variable margin contribution, as long as you hold your fixed cost. And merchant tends to be accretive to the average OP margins. So you would get what we'd expect and what we are seeing. The challenge we had is natural gas year-over-year is up by almost 70% and that's creating a little bit of a pass-through of almost 4% on the segment. I'd expect to lap that in about a quarter or two, and then you should be able to see the more standard margins on a year-over-year comparison basis. But clearly they should be accretive and we're seeing that on the ground.","Unknown Speaker","And so just this potential lag at least in this match between customer demand and the economic expectations, and recent economic trends. Is that just a lag that typically happens with package gas? Or is there maybe something else at play?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Package tends, at least from my perspective, package tends to lag in general on any trend that goes on in the industrial cycle because they have much larger supply chains for customers that they supply. They tend to be further on in the process. So the on-site tends to be large commodity producers that have globally traded commodities, and they can turn on and off their production fairly quickly, and they have extremely high visibility into pricing, margins and inventory levels.","As you get further and further away from that base, I'll call it production, or commodity, then you start getting into manufacturing in support of that, and they have backlogs that could be three months, six months, nine months. So any shift that happens in some of the larger industrial players, the smaller and medium-sized manufacturers don't feel it until usually, sometimes several quarters. And we saw it in the great recession, we saw it in the recession in the early 2000's, late 1990s. And we saw it here in this most recent I'll call it industrial slowdown. So the trend has kind of continued to play out and we are starting to see the recovery as we expected in the U.S. package business.","Unknown Speaker","Thank you.","Juan Pelaez - Praxair, Inc.","Thank you again for participating in our Second Quarter Earnings Call.

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, July 26, 2018.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Juan Pelaez, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Juan Pelaez - Praxair, Inc.","Thanks, Ezra. Good morning. And thank you for attending our Second Quarter Earnings Call and webcast. I am joined this morning by Matt White, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Kelsey HOIT, Vice President and Controller. Today's presentation materials are available on our website at praxair.com in the Investor section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on page two of the slides, and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference. In addition, please note the year-over-year and sequential comparisons exclude transaction costs related to the potential merger with Linde.","The reconciliations to the U.S. GAAP reported numbers are in the Appendix to this presentation and the press release. Matt and I will now review Praxair's second quarter results, including the current business environment. We will then be available to answer questions.","Let me now turn the call over to Matt.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Thanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone. The strong momentum continued into the second quarter, as sales and EBITDA exceeded $3 billion and $1 billion, respectively. Organic sales growth of 7% is consistent with recent trends, and we successfully increased operating and EBITDA margins for the fifth consecutive quarter, as incremental volume growth and pricing actions more than offset the effects of cost inflation.","The culmination of these efforts led to a record EPS of $1.72. Furthermore, this was accomplished without significant use of capital, as net debt decreased $318 million this quarter, supporting a 13.6% return on capital, which is 150 basis points better than last year. The organization achieved this performance and captured incremental value through multiple initiatives, including price and cost management, prudent investments in the project backlog and a focused and disciplined capital allocation process owned by all employees. And we continued to position ourselves for future growth by winning three new on-site projects, increasing the project backlog to $1.7 billion of capital spend, all underpinned by high-quality customer contracts.","Overall, the economic landscape for industrial gases has remained quite positive and we anticipate a continuation of these trends, especially in North America and Asia, which are two of the best-performing regions. The North American segment, at 52% of sales, has steadily improved several quarters in a row, as U.S. industrial production rates have grown 3% to 4%. Approximately a year ago, we anticipated a recovery in the U.S. packaged gas market, which we have experienced with recent growth rates ranging from high-single to double-digits for both cylinder gases and hard goods. In fact, the manufacturing and industrial recovery in North America has supported increased gas consumption across all supply modes.","Chemicals, aerospace and manufacturing have been the fastest growing end markets due to a combination of large project start-ups and higher levels of demand. The metals end market has been steadily increasing as customer run rates improve, and the resilient end markets of food, beverage and health care continue to grow in line with demographic trends.","The North American energy market was softer versus prior year, as we experienced a few customer outages which have since returned to normal run rates. Pricing improvement of 2% is offsetting cost inflation, enabling operating margin to exceed 27%. Finally, we added another project to the backlog and are confident in our ability to win new on-site business opportunities, especially in the U.S. Gulf Coast. So in summary, North America remains a strong market and we anticipate these trends to continue.","Asia is the fastest growing segment, with sales and operating profit growth of 19% and 34%, respectively. Similar to North America, higher levels of industrial activity, coupled with cost inflation, have enabled price attainment and volume growth across every end market and supply mode. Metals, manufacturing and electronic end market improvements drove sales growth.","Bt we also experienced a substantial increase in the energy market with the start-up of our CNOOC project. The pricing improvement of 3% was mostly driven by China merchant pricing actions, as years of pent-up inflation is being passed through. Korea and India also have seen price improvements in line with inflation trends. Project backlog opportunities remain healthy as we signed two new projects supporting the chemical and electronic end markets.","The Europe segment, at 15% of sales, continues to demonstrate positive growth on a very stable base business. The 2% volume growth is consistent with prior quarter, as most end markets have been steadily improving, led by metals and manufacturing. But more importantly, the pricing improvement of 3% is a clear demonstration of the team efforts to recover cost and power inflation. Margins expanded 30 basis points from prior year, but this includes a 90 basis point headwind from higher cost pass-through. Therefore, underlying margins improved 120 basis points from pricing actions in excess of inflation.","Also, in the second quarter, we have supply disruptions from our crude CO2 suppliers, primarily due to unanticipated shutdowns of ammonia plants, which negatively affected margins from higher dislocation costs. The majority of our sources are back up and running, so we do not expect the same level of supply disruption for Q3.","As anticipated, the South American segment continues to lag the rest of the world due to sluggish economic conditions in Brazil. While volume levels grew 4% due to higher steel mill operating rates, the manufacturing end market was quite weak from a nationwide Brazilian trucker strike that contributed to a negative 7% year-over-year industrial production rate for the month of May. This goal and political concerns have created significant devaluations of the Argentine peso and Brazilian real, resulting in a 10% year-over-year currency headwind for the quarter. While conditions are expected to remain challenging for the foreseeable future, our team continues to run a quality business with 27% EBITDA margins and high cash generation.","The PST business posted good results, with year-over-year sales and operating profit growth of 14% and 24% respectively. You may recall last quarter, the ramp-up cost incurred to increase coater capacity in support of the aviation end market. Now we are selling from that new capacity while also seeing positive recovery in the energy and industrial end markets. We anticipate further growth as more capacity comes online to serve the large backlog of engine parts required for jet orders.","So, in summary, I'd say we are firing on four out of five cylinders. A strong performance across most segments more than offsets the weak South America. It's clear that all Praxair employees have maintained focus to deliver value and grow a high-quality business. But we have also made substantial progress toward the merger, which you can find on slide five.","The current focus of both organizations can be boiled down to two major areas, first, to obtain regulatory approvals including potential divestiture agreements and, second, to accelerate merger planning efforts. As you have seen from recent announcements, there have been a few key accomplishments on the regulatory front. At this stage, there are six remaining regulatory approvals required under the BCA as we recently received clearance in Mexico. Milestones are being completed as we work toward closing the transaction prior to the October 24 long-stop date.","In addition, Praxair and Linde each announced executed agreements to sell their respective European and Americas assets in support of ongoing regulatory negotiations. Now while the completion of these agreements does not assure approval from the relevant regulators, we continue to work constructively through the process. In parallel with Anti-trust efforts, we are conducting integration planning activities in order to prepare for the merger close date.","Since we are still competitors, we're unable to begin integration but we can develop detailed plans for day one readiness. Examples include plans for organization structure and talent selection, operating rhythm, IT systems, accounting filings and several other initiatives. As you can imagine with a merger of this size, there is a substantial amount of work and complexity, but we continue to have positive interactions between both companies as we move forward.","Similar to prior quarters, we are not in a position to provide any details on the process, so I appreciate your efforts to refrain from asking merger-related questions.","I'd now like to hand it back to Juan to review the second quarter results.","Juan Pelaez - Praxair, Inc.","Thanks, Matt. Please turn to slide six in our presentation for our consolidated results.","Sales of $3.1 billion were 8% higher than prior year and 2% higher than the first quarter. Year-over-year volume was the largest contributor with growth of 5%, of which 40% came from project start-ups and the balance from organic growth. Furthermore, the growth was broad-based, with every end market contributing, although metals, manufacturing, chemicals and electronics led the way.","Additionally, at 4% of our total sales, aerospace was another significant contributor to the overall growth, up 16% year-over-year. For the past six quarters, this end market has been growing at healthy rates, primarily led by sales to space technology companies in the U.S. that demand large amounts of atmospheric and processed gases for manufacturing and launches, as well as coating to aviation engines mainly through our PST business.","Price contributed to a 2% increase in sales for the quarter, driven primarily by strong price actions in Asia, Europe and North America on both merchant and package. Sequentially, volume growth at 3% was broad-based across all end markets but led by food and beverage, in primarily North America and Europe due to seasonality. In Europe alone, food and beverage grew 17% sequentially given our strong network in the region.","Currency translation was flat year-over-year, but negative 2% sequentially, as major currencies weakened versus the U.S. dollar. The strengthening of the U.S. economy coupled with global trade concerns and political uncertainty have contributed to this trend, and we anticipate it will continue through the back half of the year.","Operating profit of $713 million was $92 million or 15% better than last year, and $41 million or 6% better than the first quarter. Operating margins expanded 140 basis points year-over-year and 90 basis points sequentially led by overall strong fundamentals in the base business.","Operating cash flow was $790 million and capital expenditures were $351 million, of which 65% was invested in North America, mainly in the U.S. Free cash flow was $439 million which was used to pay dividends and reduce net debt below $8 billion, the lowest level since 2012 prior to the NuC02 acquisition.","Project backlog for the quarter rose to $1.7 billion, up $200 million from prior period after starting up two large ASU's to serve CNOOK in China and winning three on-site projects, two in Asia and one in North America. Of the total backlog, close to half will supply chemicals, 40% will serve electronics and the balance the aerospace and manufacturing end markets.","Additionally, we have over 30 small on-site project wins totaling $80 million in investment that we expect to start-up in 2019 but are not part of our project backlog since each investment is under $5 million. But similar to the project backlog, these investments have fixed monthly payments and are underpinned by a long-term contract.","As a result of our disciplined capital management and cash focus, the after-tax return on capital closed the quarter at 13.6%. This is the fifth consecutive quarter where we have expanded return on capital and we expect it to continue improving throughout 2018.","With that, let me now turn the call back to Matt, who will discuss our third quarter outlook.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Please turn to slide seven for an outlook on the third quarter. At this point, we are anticipating similar business trends across all segments, adjusted for normal seasonality. For Q3, we expect more stable operating conditions for both crude, CO2 suppliers and U.S. Gulf Coast refiners, although helium will remain tight due to certain source outages. Tax rates should remain in the 23% to 25% range.","The most significant difference for Q3 relates to foreign currency rates. You may recall that we had a 3% FX tailwind in the first quarter and no year-over-year FX effect for the second quarter. In fact, for the second quarter, we originally anticipated a 2% tailwind in the earnings guidance which quickly evaporated to 0%.","Based on recent forward rates, the second half of 2018 could experience translational currency headwinds of 2% to 4%, as the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen from higher interest rates and a stronger economy. Earnings guidance is not provided for Q3 due to the anticipated merger close date with Linde, which is consistent with the full-year approach taken this January.","Now since it is possible this could be the last Praxair earnings call, I'd like to personally thank all 26,000-plus employees for their tireless effort and support. For over 25 years, the Praxair name has been synonymous with operational excellence, prudent capital management and industry-leading performance. So although the name Praxair may go away, the people will continue to thrive as we join with Linde to create a new, more valuable company.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you, and good morning, everyone.","","Good morning.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just a question, if we look through North America and if you look at the pricing in merchant versus packaged gas, could you just give us a sense of the trends there?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","As you saw on our total North American slide, pricing for the entire segment is up a few percent here. So of the 2% you may recall that on-site, really we don't show much in price, so that represents all of the merchant and package price improvements over the entire revenue balance.","So what I would say from that perspective is your low single to mid single-digit pricing we're seeing both in packaged as we will as merchant. As you can imagine, we are seeing inflation across North America. In some case, it's power; in other areas, in distribution costs. So we need to continue to do this, as you can imagine, to recover that inflation. Some of it is contractual in our merchant package contract. Some are actually pricing actions that we have to go out and get.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And just as a follow up, I might have missed this, but did you talk about what volume was in Asia if you stripped out the product \u2013 the project start-ups?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","We've said consolidated of the 5%, a little less than half is related to projects and the balance organic for the total consolidated. I'd say Asia is probably a little more projects, closer to half for the entire segment.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Your line is open.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Good morning.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Duffy.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Question on Latin America: The run rate, does it still feel like it's falling, or have we kind of stabilized at a lower level and so if we kind of anniversary what we've seen over the last quarter, that gets us a decent look for the next year or so?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","That's a question we're all trying to figure out. I would say, as you know our South American business a little more than three-quarters would be Brazil, but I'll start with the non-Brazil section. I think there, we continue to do fairly well. It's more just of a currency issue. Places like Argentina, Colombia, we do have more resilient markets in some of those countries that from a growth rate perspective continue to be pretty good. But it's getting drowned out with some of the currency effects.","Within Brazil, clearly the trucker strike, we lost about an entire week in the month of May, and really did not get much of that back. So it's hard to take this particular quarter given that that sort of anomaly that happened. But when I look underlying what we're seeing in Brazil, clearly we continue to see improvements in the on-site metals as you see more metals being produced.","Now part of that is for export with the real softening, it's making those products more competitive globally. But I'm hoping that some of that could be for use for internal to start some thawing. But it really, until the election, it's going to be hard to see.","As you may recall, in North America when we hit some industrial recessionary conditions going back four years ago, metals was the first one to rebound and recover and then over time merchant and then package. And Brazil right now, we just haven't seen merchant and package really turning the corner.","Next quarter hopefully will be a better comp just given the lack of any anomalies, but frankly until the October elections, it's going to be tough. I think we're going to really have to see what happens in 2019.","And I think Mexico is kind of a good example. When Manuel was elected, there obviously were some views and concerns, but when he came out and announced kind of his cabinet, his views, I think it calmed some of the markets and calmed some of the views, and we'll have to see if that happens in Brazil. So time will tell.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then relatively small business for you, but your Russian business, the headlines have obviously been getting worse throughout the year. Do you see that in your business, or does that feel like it's still the same structural strategic bet that you have always made, be patient long-term and it's still a decent place to be?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Well, we always need to be patient, long-term in this industry, as you know, Duffy, given the nature of the structure of it. Clearly economic cycles will go up and down. I would say with Russia to your point it is quite small for us in the grand scheme. It's mostly on-site, and those on-site contracts we feel very good about. So from that perspective, we absolutely expect that will be withheld, or upheld I should say. A lot of them are based on English law and things like that. So from that perspective, we feel good.","The merchant and package has been tough for a while. I would say more than just the last six months we had a period of stagflation there for a bit of time, and so from that perspective \u2013 which is very small for us by the way, the package and merchant.","So Russia has not been easy for a while, but the on-sites have been very good, and anything related to I think to exports of natural resources, continues to be good. So we'll have to see. It is one of our geographies, and at this point we haven't made a lot of incremental investments, though. And we'll just have to see what opportunities present themselves in the future.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks, fellows.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison from KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi, guys. Nice quarter. It looks like the backlog continues to improve, you're at 1.7. Can you maybe remind us where that backlog peaked historically and given the industrial backdrop has been pretty positive here, do you see that backlog continuing to improve in the next couple years?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Mike, I think from us, our backlog peaked probably in the mid 2's. One thing you would want to take into consideration on that, we had a large steam methane reformer product that was in there for quite some time, probably seven, eight years when you go back in time on that. We did resolve that. That actually became a sale of equipment when all the dust settles. So if you pull that one out, I'd say low 2s is probably the more normalized where we peaked on that.","The nice thing I like about this current cycle, to your point, it is a good cycle and what we're seeing and I'd say the quality of our contracts and customers is a nice rhythm of start-ups and replacements, start-ups and replacements.","From my perspective, the best thing about a backlog is a backlog that is constantly churning. Growing backlog can be good, but we need to make sure that we're starting them up. So right now, we're having large start-ups. As you know, we had a very large start-up in the first quarter but we're replacing it with new projects, and as long as we can keep replenishing and actually taking something that is a use of cash and turning it into a source of cash, I think that's quite successful.","So we feel very good. To your point, it's gotten up to 1.2. When I look out the rest of the year and we kind of probability adjust, it's possible we could have a 2 handle on the backlog again. And so I think the backdrop is pretty strong, and we feel good about our prospects and where we are on some of these pre-backlog opportunities.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. And then in terms of pricing, I think you mentioned inflation, your pricing is excess of inflation to quite a degree. How much of that is just driven by what you're able to do and the, to some degree maybe industry pricing and everybody's working their way to get that pricing action?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Well, a portion of it is just how you contract, Mike. There are several contracts out there that have inflationary aspects, either escalations or ability to surcharge through for power escalation. One thing is very clear is you are seeing power escalate in many geographies in the world for various reasons.","So having the right contracting to be able to recover that, I think is quite important. But aside from that, it's just a matter of just having at the very low levels to have to grind it out and work through it. But It's, as you know, a very local industry, and inflation is a big, big driver behind the pricing in this industry.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. I don't have a question on developments in your deal, but I have a question on the structure of the deal. Could you close the deal without Chinese approval, that is, if there were regulatory delays in China and you didn't hear from them?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Well, Jeff, I figured you'd be the one that would try and find a way around it. I would say this much, and I don't want to get into any depth on any of these discussions, but in our BCA, we list nine regulatory agencies that are required to close the deal. And that is a public document. So you can go pull that information and see the nine required to actually close. Obviously, we have to file with others that are very important, but of those others, they are not required to close the deal per the BCA.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And if you received regulatory approval from China on, I don't know, October 23, could the deal still be closed on October 24?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Yeah, I don't want to get into any specifics, Jeff, on either hypothetical situations or views of regulatory decisions. So, at this stage, unfortunately, it's something we're working very constructively and we're having good dialogues across all global regulators. And we will continue to update you guys on events as they are warranted and relevant. But at this point, I don't want to get into any specifics, especially with any specific regulators.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Hi. A few hopefully, short ones. About a decade ago, you guys used to talk about having about a 1% tailwind for organic growth just from energy efficiency investments. Are you seeing the industrial appetite for those come back?","And then related to that, a couple years ago you were talking about how over, say, a three or four-year period, you might have line of sight to about a 3% annual tailwind from on-sites starting up on average, not each year. Is the current backlog and the trends you're seeing in line with that or better than you would have expected when you were making those comments?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","I'll start, Laurence, with your second question and then go to your first. So, you're absolutely right. We had laid out back in our strategy, probably four years ago that based on our backlog, we anticipated 3% EPS, and we stuck with EPS because as you know, each contract can be a little bit different on how the revenue is reported.","But we said the 3% EPS growth rate that we see extending out three-plus years. And as you may recall earlier this year, we extended that another year based on the wins. So we still believe that we can see a 3% EPS plus or minus neighborhood of improvement over the next three years to four years based on this current backlog.","Now if our backlog starts to increase, we can reassess that. But this was based on a roughly $1.5 billion continually replenishing backlog which is where we still are right now give or take.","So I'd say, yes, those dynamics we still see valid over the next three years to four years, and if we continue to maintain this level of backlog, that should continue out more years.","From your first question, as you may recall, a lot of the energy efficiency I'd say we were seeing many years ago were for reducing natural gas consumption. So for instance, if someone had a natural gas fired burner, any type of combustion operation you do, you want to eliminate inert gas, meaning nitrogen primarily. So by displacing and burning in an oxygen environment, you would accomplish that.","Given that natural gas at least in the U.S. is much cheaper, those applications are less than what they were probably a decade ago. But I would still say in emerging markets, anyone using higher cost hydrocarbons, especially oil, that application is still very, very valid.","But more what I would say we're seeing displaced that is environmental reasons for NOx and SOx reduction by burning in a better environment, you can reduce that. And you see that a lot also in the glass industry where it gets into even more so with throughput improvements in addition to environmental.","So I would say the original main drivers have shifted, but they're still relevant in certain markets and in certain end markets, and we're still seeing some improvements with that energy efficiency.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","And have you received any clarification from the managers of the different equity indexes as to whether or not you'll belong, which ones you'll belong in? Or will there be a technical period post the deal closing where it will be ambiguous?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Yeah, they can't tell us until post-close, as you probably know. So they're not able to make the decision. You could probably look at other deals as you know like Dow DuPont and some other relevant situations, and they're not able to make any announcements until the deal is consummated and they review that, and then they make their decision for index inclusion.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Perfect.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","And obviously we're pursuing both the New York Stock Exchange, S&P 500 as you can imagine and the DAX in the Frankfurt Exchange.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Matt, just on the U.S. packaged gas strength, can you give a little bit of detail as to where and what's driving that and how long you think this is, I think you said low-double digits right now is sustainable?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Hi, David. High-single digit actually all in. What we're probably seeing is mid-single digit plus on gas, and then we're still double digit on hard goods right now. And it's funny. I asked the same question internally here, and the answer is it still is pretty broad-based.","Clearly manufacturing, you look at industrial production and you look at some of the subcategories of industrial production like metal fabrication, construction, equipment, they're doing quite well. So they drive a lot of welding shielding gases. So think argon is a big driver in that area. That continues to do well. Construction does well. But we're also seeing a variety across many other end markets, some resilient markets, health care, some of the packaged gases we deliver into hospitals. But also aerospace, as Juan had mentioned, even refining, things for gas analytics.","So it still is pretty broad-based. And packaged gas, as we've always said, tends to be a very good proxy with industrial production, especially the subcategories and the manufacturing categories. So at this point, there's no one market I could point to that I would say is more strong or weaker than the other. But it's fairly broad-based.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Very good. And, Matt, just go through the merchant operating by region?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Sure. When you look at the U.S., right now we're still probably high 70's in base merchant in the LIN and LOX, but argon continues to remain tight. As you know, it's more based on oxygen base loads, and as I mention, demand is high in met fab, so argon is still tight across most of North America.","Brazil is still probably mid 70's, and that's just as much a function of we still have some on-site customers undertaker pay that we do over. So it's probably base molecules are constricting even as much if not more than the liquefaction capacity there.","When I look at Europe, we continue to see some improvements. We're getting up to, say, mid 70s now for LIN and LOX. Argon a little bit less than that. So Europe is running well. Asia is one that it's a little tighter in some areas, but it's kind of overall probably in the 80s as we're seeing good demand that continues to be strong across several countries in Asia. So I'd say trends are going well, but we're able to get good utilization out of our asset base globally. But clearly we have room to expand if needed in all of our markets.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from PJ Juvekar from Citi. Your line is open.","PJ Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning, Matt.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Good morning, PJ.","PJ Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I had a question on pricing related to your earlier question. Pricing was up in packaged gases in both North America and Europe. And do you think that packaged gases' pricing leads much in pricing in that sense that you see it, of course, in packaged gases which are shorter than contrasts compared to merchant?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Well, I could say this much on Europe just to add to that. Part of that pricing is not only recovering inflation in the packaged gas side, but also we do have a refrigerant business there in Italy, and as you can imagine, part of that pass through was both power and flooring in refrigerants and also some of that price. So it's a combination of packaged gases in our refrigerant business in southern Europe.","But I would say I don't know if I'd call it a leader, but I would say that packaged gases tend to be much tighter correlated with inflation. As you know, in package, the contracts are not very long. They could be one, two, three years, or they might just be purchase orders. So they are the most sensitive and probably the most elastic as far as pricing, but they also tend to be repriced more to inflation faster.","And in some cases, especially hard goods where you know we operate primarily as a distributor in hard goods, these hard goods can be sourced from various countries, from various locations. And so as you may get cost creep, whether it's through tariffs or other various raw material items like metals, then that has to be recaptured in the pricing to recover that inflation, so you're seeing some of that as well in packaged gases to recover those hard goods' higher costs.","So it's a combination I'd say of all that. So I don't know if I'd say it's a leader, but I would definitely say it's probably most closely tied timing-wise to inflation given the short duration of contracts and given their exposure to a variety of both hard goods and gases.","PJ Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you for that. And then you won two on-site projects in Asia and one in North America. Can you talk about those? And as you look forward to second half of 2018 and then in 2019, can you size the impact of new projects starting up?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","So I'll start with the starting up. It's not a number we have disclosed as you can imagine. Generally, we've been on average probably a third, a third, a third just on the average build cycle is three years. I don't see next year drastically different than that, could be a little bit lower because as you know this year we had a couple large start-ups, including our largest project ever. So I think the start-up next year we still believe will overall reach that 3% number in that range I talked about before for EPS growth, but the backlog reduction somewhere in that neighborhood of a third or maybe a little less.","As far as the ones we won, chemicals and electronics primarily. As we mentioned, when you look at the U.S., still seeing strong chemicals activity across the spectrum and so investments continue to be made, and this was an asset related to that investment. And in Asia, one in chemicals and one in electronics. So as we have mentioned in prior calls, these continue to be kind of the strongest growth end markets, primarily in Asia and North America as you know. And we continue to see good opportunities.","And if I look at our pre-backlog, the major three markets related to that are still electronics, chemicals and energy to an extent. Those are, right now I would say, probably in the best build cycle. But hopefully we'll start seeing things in manufacturing and some of the other end markets soon.","PJ Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you for that.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from Stephen Byrne from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Matt, just continuing on that commentary, how would you characterize that pre-backlog geographically?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Well, right now, Steve, as you look at our current backlog, it's about half Asia, half North America in terms of where we stand. And when I look at the pre-backlog, it's probably not too distant from that. We were more heavily North America for a period of time. Asia had built up.","If anything, now we could be a little bit higher North America, but again, these are projects that have been actively worked on for the last anywhere from year to two years. And we'll have to see which ones ultimately come to fruition. But it changes based on where we are in, I'll say the starting gate and contract negotiations. But again, U.S. Gulf Coast and Asia are the two primaries.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just a question about the disruption in Brazil from the trucking impasse. Is it fair to say that some of your customers down in Brazil are still impacted by the lack of a settled trucking freight rate? And maybe the \u2013 conversely to that, do you compete with anyone in the merchant business down there that is struggling in that they have some outsourcing of that merchant trucking?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Well, I would just say high level, everybody was affected by the trucking. It was not discriminatory in any way, and the industrial production number for the month as I mentioned at minus 7% pretty much characterized and validated that effect. So from that perspective, we were all affected.","If I look at now, things seem to have gotten back to normal. I mean, clearly, for a smaller company, it may be more difficult. But when I look at the broad scheme of things, I think we're all pretty much back to normal there. We haven't heard of any additional issues. But normal is still a challenging situation, as we know, given the political uncertainty. So I don't think there's any residual issues right now, large or small customers. But we'll have to see what happens over the next several months.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Mike Harrison from Seaport Global Securities. Your line is open.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Good morning.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Speaking of trucking issues, we're hearing a lot about rising freight and logistics costs, particularly in the U.S. Can you just remind us as you think about your merchant and packaged gas fleet in the U.S., I guess North America overall. How much of that is in house versus outsourced? How much inflation have you seen from either rising labor or fuel cost? And how confident do you feel you are in your ability to pass that through to customers?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Okay. Mike. So I'll start with just the diesel, kind of \u2013 that's a structure of a pass-through surcharge that is a contractual component. As I mentioned earlier, passing through inflation can be very contractual, and diesel is a classic example of that.","So these are aspects that you contract to recover, and so from that perspective, there is a lag. It's usually two, three months. But that's something that will go up and down with the diesel cost. As far as truckers, you're absolutely right. The costs are going up. It is tight to get truckers.","But this is not, I would say anything new. We go through this in cycles, as you know, with how the economy especially in the United States is going. When the economy's going strong, there tends to be more shortages of truckers, and when the economy is softer, you're able to get some. And then things like Amazon and FedEx and UPS will continue to absorb more drivers just in general.","So when I look at Praxair, this is something that we've had to manage since our inception, and we always keep a balance, as you mentioned of in-house drivers versus of outsource of both contract and common carriers. We'll use both. And that percentage of in-house can range anywhere from 50% to 75%. It flexes up and down just based on conditions. And then we will use outside truckers for surge capacity and also ongoing variable.","Clearly, they got to meet our safety standards, and that's a big part of getting them trained, getting them as part of our culture. So it takes some time for us to get them to be the right drivers. But it's something we're used to. We've got a great team that does this day in day out, and from my perspective, while it's challenging, while it's tough, there is nothing I've seen overly concerning about this current trend versus any prior trends.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","I appreciate the detail there. And just in terms of the U.S. on-site business, it looks like U.S. refinery utilization is running very strong. Just wondering if you can comment in a little more detail on the strength you're seeing in hydrogen and did you see any planned outages that were pushed out as refineries look to run harder? Thanks.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","As you may recall in the first quarter, we had some significant turnarounds that we mentioned, and that occurred. And those were ones that we believe were pushed out from 2017. You had a combination, as you know, of strong refining margins coupled with the hurricane toward the back end of the year. So that pushed a lot of turnarounds into Q1.","The vast majority of our customers were back-end running hard, like you said, although this quarter we did have two large customers that were having some outages. They are back running now. So from that perspective, I'd say right now we're seeing pretty strong demand and strong volumes, and the refiners from my perspective want to run.","And so hydrogen is doing well. So is oxygen and nitrogen, which both go to refineries as well. So at this stage, things are running well, and then we'll just have to see how things go forward.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jim Sheehan from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","Good morning. This is Pete (47:22) on for Jim.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Good morning, Pete (47:24).","Unknown Speaker","Did you quantify the margin impact in Europe from the C02 disruption? And given that strong pricing growth of 3%, do you expect that the margin uplift there will accelerate in the back half of the year?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Well, we didn't disclose that, but I'd say consolidated it might have shaved close to anywhere between $0.005 and $.01 off total results. So, you can probably back into what that might have meant from a Europe perspective.","And, yes, when you look at that price of three percent, as you may recall, inflation has been challenging in Europe but we're starting to see some signs. There are some tightness of certain products, and I think that is driving a little bit of the inflation as well.","And so our team has done a good job to go out there and get back some of this pent-up inflation. And power has been a big area. You may recall when you look at pass through, we had 4% this quarter. I think last quarter we were a similar number, low-single digits. So we've started to see power as I'd say the initial area of inflation, and it's kind of creeping through in other areas. So our team needed to get ahead of it and they did.","So when I look at that, I think that's a good result. Now, as you can imagine, this second quarter is the high season for C02. So, we had the outages during a difficult time. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, most of our sources are back and running to normal rates. But we see a normal seasonal decline at this point just given the seasonality. But we feel we should be able to manage this now given the balance.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Thank you.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","Morning. This is Matt (49:15) on for Kevin. Thank you for squeezing me in.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Sure, Matt (49:18).","Unknown Speaker","So merchant price in China has improved, and I think company utilization rates as you had mentioned in Asia were kind of in the low 80% range. But it seems like industry utilization rates in China, in particular, are somewhere in the 50% range. So are we just catching up to a more normalized level of pricing here and then going to expect to balance out, or should we expect continued price traction as utilization rates kind of continue to tighten?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","From my perspective, Matt (49:44), I think it's I guess your former of trying to catch up. You go back the last several years, it's no secret that there was a large excess supply of merchant product in the China market. A lot of that was driven by both capacity in what I'll call industrial gas but also capacity of the nonindustrial gas meaning steel mills that had by-product coming off of their captive plants.","So this drove both not just low utilization rates but just more supply than demand, and pricing in China was one of the lower pricings around the world given this. So while China throughout the years has had inflation, you could debate it but anywhere from mid to high-single digits. The pricing and you just look back at our history was not reflected of that.","So I would say at this point now you've had some structural supply impacts that have been favorable where capacity, especially related to the steel mills has come out as steel mills as have been shuttered. It remains to be seen how much more that will happen. I think that seems to have slowed. But you also have demand improving, and the combination of that has allowed us to capture some of this pent-up inflation from several years to get pricing that is closer to what we would expect.","I mean, because you got to remember in China, it has some of the highest mill rates in the world. So you've got to take that in consideration when you look at merchant pricing because power, as you know, is one of our biggest inputs. So from that perspective, we need to get pricing more in line with what the recent inflation has been and what the costs are to serve that business. And I think that's what's been happening as we've seen some both structural improvements and demand improvements.","Unknown Speaker","Thanks. And if I may just slide one more in. Can you remind us your stance as it relates to pursuing Chinese coal gasification projects? Your competitors' comments make it sound like competition for those has picked up.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Well, I could say this. Our stance has been the same for the last decade plus. We've been quite clear that whether it's China coal gasification projects or other projects, we will pursue ones that meet our density strategy, that meet our return criteria, not just financial return but also who we're partner with and our technology and matching that up. So that's something we participated in in south part of China, eastern part of China in integrated industrial parks and we have had long-standing, strong relationships with customers over a decade on that front.","We have not pursued moving upstream or we have not pursued going into regions where we were not able to achieve the density model. So we've been quite consistent as far back as I've been here, and we feel good about how we're doing that.","Unknown Speaker","All right. Thank you.","Juan Pelaez - Praxair, Inc.","Thank you again for participating in our second quarter earnings call.

My name is Stephanie, and I'll be your coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today, Ms. Kelcey Hoyt, Director, Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Kelcey E. Hoyt","Thanks, Stephanie. Good morning and thank you for attending our second quarter earnings call and webcast. I'm joined this morning by Jim Sawyer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Liz Hirsch, our Vice President and Controller.","Today's presentation materials are available on our website at praxair.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference.","Jim and I will now review Praxair's second quarter results and outlook. We'll then be available to answer questions.","James S. Sawyer","Thank you, Kelcey, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 3 for our consolidated second quarter results. A first glance at the slide reveals the sales and earnings growth were subdued and fell short of our long-term objectives. But I want to emphasize that our results were significantly constrained by negative currency translation, lower pass-through of natural gas price and hires and sales, and deteriorating manufacturing conditions in Europe and Brazil.","Having said that, we had fantastic results in North America, which we expect will continue, and when Brazil and Europe turnaround, we'll be back on our historic trajectory of double-digit earnings growth. We've taken restructure actions in Brazil and are evaluating additional actions across Europe and in Surface Technologies in European plants, which serve the manufacturing sector. These steps will ensure better results in these weak spots without waiting for a rising tide of economic conditions.","There's a chart on Page 11, I would like to refer you to in the appendix for the teleconference slide deck, which shows the volatility of our 6 major overseas currencies and also why we are lowering our guidance for the remainder of the year by about 3%. Year-over-year as of June, the Brazilian real has fallen 22%,the Euro, 11%, the Mexican peso, 16%, and the Canadian dollar 4%, and the Indian rupee, 19%, and the Korean won, 8%. Our year-over-year sales declined 2% to $2.8 billion, but excluding a 6% negative currency impact and a 2% impact from lower gas pass-through of natural gas, sales would have grown 6%. More importantly operating profit, x currency, was up about 9% and EPS about 11%, demonstrating that we're still getting leverage down the income statement in productivity and strong cash flow.","In fact, operating cash flow was a record $725 million, representing more than 25% of our sales.","Our debt-to-capital ratio for the quarter was 53% and debt-to-EBITDA was 1.9x. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $164 million, and repurchased stock of $104 million, net of issuances. $1.3 billion remains available under the share repurchase program authorized in January of this year. After-tax return on capital for the quarter is 14.2%, and reflects the large amount of projects under construction, and therefore, a significant amount of project capital on our balance sheet not yet completed. Return on equity increased to 29.7%.","Now please turn to Slide 4 for our updated earnings guidance. In the third quarter, we see a continuation of similar business trends sequentially, and are issuing earnings guidance in the range $1.35 to $1.40. This guidance reflects the assumption of an additional $0.03 of currency headwind sequentially from the second quarter, as the major currencies swings occurred in late April. On a year-over-year basis, our third quarter earnings expectation reflects negative currency translation impact of about $0.12 per share. As such, for the full year, we've lowered our earnings guidance to $5.60 to $5.70 or about $0.15 to $0.20 from the prior guidance.","The majority of the reduction, or about 2\/3, relates to negative currency translation impact based on current exchange rates. Additionally, volumes everywhere outside of North America are falling short of expectations, and we're not anticipating macroeconomic conditions to improve in the second half. Our long-term growth outlook remains strong and we're maintaining our capital spending forecast of $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion against the backlog of $2.5 billion of projects under construction, with committed customer contracts. As these projects start up over the next 2 to 3 years, they will contribute significantly to sales and earnings growth. The backlog remains strong at $2.5 billion, and reflects 5 plant startups during the quarter, as well as signings in 4 new plants under construction for long-term contracts.","The level of new business activity remains healthy overall. We've seen some recent slowdown in proposal activity in Brazil, but have also seen acceleration of proposal activity in North America. So on balance, it remains about the same.","We remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver the expected 4% to 6% top line growth from new projects and the backlog of projects currently extends that framework through 2015. And now, I will let Kelcey explain in more detail our second quarter results by segment, including recent project signings and startups.","Kelcey E. Hoyt","Thanks, Jim. Please turn to Page 5 for our results in North America. Sales in North America were $1.4 billion, 2% above the prior-year quarter. Underlying sales grew 6% from 4% higher volumes and 2% higher pricing. The effects of cost pass-through, primarily lower cost natural gas, which is contractually passed on to hydrogen customers, reduced sales by 4%. Negative currency translation from Mexico and Canada reduced sales by 2%. Underlying energy market sales in North America were very strong and grew 21% year-over-year. The most significant driver was our on-site supply systems to Gulf Coast refinery. Gulf Coast refinery distillates production is growing and customer margins are improving as customers benefit from lower hydrogen prices, which are tied to the price of natural gas. We also continue to deliver strong spot sales out of our Gulf Coast hydrogen storage cavern to meet customer needs.","Our oil well service business in Mexico continues to run at very high levels and delivered strong volume growth in Mexico. This business primarily provides liquid nitrogen and pressure pumping services to the oil and gas sector. Sequential energy sales were steady, with the growth in the United States and Mexico moderated by the typical second quarter seasonal slowdown in frac-ing for natural gas liquids and oils in the Alberta region of Canada during the spring thaw. Underlying manufacturing sales grew 12% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, with growth in all 3 countries, the United States, Canada and Mexico.","Packaged gas sales remained robust in line with manufacturing strength. In PDI, same-store sales, which excludes currency and acquisitions, were 9% above last year. Gases were up 8% and hard goods were up 10%. Packaged gas primarily serves the manufacturing market but sales were also strong year-over-year to metal fabrication and sequentially strong as well to chemicals and refining.","Underlying sales growth to metals customers were solid at 3% year-over-year. This was due to strong liquid argon sales for stainless steel and metal fabrication, as well as oxygen sales on our pipelines in the northern United States to steel mills. The underlying fundamentals of most North America end markets are good. Underlying on-site sales grew 8% year-over-year and sales from merchant volumes grew 2% year-over-year with liquid hydrogen, nitrogen and argon growth partially offset by weakness in CO2 from reduced dry gas frac-ing.","North America operating profit was $363 million, 11% above the prior-year quarter. Excluding the negative impact of currency translation, the operating profit would've grown 14% from the prior-year quarter. The operating margin was a very strong 26.1%, reflecting volume growth, higher pricing and productivity, which more than offset cost increases and the negative impact of currency translation. Lower cost pass-through, which reduced sales with minimal impact on operating profit, contributed 1% to the operating margin in the quarter. The pipeline of activity for potential further packaged gas acquisitions remain strong. During the quarter, we made packaged gas acquisitions in Orange, California and Tonawanda, New York. We also acquired Canadian Cylinder & Gases, an independent distributor of industrial and specialty gases and welding equipment, located in Prince George, British Columbia. This will enhance our ability to serve current and future customers in this high-growth region of Canada.","During the quarter, we expanded our packaged gas presence in the Northeast region of the United States, to supply industrial and specialty gases as well as hard goods, to meet growing demand. This new location serve the Boston, Hartford and Providence markets.","In Mexico, we started up oxygen supply to Fonderia, a producer of steel billets for the construction industry in North Central, Mexico. The plant with a capacity of 120 tons per day will increase Fonderia's productivity and its production and help Fonderia meet its energy efficiency and environmental requirements. The new facility also increases our production and supply capacity in the region.","Proposal activity for new, on-site plants in North America is increasing. And we are seeing strong activity in energy, chemicals, manufacturing and metals markets. Earlier this week, we announced a signing of a long-term contract to supply Vale, a leading international mining company, with oxygen for a new nickel processing facility being built in Canada. Praxair will build, own and operate an energy-efficient cryogenic air separation unit, with a capacity of approximately 400 tons per day, which is expected to start up in mid-2013. This project is a good example of how our products help our customers improve the environment. Vale will utilize the oxygen to remove sulfur and iron from the nickel. The process will enable Vale to process the nickel ore concentrate directly into finished metals without having to smelt it first, avoiding sulfur dioxide and dust emissions.  Nickel is used to produce stainless steel and other alloys and used in various industries, including aircraft.","Now please turn to Page 6 for our results in Europe. Sales in Europe increased 3% for the second quarter versus 2011. The sales increase was due to the acquisition last year of an increased ownership interest in Europe Praxair located in Scandinavia, which is now consolidated. Underlying sales were comparable to the prior year as 2% higher pricing offset lower volume. The weaker euro reduced sales by 9%.","Price actions in the region are sticking, and we are getting traction across all countries in Europe. Just as we do with any with any price action, in any region around the world, we'll review margin contribution of individual customer accounts and we'll continue to drive price increases in the region.","Packaged gas volumes declined 5% year-over-year in Spain, Italy and Germany. This reflects weakness in the metal fabrication and manufacturing markets, which are significant contributors to the lower industrial economic activity versus a year ago. Sequentially, volumes continue to decline in southern Europe, particularly Spain.","Operating profit of $68 million was 6% below the prior year. Excluding acquisitions in currency, underlying operating profit decreased 9%, primarily driven by lower volumes, partially offset by productivity and cost savings resulting from our fourth quarter 2011 restructure.","In addition, we are currently assessing further fixed cost actions to be taken in Europe to ensure we are right-sizing the cost structure of the business to reflect expected longer-term slower growth in the region, especially southern Europe. We are on track to start up 2 of our 4 plants currently under construction in Russia later this year. These 2 plants will serve the chemical and glass industry. New project proposal activity is growing in Russia and Scandinavia, including the metals, energy and manufacturing market.","Page 7 shows our results in South America. South American segment sales were $520 million, down 15% from the prior-year quarter. Underlying sales grew 1% for the quarter, primarily due to improved pricing, partially offset by lower volumes. Negative currency impacts, primarily the weakening of the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar reduced sales by 16% in the quarter. Higher volumes from new on-site production facilities were more than offset by lower volumes to merchant and packaged gas customers, largely attributable to the lower industrial production rates in Brazil. By end market, year-over-year sales increased to metals, health care and energy customers, and were lower to manufacturing and chemical customers.","Sequentially, underlying sales were steady for the quarter, with higher pricing offset by lower volumes. Negative currency impact reduced sales by 8% in the second quarter versus the first. Operating profit in South America was $110 million, 21% below the prior quarter, primarily due to negative currency translation impacts. X currency, operating profit was comparable to the prior year, as higher pricing offset cost increases primarily related to power, distribution and cost inflation.","In South America, Brazil has just experienced the third consecutive quarter of negative industrial production. In addition, June was our lowest volume month of the quarter, indicating volatility with little sign of near-term improvement. Current Brazil Central Bank consensus industrial production for the year is now 0, which implies an industrial production rate of about 2.4% for the second half of the year. We remain bullish on Brazil in the medium to long-term, given the strong growth fundamentals in place in its emerging economy as it continues to transition from an export-driven economy to a more local consumption driven market with a growing middle class. In addition, there is quite a bit of pent-up demand for infrastructure build-out in front of the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics.","The government has pulled several stimulus levers quickly to stimulate demand, including lowering the interest rate, lowering consumption taxes and currency intervention. However, given the general global macro uncertainty with the European debt crisis and the slower growth environment in China, the stimulus measures are not working as quickly as they historically have.","As such, during the second quarter, we took actions to reduce cost in South America, primarily headcount reductions, and we'll realize the benefits in the second half of this year.","South America currently has 8 projects in the backlog across 4 countries, which include Brazil, Peru, Argentina and Uruguay, and diverse industries, such as metals, chemicals and manufacturing. These projects are scheduled to start up between the third quarter this year and the end of 2013.","During the quarter, we started on-site plant to serve a metals customer in S\u00e3o Paulo state. This location will also supply the surrounding area with merchant product, including liquid argon. We also started an air separation plant in Columbia during the quarter to supply Gerdau, one of the largest suppliers of specialty steel in the world. The plant will also produce liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon to the local market, in segments such as oil and gas, manufacturing, chemicals, food and beverage and medical. Praxair has production facilities located in all regions of the country, which ensures supply reliability throughout Colombia.","Please turn to Slide 8 for our results in Asia. Sales of $348 million were comparable to the prior-year quarter. Volume growth of 3% came primarily from higher on-site sales in China, India and Korea, including new plant startups for metals and chemicals customers. Overall growth was negatively impacted by lower sales to electronics customers in Asia due to lower demand from semiconductor, flat-panel display and solar customers. Electronic sales were 3% below prior year. Lower merchant and packaged gas pricing, primarily due to the electronics end market, reduced sales by 1% from the prior-year quarter. We expect this challenging price environment to continue in the near term, as long as electronics volumes remain weak.","Asia's operating profit grew 8% from the prior-year quarter and included a gain on land sale. Lower price decreased operating profit as did currency. During the quarter, we started up 2 plants for customers under long-term take-or-pay contracts, both located in China. Praxair China started up a new air separation plant in Nanjing, for Meishan Iron and Steel, a subsidiary of Baosteel. The plant has a capacity of 1,700 tons per day and supplies oxygen, nitrogen and argon to support Meishan Steel's growing demand, as well as deliver added value and energy efficiency, product quality and process safety. This plant nearly doubles the existing oxygen production capacity serving Meishan Steel. We've been supplying industrial gases to Meishan Steel for over a decade and have already built a number of air separation plants for them in Nanjing.","During the second quarter, we also started up a large, single train, 3,000 ton per day air separation plant in the Wuwei, 100 kilometers from Nanjing to supply oxygen, nitrogen and clean air to the Anhui Wuwei coal-based chemicals project. This is another example of Praxair China's demonstrated capability to supply oxygen to coal gasification units which provide feedstock to the chemical industry.","About 40% or $1 billion of our backlog is for long-term customer projects in China, India and Korea that will start up between this quarter and early 2015. New project activity for the region remains robust. During the second quarter, we announced the signing of a long-term supply contract with Yankuang Group to supply industrial gases to its coal gasification process for the production of methanol and downstream chemicals at its chemical park in northern China. Praxair will construct a large air separation plant with a capacity of 3,000 tons of oxygen per day. The new plant is scheduled to start up in early 2015, and will replace Yankuang's existing air separation unit. The liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon produced will be integrated with Praxair China's liquid production and distribution network in the region.","Our results for Surface Technologies are shown on Page 9. Surface technologies sales for the quarter were $168 million and comparable to the prior year. Underlying sales increased 4% driven by higher volumes and pricing. Sales increase came from higher aerospace coatings and increased coatings for energy markets, primarily oil and gas. Currency negatively impacted sales by 4% due primarily to the weakening of the euro versus the U.S. dollar.","Operating profit remained unchanged for the quarter at $27 million. Higher volumes and leverage from improved pricing increased operating profit. These benefits were offset in the quarter by currency translation impacts and cost increases, primarily related to employee wages and benefit cost and general inflation. With that, I'd like to turn this call over to Q&A. [Operator Instructions].","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was just wondering if in your North American business, you can kind of talk about what the monthly trends were throughout the quarter and maybe into July. And then do you think that your customer base will be impacted by the strengthening dollar and maybe some of their competitiveness goes away so that can actually be a headwind for them going forward?","James S. Sawyer","Okay. Let me take the first part of that. We haven't seen any sequential slowdown on a of month-to-month basis moving all the way back to the first quarter through July. Everything is continuing to be strong and growing. We've had fantastic growth in the manufacturing sector. That may slow down a bit but we haven't seen that yet. And so -- and then in terms of the competitiveness, I think that the strong dollar has been basically caused by the fact that the U.S. economy is doing so much better than any other economy in the world. But I don't think it's at a point where it impacts the competitiveness of our customers as a whole. And secondly, I think that the benefit of lower natural gas prices is helping our customers certainly more than any impact from the currency.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And then just on the Asia business, maybe I missed it, what was the gain on sale of land that you said was included in net profit. How big was that?","James S. Sawyer","Right. So we have about 7 plants selling liquid nitrogen, or high-purity nitrogen to Samsung, and the Korean government is putting a major highway project right through that area and is asking us to move our plants and buying the land through that process. So we had a land sale gain worth roughly $0.03 a share in Asia segment operating profit. But on an overall basis, that was pretty much offset by restructuring costs that we took, particularly in the South America segment. So on a segment basis, on a year-over-year, Asia is probably $10 million higher than it should be and South America is probably $10 million lower than it should be.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Could you just discuss a little bit more -- you talked about there's been stimulus in Brazil and, I guess, there's also, obviously, been a lot of stimulus in China. And could you just sort of talk about both markets in terms of -- does Brazil need more stimulus or does it more time? And then also, what effects, if any, are you seeing from the initial stimulus in China?","James S. Sawyer","Right. Well, let me start out with the Brazil. And on the industrial production has been declining in Brazil beginning last August. So it's pretty much almost one year now. And that's a combination of several things. It started out, to some extent, being a result of what was the very weak -- or very strong Brazilian real, that was making exports from Brazil less competitive, but now it is devalued by 23%. That should reverse itself. Another bottleneck in the Brazil industrial economy is the availability of skilled labor. And I think that, really, what's happened is so much construction activity with Petrobras, with the World Cup and everything else going on, that there's been a shortage in skilled production or construction labor, manufacturing labor, production labor, which has really bottlenecked the economy and caused inflation. So about a year ago, the Brazilian Fed increased interest rates pretty significantly to try to stop inflation. They've now lowered interest rates significantly, and they're doing some other policy moves in terms of: number one, keeping exchange rates weaker; and then, number two, certain taxes on imported items and so forth. Another thing that's happened in Brazil is that the trade with Argentina has pretty much come to a standstill based on what's going on in Argentina. So there's a lot of factors there. I think that the long-term secular growth in South America and Brazil are certainly intact. But they've got to work their way through some of these issues. Now China's a different story. I think it's hard to expect that China's GDP growth would be 15% a year, for ever and ever and ever. So now, IP growth and GDP growth are somewhere  between 5% and 10% and I think, on a sequential basis, probably lower than that. Then, in addition, you've got a change over in power and a power struggle going on within the ruling party, which remains to be worked out during the rest of 2012. Now that hurt us quite a bit in the quarter just ended, primarily because of slowdown in demand for argon and lower argon prices. And that was caused primarily by a slowdown in the production of photovoltaics. Long-run, though, the five-year plan for China embraces the end markets that are our growth markets. And that's primarily moving to more coal gasification for energy and for production of chemicals, and more industrialization in the middle area of the country, which really hasn't grown very much. So I think that the secular growth is still intact, but we're going through kind of a downdraft that's more of a cyclical nature. And then, I guess, while I'm talking about it, I'll just add India to the equation there, because India is in a recession, also, due to -- due primarily to sort of government gridlock. And that needs to be worked out as well. But I think the emerging market countries do have -- probably have a high multiple of industrial gas demand growth as opposed to GDP growth, emerging market countries tend to be more focused on construction and manufacturing, and less so on services. And that's really what drives our growth. So we're still in the long term, optimistic about that, and we think that we're best positioned than any industrial gas company in the emerging markets overall.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","A couple of questions on North America. Can you just outline what your operating rate was in Lin\/Lox, and you seem to be one of the few people not talking about shortages in helium. So I'm just wondering if your supply situation is better than others there.","Kelcey E. Hoyt","Operating rates in North America?","James S. Sawyer","Well, okay, so operating rates in North America are strong. On-site oxygen for the steel industry continues to be strong. Merchant Lin\/Lox volumes continue to be strong, although a little bit of a falloff in the second quarter in Canada related to our frac-ing business, which has a seasonal gut-down as the ice melts and the roads are shutdown for a while. So operating rate is strong, really across all end markets in Canada, Mexico and the U.S. Now helium, everybody's talking about helium. Helium really only has about -- it is a natural resource that's extracted from the ground, most often as a byproduct with natural gas. And there are really only 6 or 7 major sources in the world. One of the things that, I think, we have done that others have not done is become more backward integrated in the production of helium. And that's dependent on basically the producers of natural gas that, when they're producing natural gas, they also produce helium, and sell it to the industrial gas companies. And some of those natural gas sources have been shut down, creating a squeeze in the availability of helium. So all of our competitors have put customers on allocation, some as low as 50% of their normal need. We hadn't done that until we had to put people on 100% allocation because they were coming to us when they couldn't get supplied by our competitors. So that's caused us to do 100% allocation and then temporarily, an 80% allocation. So we're in pretty good shape on it. But then, helium's going to be scarce commodity. There's a finite amount in the world and we're focused on that, which leads me to just kind of one other point I want to make, as a recent survey done with our customers shows that, when asked the question, \"how do you choose your supplier?\" More than 70% of respondents say that reliability is the most important factor, with the remaining 30% split between price and technology. So it is important for our customers that we remain a reliable supplier.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Jim, what specifically was your Lin\/Lox rates? I know it was running in the low 80s in the previous quarters. Are you still at that level?","James S. Sawyer","It's still running in the low to mid-80s.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Manthey with Robert W. Baird.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","First off, I was just wondering if you could discuss the competitive landscape in China broadly. It seems that the matured geos around the globe have mostly been sorted out, where you have a #1 and #2 player, and that's been determined by competitiveness and then M&A, eventually. How do you view the Praxair China strategy? What's your strongest foothold in that country, by geo or by industry? And if you could just talk about how you see that playing out over the next 5 to 10 years in terms of the overall landscape competitively in China.","James S. Sawyer","Okay. Well, that really brings up our, what we call our density strategy. And because making a high operating profit and a high return on capital in industrial gas is really is a function of having good production and distribution economics, having a lot of customers close to the plants, and also getting byproduct economics between the on-site and emerging businesses. So we have really focused ourselves on 4 -- 3 and then added a fourth region a couple of years ago. The Beijing region, where we have clusters of plants and clusters of customers. The region from Shanghai to Tianjin, where we have the same thing. And then south, in the kind of Daya Bay region, where Sinopec is big, customer. And then we've added the Chongqing region to that 2 years ago, with coal gasification project and merchant liquids there. So we're not going after every project there. There was a recent electronics project, which we really weren't interested in because it was out in the middle of nowhere. We couldn't get synergies with our other customers there. So there -- all 4 industrial gas companies plus Yingde are competing in China. But it's a big country, there are a lot of project opportunities, and we just have to be selective in terms of the ones that will be most profitable to us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","In terms of the cost reduction evaluation for Europe, can you talk about what type of things you can do over there to help improve that business near term?","James S. Sawyer","Right. So I think, as most people know, we did some cost reduction back in 2008, when the big recession came, I think we were probably more effective in North America and South America back then, and less effective in Brazil because you have -- we didn't really want to lose any capacity or ability to meet customer's demands, if demand came back up. Now we've sort of concluded that packaged gas business in Spain and Italy probably will never come back to the levels that it was at earlier in 2000, 2010 decade because there was a lot of stimulus going on with subsidies for highway construction, railway construction, infrastructure and so forth, which resulted in dry packaged gas sales. So what we're focused on is consolidating plants in geographic areas, the fewer plants, that will be the main thing that we'll be doing there.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then for North America, PDI continues to hum along there. Did you see any slowing to any degree in the quarter and when you take a look at the second half of the year, do you see that business moderating or keeping at the same pace?","James S. Sawyer","Oh, I think the sequential growth rate will continue to be fairly strong, maybe not as strong as it was over the past 12 months. But as we get into the third and fourth quarters, when you look at year-on-year comparables, some of that growth is going to start to lap itself, okay? That doesn't mean anything fundamentally different. But when you look at the numbers, they start to lap themselves. But packaged gas demand is strong. One of the things that we're seeing a shift a little bit is that, for a long time, hard goods growth was outpacing gas growth, which was indicating of an expanding demand, but the hard goods growth has much lower margins to it than gas growth. So really not growth we wanted to see. What we did see in the fourth quarter or in the second quarter was higher growth in demand for gases, which is really a pretty healthy development.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Jim, could we revisit the question on productivity that you touched on earlier? Is -- have your triggers for when to do restructurings in each region changed? If you try to parse -- I just want to parse the thinking behind flagging ahead of time possible restructuring actions in different regions, I mean, you usually don't flag ahead of time.","James S. Sawyer","Right. Well, most of the productivity gains, year in and year out, are not really related to macroeconomic situation. They are related to getting more energy efficiency in the plants, more distribution efficiency and more administrative efficiency. So we continue to drive the normal productivity programs. And I would say that there are 3 points that we are focused on this year, which are partially macroeconomic or really macroeconomically driven. So in South America, you've got wage inflation really accelerating and probably growing faster than we can increase prices. So to maintain your margin, you need to kind of shift your operating philosophy to less labor and, consequently, higher sales per employee. So that's kind of the focus in South America and Brazil right now. And then, in Europe, it just doesn't seem to be coming back. As I just mentioned, we see kind of permanently lower demand in the packaged gases in southern Europe. And then in our PST business, which basically has 3 end markets: aerospace, energy and general manufacturing, most of the general manufacturing is in Europe. And that's just been the achilles heel to having PST grow at the rate that it should be growing at. So we're going to take a fresh look at curtailing some plants and production and headcount in PST. But it's really just focused on the European industrial end market, which is very weak.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then also just elaborate on one of the points on how you cope with wage inflation in the U.S. about -- I think it was, what? About 10 years ago, you did a big push to automate and remote-control as many plants as possible. I mean, with the new systems, is there any reason why similar systems would not be applicable around in Asia or Latin America?","James S. Sawyer","Well, that's sort of a continuous process. I mean, we go through -- every 10 years or so, a generation of technology there. But the technology has a better payback in a business, which is a bigger business, okay? And so, we really haven't fully implemented it in anywhere else in the world the same technology that we have implemented in North America. And -- but we are -- we're moving -- we have been doing that and we'll continue to do that. And basically, it's plant control systems which allow you to start up and shut down the plant without losing much energy efficiency. It's about being able to shift production from one plant to another, depending on the power cost in one location versus another, when you have lots of plants, like we do in North America, that's a very fine tuning thing. When you have few plants, then it's not that much opportunity there. And then, lastly, in distribution economics, it's really state-of-the-art logistics planning tools. And so there's always room for improvement there.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison with First Analysis.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Just looking at the Asia -- the operating margin in Asia, if we exclude that gain on sale, looks like operating margin declined. And I guess I would've expected, given the poor performance of  electronics, that you that you would have actually had a positive mix benefit because electronics are typically lower margin? Can you just help us understand what was going on with those margin dynamics?","James S. Sawyer","Yes, I think you just explained it pretty clearly. The electronics is pulling down the margin and, particularly, argon sales to photovoltaic manufacturers and the price of argon are pulling it down. But the sort of non-electronics end markets have much higher margins, and also have significantly higher volume growth rates. You might have also cited it and kind of a disappointing volume growth rate is because we had positive volumes outside of electronics and negative volumes in electronics.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Got it. And then can you talk a little bit, Jim, about how the Air Products acquisition of Endura maybe changes the competitive dynamics in South America for you?","James S. Sawyer","I don't think it will change the competitive dynamics at all. We certainly -- we know that we own [indiscernible] the way had kind of an inside track on that. But when it went to public auction, we just could not get anywhere near into the prices that were being offered by [indiscernible] Air Products, especially when you look inside the company and you look at what plants they have and what capacity they have and what contracts they have and significant part of the business is selling nuts and bolts and stuff. So we shied away at that price. But we've got strong businesses in the major countries that Endura operates. A #1 share in Peru and Colombia and a #2 share in Chile. And yes, we're very-- optimistic and positive about the outlook for new on-site projects in those areas. And so tellingly, it's -- I don't see any change happening to our business as a result of it.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And just maybe lastly, one of your competitors commented on seeing some steel industry weakness that was impacting their liquid argon volumes in North America. Are you guys seeing anything like that?","James S. Sawyer","No. Well, it's just that -- that's a circular logic. The -- we have much higher -- we were the #1 producer of argon in North America by a long shot, okay? And we have more diverse production of argon amongst different plants. Whereas some of our competitors have really just make argon out of a couple of plants. And so, those would be plants that they're not -- if they're not operating, they're not making any argon, okay. So I know, and we're both -- our competitors are saying they would've made more money if they had more helium to sell, more argon to sell, but they didn't. Because they didn't plan ahead to make sure they had that capacity.","Operator","The next question comes the next question comes from the line of John McNulty with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just 2 quick questions. First of all, when you think -- when you add up like the competitive advantages versus maybe the cost and inflation issues, when you think about the profitability on projects, how does Brazil compare with the rest of your platforms, say, North America and Asia? In terms of like, returns?","James S. Sawyer","Yes, well, I would say in terms of new project investments, we use the same hurdle rates, maybe a little currency adjusted or interest rate adjusted, country by country. But there's a wide range. Where we're doing projects that are smaller kind of projects, where -- what I call we get a lot of synergy between the old business and the new business, we can get 20%, 30% IRRs on those projects, okay? So Brazil really has a large share of projects that look light. Other projects, which would tend to be more standalone or very large projects, tend to be more competitive and more in kind of the low to mid-teens in terms of IRRs. But that's -- that's kind of the same story around the world.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. And then just with regard to your -- the RFPs you've said were starting to really heat up in the U.S. Can you give us more color where they're coming from? I know you mentioned the Vale contract that you got. But what other areas should we be thinking about in terms of where this demand is really picking up?","James S. Sawyer","Okay. I would say the mining sector is certainly one, with nickel and copper and gold prices high some of the North American miners are expanding. And there are also new process technologies that are environmentally cleaner than -- but also use oxygen in the processing technology. So mining sector is one, and then the chemical sector is another. There are probably about 20 potential, and I use the word potential, chemical project expansions in North America. A lot of ethylene oxide and so forth. So those 2 end markets are where we would be looking to -- where we're seeing increased proposal activity for on-site projects.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Kelcey, I think you talked about the packaged gas trends and I wasn't sure if you can give a little more color between Germany and what's going on in southern Italy. Was it uniform erosion or was it better in the North than the South?","James S. Sawyer","Yes, it's better in the North than the South. It's kind of a -- history has always been that way. But basically, the weakest is Spain, the second weakest is Italy, third is France, Germany is pretty even. And then Scandinavia is growing.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And in the North American markets, Jim, have you seen as the rigs are sort of shifting away from dry into wetter gas, does that create challenges or benefits for you guys?","James S. Sawyer","Oh, it creates both, okay. So the frac-ing business for dry gas is practically, completely gone, okay? And that's a bit of hurt to us. But in the so-called wet gas, which has a lot of natural gas liquids and coal bed methane up in Canada, it's strengthening.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And if I might just last one, can you source crude helium from offshore and refine it here, or if you were get some from Qatar, elsewhere, would you bring in finished helium?","James S. Sawyer","No. We have a rather small -- we do have a contract from Qatar, and we do bring in some helium from Qatar, as well as all of our North American sources. But the problem is, and I don't think specifically that Qatar is that you've always buying it -- if they're not making natural gas, they're not going to be making helium, okay? So you get in this bind where you're committed to providing product to your customer but your supply source gets interrupted. So you don't want to be too dependent on any one supply source. But it's definitely economics to ship it around the world. I mean, we actually export a lot of helium out of North America to Asia.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Gauley [ph] of Gauley [ph] and Associates.","Unknown Analyst","In past currency cycles in Brazil, you've been able to offset currency weakness with some pretty big price increases. Why is that not working quite as well at this juncture?","James S. Sawyer","Well, there's always a lag on that. And -- which happened over prior decades, it seems like every 10 years there some kind of devaluation, which is followed by inflation and followed by us increasing price. This has not been that kind of case yet, but we are getting price up on most of our contracts. But it's going to take some time because customers aren't doing that well because of the recession, and it always takes some time to get it up. So we will get it -- we will get price increases but it takes time to offset the devaluation.","Unknown Analyst","As a follow-up, with respect to your Gulf Coast hydrogen network, are lower natural gas prices and therefore, lower hydrogen prices, is that big enough to move the needle in terms of R&M margins for your customers?","James S. Sawyer","Well, I think -- I think that with low natural gas prices, low hydrogen prices, what their spending on hydrogen as compared to what their spending on crude oil tends to be a smaller amount, okay? And so, when they do their optimization of the refinery, in terms of looking at inputs and outputs, that gives them more degrees of freedom in how much hydrogen they would use. But yes it  could also expand their margins a little bit.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Jim, just on your backlog, it was down in the quarter by a couple of hundred million dollars. If what see on new plant startups and potential new contract signings, should that backlog by year-end be flat up or down from current levels?","James S. Sawyer","Okay, that's a good question. Basically the backlog was down a couple of hundred million dollars because we started up more projects than we signed during the quarter, okay? And there'll be quarters where it'll go either direction. Now -- but that's kind of what's going into the backlog, what's coming out of the backlog or, I guess, what's the proposal activity remains to be strong. We think that the long-term growth around the world hasn't changed at all. But certainly, in Brazil, with the recession, we've seen a pause in decision-making, which is small compared to what we saw in 2009 and 2010 where we didn't sign very many contracts. But I think that long term, those projects will still be there. Now we're also seeing some delay in the startups of what's in the backlog with some customers who just aren't getting ready to take the product when the project was supposed to start. So some of that is going to stretch some of those 2013 startups into 2014.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's helpful. And Jim, just on pricing in Europe, given the weakness of the end markets, how much longer can you get pricing as volumes are down or weak?","James S. Sawyer","Well, I think we're the only ones in Europe who are focused in pricing, at least positive pricing. And we did get positive pricing this quarter and we're going to continue to try to do that.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just lastly, U.S. packaged gas sales are higher than air gas. Is that due to your helium activity that's not being constrained, do you think? Or are you gaining share?","James S. Sawyer","We had more acquisition activity and we had higher same-store sales growth. So I can't speak for them. But I think that we're all -- we've got our eyes focused on the selling process and the acquisition process and a pretty good pipeline going there. So with that, we'd like to take one more question.","Operator","The final question will from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just quickly, Jim, you talked about hedging in against the Brazilian real. Can you talk about what kind of hedges do you have in place for second half and what impact do you expect from them?","James S. Sawyer","Okay. With the accounting the way that it is, we really can't hedge that income because you can't get hedge accounting on hedging net income, which means that you really can't hedge across quarter-end, you have to mark everything to market. So we really kind of pretty much reduced our net income hedging to practically nothing.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, we talked about strong volumes in North America in packaged gases. You mentioned automotive OEM had a strong end market. Are there any signs that you are seeing that -- in automotive OEM, or other areas where U.S. is beginning to slow down due to the woes in Europe?","James S. Sawyer","No, we haven't seen any slowdown in volumes there. And I think there's a whole range of industries. I use automotive OEM as an example. But there's machinery industries, farm and equipment industries, mining equipment that are driving metal fabrication and welding. And maybe won't be too long before we start to see a bottoming out in nonresidential construction, which could also be a positive help in the future. Okay. Well that is the end of our call. We've run out of time, but we thank you again for participating in our second quarter earnings call. Our third quarter earnings call will be held on October 24.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Kelcey Hoyt, Director-Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Kelcey E. Hoyt - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Candice. Good morning and thank you for attending our second quarter earnings call and webcast. I'm joined this morning by Matt White, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Liz Hirsch, our Vice President and Controller.","Today's presentation materials are available on our website at praxair.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference.","In addition, please note that our discussion of earnings for the second quarter, including year-over-year and sequential comparison excludes charges taken this quarter related to cost reduction actions. The reconciliation to the U.S. GAAP reported numbers are in the appendix to this presentation and the press release.","Matt and I will now review Praxair's second quarter results, including the current business environment and updated earnings guidance. We'll then be available to answer questions.","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Kelcey, and good morning, everyone. The global macroeconomic backdrop continues to be quite challenging across major end markets. The combination of fiscal uncertainty, volatile commodity pricing and devaluing foreign currencies has constrained industrial demand and thus our customers' production activity.","This American economy continues to soften as the government limit spending, while fighting inflationary pressures. In North America, we are seeing more negative effects from the curtailment of energy investing, as well as the rapidly appreciating U.S. dollar. And in Asia, the Chinese economy continues to decelerate as it absorbs excess industrial capacity.","The culmination of all of this, result in our year-over-year sales decreasing by 12% this quarter. 9% of the drop is from weaker foreign currencies, another 2% from lower natural gas pass-through. This leaves underlying sales lower by 1% from the second quarter of 2014, as a 1% price improvement is more than offset by a 2% volume decline.","The drivers behind the decline are cyclical in nature. We've seen down cycles before and they eventually recover. However, since it's not clear when they will recover, an important question is what are we doing about it? While we can't control FX rates or the underlying volumes tied to economic conditions, we can manage other aspects of the business to preserve and grow shareholder value.","We are raising price to recover the affects of cost inflation. We achieved 1% global pricing improvement, driven by North and South America, which will support our earnings going forward. We are prudently managing costs to better align our organization with underlying business trends. In this quarter, we took $146 million charge, which included severance for approximately 5% of our global work force, in addition to consolidation or exit of certain business operations.","We expect the actions to be substantially complete by the end of 2015, with annualized savings of about $75 million per year, starting in the fourth quarter. The combined price and cost actions have further improved the quality of the business as evidenced by higher operating and EBITDA margins at 22.9% and 33.4%, respectively.","In addition to the income statement, we are increasing focus on the balance sheet. More disciplined asset management has led to higher free cash flow, enabling us to return over $400 million to shareholders this quarter, while investing for long-term growth and reducing our net debt. And we expect to continue these efforts, as we just announced this morning a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program.","So regardless or current economic conditions, we continue to position the business for long-term growth, while remaining a reliable steward of shareholder capital.","I'd now like to hand it off to Kelcey to walk through the financial results.","Kelcey E. Hoyt - Director-Investor Relations","Please turn to slide number 3 for our consolidated results. Overall sales and operating profit this quarter were 1% below the prior year, and EPS grew 2%, excluding negative foreign currency translation impact and cost pass-through.","Sales for the quarter were $2.7 billion. Year-over-year price attainment of 1% was driven primarily by North and South America. Volumes declined 2% as new project contribution was more than offset by weaker underlying industrial activity in Brazil and China, as well as weaker energy, metals, and manufacturing end markets in the United States.","Sequentially, organic sales growth was steady, with most segments in line with or modestly positive, including price, to the first quarter. Operating profit was $626 million. Excluding currency impact, operating profit was 1% below the prior-year period as benefits from higher price were more than offset by lower volumes.","As such, during the quarter, we took incremental cost-reduction actions, primarily in emerging markets to rightsize the cost base and align the organization with the current environment.","Our employees' ability to continually deliver strong productivity, cost control and price grew our EBITDA margin 130 basis points, to 33.4%. And the operating margin 50 basis points to a record 22.9%. Earnings per share of $1.45 increased 2% year-over-year ex-currency. EPS benefited from a 2% reduction in the number of diluted shares outstanding as a result of net repurchases of common stock.","During the quarter, we repurchased $217 million of stock, net of issuances, or about 2.1 million shares. About $500 million remains available under the current authorized share repurchase program. And this morning we announced the authorization of an additional $1.5 billion share repurchase program, bringing the total available for repurchases to about $2 billion. This is our fifth share repurchase program initiated since 2007.","And as you can see on slide 12, our consistently strong operating cash flow generation has enabled us to return significant amounts of cash to shareholders in the form of annually increasing dividends as well as share repurchases that have reduced the diluted shares outstanding each year. We expect that strong cash flow generation and subsequent cash returns to shareholders will continue throughout the various economic cycles.","Cash flow from operations was $707 million or 26% of sales and funded $352 million of capital expenditures. The company paid $205 million of dividends and repurchased $217 million of stock net of issuances. This aligns with our capital allocation strategy of funding growth and shareholder returns from cash flow. Our after-tax return on capital this quarter remains stable at 12.6% and return on equity was strong at 30.5%.","Our project backlog, which we define as projects with CapEx greater than $5 million and associated with a fully executed customer supply contract, decreased from $2.1 billion in the first quarter to $1.7 billion in the second quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by projects in North America, both the start-up and positive resolution of an energy project in the United States. This energy project has been delayed several years by the customers' lack of a permit. Working collaboratively with the energy customer, we terminated our hydrogen supply agreement and sold the fixed assets under construction to the customer. We did not have a gain or a loss on the settlement.","Geographically, our current backlog CapEx is about 40% weighted towards North America, about 30% in Asia, and the remaining 30% for customers in South America and Europe. These projects will serve a diverse set of end markets, including energy, chemicals, manufacturing, electronics, and metals. Ongoing project bidding globally remains active in downstream energy and petrochemical end markets.","Please turn to slide 4 for our results in North America. Sales in North America were $1.5 billion, 9% below the prior-year quarter. 8% of the decline, was driven by lower cost pass-through, largely lower natural gas prices passed through the hydrogen customers and negative currency translation in Canada and Mexico, two countries which comprise more than a quarter of the North American sales.","Organic sales were 1% below the prior year as price attainment in merchant and packaged gas was offset by volume declines. Volume growth to food and beverage and refinery customers was more than offset by year-over-year declines to metals, upstream energy and manufacturing customers. Overall, on-site volumes were steady year-over-year, with solid demand from chemical and refining customers, offset by weaker sales to metals customers, who have been impacted by lower price of commodities and strength of the U.S. dollar.","North American packaged gas organic sales were lower year-over-year, as stable gas volumes were more than offset by weaker hard goods, primarily related to upstream energy customers. Sequentially, North American organic sales were steady as growth in merchant carbon dioxide to food and beverage customers and hydrogen to refineries was offset by weaker metals and hard goods volumes. North American operating profit was $388 million, consistent with the prior-year quarter, excluding negative currency translation impact.","Price, productivity and cost reduction actions offset the impact of lower volumes. Segment operating margin was strong at 26.2%. During the quarter, we continued to build out density in North America by strengthening our carbon dioxide network and acquiring three U.S. packaged gas distributors. Praxair has signed a long-term agreement to purchase crude carbon dioxide from an existing refinery customer.","Praxair will build, own and operate a 450 ton per day carbon dioxide purification and liquefaction plant, producing beverage-quality liquid carbon dioxide for distribution into the Northeast U.S. market. This new carbon dioxide source, which will begin serving food and beverage and other customers in 2016, further strengthens Praxair's supply position as well as developing a sustainable use of byproduct carbon dioxide.","We still see a healthy pipeline of activity for U.S. packaged gas distributor acquisitions, although potential targets are smaller in size. During the quarter, we acquired three independent distributors of industrial and specialty packaged gases in California, Texas and Maryland with combined 2014 annual sales of about $10 million.","Now please turn to page 5 for our results in Europe. Sales in Europe were $331 million, 19% below the prior-year quarter. Ex-currency and cost pass-through, organic sales growth was 1% below the prior year as growth in manufacturing, food and beverage and healthcare was offset by lower energy end market sales in Northern Europe. Sequentially, organic sales growth of 3% was driven by growth in most countries and end markets and includes a new project startup in Russia. Operating profit of $63 million was steady with the prior-year quarter excluding currency translation, as price and productivity offset the impact of lower volumes. The operating margin remained solid at 19%.","Page 6 shows our results in South America. South American segment sales were $388 million, 3% above the prior-year quarter ex-currency and cost pass-through. Strong price of 7% year-over-year included significant recovery of high inflation in the region.","While South America volumes declined 4% year-over-year, the business again outperformed estimated quarterly industrial production of negative 8%. The local team continues to capture growth in non-cyclical end markets, such as healthcare, and through application technology-driven sales, which was more than offset by lower volumes to manufacturing and metals customers. Sequential volume declines were also driven primarily by metals and manufacturing end markets.","Operating profit in South America was $81 million, in line with the prior-year quarter excluding foreign currency impact, as price gains were offset by lower volumes and higher power costs.","Our local employees continue to take action in both pricing and cost reduction to preserve the operating profit and cash flow generation of the South American business. As a result, we fully expect the profitability to improve when the economy does recover.","Please turn to slide 7 for our results in Asia. Asia sales for the quarter were $387 million, with organic growth of 1% year-over-year. We continue to see mid to high-single digit volume growth in India and Korea, including growth from new plant startups, primarily to metals and electronics customers.","China volume growth continues to decelerate due to slowing industrial activity in most end markets. Sequentially, volumes grew 6%, which includes rebound from the seasonal Lunar New Year impact and new project contribution. Price was steady year-over-year, as increases in Korea and India were offset by continued price pressure in China.","Asia's operating profit was $69 million, lower than the prior-year quarter, primarily due to negative currency translation and a prior-year insurance recovery benefit of $4 million. As industrial activity has continued to decelerate, primarily in China, we have taken incremental cost reduction actions in Asia in the second quarter to better align the cost base with volume trends.","Our results for Surface Technologies are shown on page 8. Surface Technology sales for the quarter were $150 million, 6% below the prior year excluding currency. During the second quarter, organic sales to the energy end market, which is about a quarter of the sales for the segment, were lower year-over-year.","In addition, while aerospace sales grew organically by 2%, this was partially offset by customer plant interruptions, which impacted our volumes. The customers are currently back up and running, but not yet back to expected run rates.","Operating profit of $25 million decreased versus the prior-year quarter due to negative foreign currency translation and lower volume partially offset by cost control.","And now I'll turn the call back to Matt to discuss our earnings guidance.","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Please turn to slide 9. Looking to the third quarter, we are calling for an EPS guidance range of $1.42 to $1.49. This includes an estimated 12% negative impact from foreign currencies. At this point, we aren't anticipating much volume improvement between second quarter and third quarter, although we will start seeing cost benefits from our recent restructuring action by the fourth quarter.","For full year, we've adjusted our guidance downward to a range of $5.80 to $5.95. You can see the EPS walk comparing this to our guidance last quarter. South American volumes continue to decline across major industrial end markets. And North American manufacturing is softening, especially in the U.S., as the effects of lower oil and a stronger dollar are starting to work through the manufacturing base.","Clearly, we're disappointed in the need to adjust guidance again, but the first half of 2015 has been challenging to say the least. Broad-based declines across virtually every commodity class has significantly dampened capital investments from our customers and rippled through the entire supply chain. Emerging market growth continues to soften, with certain countries experiencing recessionary like conditions. Most governments have been focused on improving their balance sheet and thus reducing infrastructure investments. All these macro events have negatively shaped and influenced the investment confidence of our customer base and, hence, slowed growth trends.","However, there are reasons to be confident going forward. We have a strong team of dedicated employees who know how to manage through these cycles. Our organization has and will continue to respond to tough times. And the proof is in our results. We expect to continue to improve upon our industry-leading results now and going forward.","In addition, these global macroeconomic issues are a natural part of the economic cycle. We sell into a wide variety of industries and applications and they tend to move with general economic trends. And right now, we're in a down cycle. So we are focusing on the basics, managing what we can control, and positioning ourselves for a strong recovery. We know how to do this as evidenced by our history. And when the economic cycle recovers, we'll emerge as a stronger and even higher quality company.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from Don Carson of Susquehanna. Your line is now open.","Don D. Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you. Matt, on slide 11, you show your margin trends since 2008. And obviously, you've had very good trends this year, even with a slowdown in business. So wondering how much of the improvement in operating and EBITDA margins you would attribute to lower natural gas pass-through, particularly in North America?","And then also looking at these margin trends, what do you think the implications are when volumes do turn? Do you have to bring some cost back into the business? Or should operating leverage increase these margins?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So first, Don, on the natural gas impact, I think you can actually go back and calculate those from what we've disclosed in prior presentations. But just focusing now on kind of the current quarter, a portion of the improvement was due to natural gas, but we also picked up probably an extra 10 basis points or so just on price actions and cost actions. So we still are getting what I'll call real improvement in the operating and EBITDA margins, despite, as you can imagine, every time you lose volume that takes away at a pretty heavy margin. So you need to do things around cost, price to make that up. And I think our teams around the world have done a great job on that.","And I think your second question, if you can repeat that again?","Don D. Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yeah. Just wondering when volumes do start to recover, what are the implications for operating leverage? Or do you think you have to bring additional cost back into the business to capture those volumes? Just wondering how much ability you have just to load up existing business?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. So I think regarding that one, clearly, we have capacity. So we're not going to need to add capacity. We still have the drivers making the deliveries. We still have the tanks that are at our customers' site, and we still have the pipelines connected to our customers. So when the molecules flow at a greater rate, it's going to be the same cost infrastructure used to deliver them. So I do expect us to see some pretty good margin accretion.","The one area where \u2013 if you're below MTOPs, obviously, you don't get to really get that impact until you go above the MTOPs. So there'll be some pockets in South America will need to cross over the MTOP levels. But aside from that, I think merchant and package it's highly accretive right when it happens. And on on-site, once you pass the MTOPs. But we really don't need to add many costs back to achieve that.","Don D. Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mike Sison of KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, Matt. Hi, Kelcey.","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hi, Mike.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","You know, Matt, it's been, wow, probably since 2008, 2009 we've seen down volumes for Praxair. You gave us a couple of reasons why. Can you maybe walk through some of the distribution channels? I wonder if tonnage is \u2013 are customers getting down to the 70% level? Or are you worried about customers idling plants at this point?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, Mike. So you're right. I mean, you're probably going back to 2009. I think when we look across this year, we still do expect, on a volume basis, kind of flat to maybe slightly up. So this quarter was a little bit more of a difficult comp, but clearly, negative 2% on volume. We still are getting some positive contribution on projects, but that's offset by even more erosion on some of the base.","And when you look around the world, probably half of this erosion was North America. And the main elements of that, a little over a third is on-site, when you back out the impact of new projects, a lot of that's metals. And we had a strong metals last year. We saw a big soft patch on the pipeline here this second quarter. We are seeing that pick up a bit in the third quarter. So hopefully that should improve here sequentially, but that was a big driver.","In addition, in North America, the merchant that's serving upstream energy, as well as metals \u2013 we serve a lot of argon into stainless steel and liquid oxygen that would go as supplemental oxygen for carbon steel plants, and that is lower.","And in addition, hard goods were lower in North America, high-single digits. And part of that is we have a lot of large equipment sales, mostly in upstream energy last year. And we're seeing that really soften, the equipment sales. And as you can imagine, we're only going to sell hard goods when it makes economic sense for us. We're a gas player and the hard goods are complementary. So there is some business that if it just doesn't make economic sense for us, we're not serving. But we're definitely seeing some slowdown in hard goods.","South America is driving almost a full percent of the volume globally, and that's just due to the function of the economic situation there. As Kelcey had mentioned, we are doing better than the underlying IP, but it's still quite negative. So that's also putting a drag.","And then finally, I'd say Asia is just not growing, China specifically, at the rate we're normally used to. We've seen some positive improvement on merchant, but really, we're still in the process of doing more direct merchant sales and less distributor. And our on-sites were a little slower this quarter here. We had an outage or two, but that was also dragging a bit on that growth.","So I think some of these things are just on-site customers that are either managing their inventories or taking lower volumes. Some are more specific to the energy market, with some of the liquid that was going upstream. But I expect it should get a little bit better here in the back half, but we're not anticipating by a lot, frankly.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then just one quick follow-up, I think one positive is you're able to get pricing in this environment, which is pretty impressive. Could you maybe talk about the initiatives there and why in most areas that continues to be a plus for you?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. Clearly, the biggest contributor of price being South America right now. You're seeing a lot of inflation as the government is continually trying to combat that inflation, whether its wage inflation, power inflation, across the board. So we've got pretty strong contracts and a team down there that knows how to recover that inflation. So that is something that's driving our price. We're also seeing some good opportunities still in North America. We've had a few price announcements here recently. And for the most part, they are sticking. So I think that aspect is good. China is still very challenged. And I think in Europe, we're starting to see some positive momentum. You look at our Europe segment is being a little dampened by our energy business. But peeling that out, we're starting to see some good traction in Europe, each quarter a little bit better than the last both in volume and price.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from John Roberts of UBS. Your line is now open.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Morning, Liz.","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Morning, John.","Elizabeth T. Hirsch - Vice President & Controller","Hi, John.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Was the U.S. energy project divestment, is there a trend there or something we might learn from that particular transaction?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No. No. It's very unique. And maybe I can comment a little more on that. So we initiated this contract over eight years ago, and we went into this arrangement with a concept of building our density as we do and a model that we could build out and essentially establish the type of supply that we normally do.","Due to reasons unrelated to us, frankly, customers permitting issue, this delayed for seven, eight years and our equipment essentially was in storage, we had been receiving some progress in recovery payments to sort of help recover our lost time value money. But now the permit's finally been issued, it is modified. And the scope has been changed on this project. And basically, the original project that we had signed up for is just not feasible from our perspective.","So we had worked with the customer, and we felt this was in the best interest in the use of this capital was to go ahead and exercise this opportunity to sell the asset back to the customer. So a very unique situation, I mean, clearly, U.S.-based downstream energy type project is something you would want, today's environment for growth. There's no doubt about that. But I think, as you could imagine, John, we really researched this and analyzed it, thought long and hard about it over the last several years. But we firmly are confident that this is the best use of shareholder capital was to go ahead and exercise this opportunity here the way we did.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","And then as a follow up, you've got a backlog of $1.7 billion, and CapEx of $1.6 billion, roughly the same. Do you expect them to trend stable together for the next few quarters and track each other? Or maybe backlog trends up first and CapEx trends down a little bit? Or how would you see them playing out?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, I think from a CapEx perspective, depending upon the timing of where the projects are, I still think this kind of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion and, hence, we're saying $1.6 billion number, seems to be where we're at given the backlog of projects, although we are taking some actions on non-large growth projects to maybe trim a little more.","As far as the backlog, as you know, it's lumpy. We still have some pretty solid leads mostly on downstream either energy or petchem type projects that we're pursuing. They are a little bit larger. So if they are executed and signed, they could create some lumpiness on the upside.","And as far as the downside on the backlog, we've got two more projects that'll be starting up here this year. And then into next year, we have several more coming on stream. So all-in, I still think $1.5 billion to $2 billion on the backlog for the remainder of this year. And then I think CapEx will probably be in the lower end of that range, just given the spend rate.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC","Hi, guys. This is Dan Rizzo in for Laurence. Just to return to that energy products divestiture, what kind of operating cash flow or embedded CapEx could we think about being associated with that project?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, we didn't disclose that number. But I think if you look at the dip in the project backlog, there were three projects that came out this quarter. That one was by far the largest. In our investing cash flow, there was a divestiture line that comprised a large component of this settlement. As I had mentioned before, there were some prior payments over the last eight years. But in the end of the day, it was an energy project that we essentially just sold out from and you can kind of look at the numbers and figure it out.","Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC","All right. Thanks. And then given the shale build-out of the U.S. over the next couple of years, how should we be thinking about CapEx in 2016 and 2017, be lower or higher or equal to 2015?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, specific to the Gulf in the U.S., I expect the opportunities are still fairly strong. When you look globally for us, clearly there'll be some softening in places like China, South America. We're just not seeing large capital projects in places like Europe either. So on a global basis, I would expect it to be a little bit lower. But in the Gulf and in some other pockets of the world in downstream energy, as I mentioned earlier, we are seeing some good opportunities still. And that's a lot of either national oil companies or independent oil companies looking to take advantage of low-cost feedstock, whether it be oil or, in the petchem side, could be shale.","So I think from that perspective, it's still pretty good opportunities in the Gulf. And I do expect projects related to U.S. Gulf or energy and chemicals will probably make a larger percentage up of our backlog than it does today.","Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC","All right. Thank you, guys.","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, Matt and Liz.","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hey, David.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Matt, just on the pricing, you announced a 10% price increase roughly January 1. You announced a 15% price increase June 1. Obviously, you don't get all these price increases in on the bulk side; they take years to fully implement. Can you help us think about how these combined pretty lofty price increases will flow through? Is it 1% to 2% per year? Is it higher? Just help us on the pricing issue.","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. I think, David, when you look at North America, say, when we talk about price, we're really talking about merchant and package. So while the denominator is the entire sales of the segment, the actual price itself in the numerator is just for those two portions of the business. So the first thing you could probably do, and this is all disclosed information, but you can kind of back into what the price is just on the two distribution methods that it applies to.","And then when looking at that, you're exactly right. I mean, we are a contractual business. So pricing will be applied to where contracts allow. And you'll have a hit rate that can vary, depending upon regions and contracts and markets. But we are usually able to always get a few percent out of each price increase that we announce. And that's kind of how our stick rate's been over our history.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. And just on the cost action, Matt, I think you targeted $30 million of the $75 million in Brazil. What's your expectation for Brazil going forward? Is it shrinking this year? Or is it your expectation it shrinks next year as well? Are these cost actions reflective of just, obviously, a lower growth, if not declining economy going forward?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. So really that's if you can imagine a macro kind of question as the macros are really what are having Brazil struggle. But from our just best guess at this point \u2013 and I was just down there about a month ago, clearly, 2015 is challenged. The view is that there's not a lot of optimism around 2016 yet at this point. Inflation is the big culprit they're really trying to get after. And they just recently made a change here and their fiscal deficit had to sort of step it down. But they are going after the government balance sheet and I think that part is positive. They're just not getting the tax revenue base.","So when you add all these pieces together, I just don't think the confidence is yet there. Clearly, the confidence on the current ruling party is quite low right now. So I think that is creating a challenge for investors to want to invest at this point. Now, the reais has gotten fairly weak here. And so that does make exporting beneficial for those that can do it today.","So my best guess at this point is I'm not really expecting a lot out of Brazil the rest of this year or into 2016. We're kind of thinking it may just hold flat. But if they can continue to take the actions they're taking, it should bode well for them to start stimulating the economy back end of 2016 possibly. It just remains to be seen. But the SELIC rate is quite high right now. So they have a lot of room to stimulate, they just are not comfortable with their inflation situation. And I agree with that.","So we're going to have to wait and see. But we're not waiting in terms of our rightsizing the organization. We're aligning it more with the near-term outlook, which is muted, and we're just rightsizing the organization around this. But when things recover, we won't miss anything. We're still very, very well positioned to capture more than our fair share when things recover.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thank you very much.","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Sam Darkatsh of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, Matt, Kelcey and Liz. How are you?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning, Sam.","Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Many of my questions have been asked and answered. A couple of clarifications ones, Matt, when you and Steve have talked in the past about projects having been in dispute, was this what you were referring to specifically, the backlog project that you're announcing has been divested? Was that what you were referring to?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes.","Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And by my \u2013 I just want to make sure my math is correct. China, you're mentioning is decelerating, but it would appear at least though that the volumes are running down high single. Is that how we should look at it? Or is there a different way you're classifying the volumes when you're talking about China?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. I think you got to peel out the project start-ups, as they may be a little different than the underlying economic trends. But at least what I'm seeing when I look at China, you're kind of low-single digit, maybe mid-single digit in certain parts of the country right now is what we're seeing on the ground.","And I think what you've got going on there is a lot of the very large growth opportunities in either infrastructure, anything upstream whether it's steel, mining, construction, those are clearly softer and they were driving a lot of the growth.","Downstream is still okay whether it's consumer related, environmental, food, healthcare. But those are just not as intensive in terms of gas usage. So what I would characterize it as is we're still seeing good growth in these more consumer downstream opportunities. And we signed that CNOOC deal last quarter, I think as evidence. But the upstream side is definitely softer and there's just, frankly, excess capacity. I mean, that's one of the main issues is there's just too much capacity and it needs to be soaked up.","Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Final question if I could, and this is going to be an odd question, I guess, to ask on quarterly conference call. But I guess we're all trying to figure where the base level of business might get to, to figure out where things might stabilize. If you ended up keeping all else equal and all of your long-term contractual business went to take-or-pay levels, would the overall company be earning its cost of capital, keeping everything else equal?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, a third of our business is on-site. So that third has the take-or-pay levels. The other two-thirds are merchant and packaged. So they would be requirements contracts, but not all of them by any means have any take-or-pay form.","But I'll answer it this way. I feel quite good about our on-site projection in down environments. And I think if you want to use history as an example, just look in 2009 when things really fell. I mean, really fell, and they really fell fast, as you may recall. And we were pretty resilient. And a lot of that were the contracts, a lot of that was the protection in the on-site. So I feel fine on that front. And I think you're seeing it play out in Brazil today. We're still maintaining a pretty high quality business in what several are calling some of the worst conditions in over two decades. So I feel okay on that.","Now, the merchant and package, clearly that's going to be a little more exposed, especially the package in terms of what's going on in the environment. So I'm not sure if that answers your question, but that's about the best way I can characterize it.","Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. I could certainly re-ask that question offline, but that is very helpful. Thank you, Matt. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone.","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Morning, Bob.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Matt, I'm just curious, as the sort of the transition of some of these emerging markets maybe away from some of the commodity boom of the past decade as they mature, do you see the multiplier on your business or in the industry in general changing at all? Or do you think, as you've done in the Western economies where you get other avenues of growth, you can still continue to grow at some multiplier GDP?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, I think, Bob \u2013 and that is a good question. I think the multiplier is a function of this intensity per capita concept, right. That really helps drive a higher multiplier in terms of gas pull-through on the growth. And in the emerging markets, they still have fairly low levels of gas intensity per capita. You just see it in the results and you see it when you go to those countries in terms of how their \u2013 the lack of application technology that's being deployed.","So I still think the multipliers are quite strong in those regions. I just think the challenge you're seeing in a lot of emerging markets today is the investments are just simply not being made. All right so people made investments in some of these markets and the capacities are lower than they expect, so they're just running with existing capacity or, in some cases, just not running that capacity and that's the bigger challenge.","But you look at certain countries that still have significant infrastructure needs and they're just putting a lot of that on hold to try and get the government balance sheet corrected. When they get back to a situation of addressing those infrastructure needs, I think you'll see that multiple back in play, and we should be in pretty good shape in terms of gas pull-through.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. And I know you can't and wouldn't talk specifically about any competitors. But I'm just wondering if you could \u2013 have you seen any change in the bidding activity? You've got a domestic competitor that's got a culture change going on. Maybe you've got some European competitors that have weak currency benefits. The industry is in a lull. Have you sensed any change in competitive dynamics as those fewer, maybe more worthy or more exciting projects that are still left out there are put up for bid, has that changed the intensity around it?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, I think, Bob, there's only been a few data points, given the geographies that we participate in. And I'd say at this point, there's nothing I can really point to, to say either direction I've seen anything materially different. But we'll probably just need more evidence and more time to just understand that.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for the help.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mike Harrison of Global Hunter Securities. Your line is now open.","Michael J. Harrison - Global Hunter Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Morning, Mike.","Michael J. Harrison - Global Hunter Securities LLC","Matt, was wondering if you can talk a little bit about what's driving the strength in the food and beverage market? It's been a little while since we got an update on how you're leveraging the new CO2 business. I know they had some opportunities in beer as well as in Latin America. Are those starting to come to fruition?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes. In fact, Mike, we're taking not just the growth in new CO2 in the U.S. and expanding it in other applications and leveraging our packaged business to support that. But we're deploying that model in other countries. So South America, Mexico and some other parts of the world, we're really trying to duplicate some of those efforts and leveraging our strong CO2 supply network and very strong food and beverage application technology.","So we're doing that to continue to grow. We are seeing some opportunistic acquisitions that we've done in LATAM around food. So I think that's been a good driver for us. And it's something that has a nice sort of Brazilian noncyclical aspect that meshes well with our portfolio and meshes well with our application expertise.","So we've been quite happy with that. And Kelcey mentioned in the prepared remarks another CO2 supply that we've acquired here in the U.S. and that'll further help some of our synergies and our growth opportunities in that market.","Michael J. Harrison - Global Hunter Securities LLC","And then I had a couple things to ask about the steel outlook. It sounds like you're a little bit more positive on what's going on in North America on the dynamics. But could you just walk through kind of each region and what you see in terms of trends or anything \u2013 any positive signs region to region? And then are you seeing any impact from weaker steel demand on supply and demand balance for argon?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Okay. So first I'll talk about the base carbon steel. Just on North America as well, while I feel a little better this quarter, we were coming off some pretty low lows in Q2. So I think it's \u2013 while the sequential I feel a little better on, whether there are levels that we've seen or normalized levels remains to be seen. But it does appear to be better so far. I think Q2, there were just more customer outages and excess inventory overhang.","Looking at South America, it's hard to say. I think the only \u2013 auto is still very weak in South America. Infrastructure projects, as I mentioned, are just not happening. So whether it's long steel, flat steel, there's just not very much demand. I think one positive aspect is the way that currencies are going, especially when you look at a country like Brazil. Their export market should start to open up a bit. Their steel is definitely becoming more competitive. But aside from that, the demand in South America, I think is still a bit constrained, given the end markets.","India, we're still seeing some good opportunities. We've had a few announcements here and we're working with some of the large steel makers there. So I think, in balance, that one has been a good story.","China is just a story of excess capacity. It's well known the government has made very explicit efforts to try and reduce that capacity. We welcome that. I think it's just been very slow going for that capacity to be reduced. So until that happens and those mills are closed that are kind of really fringe mills, second and third tier, I just don't think that situation will be fixed anytime soon.","And in Europe, what we're seeing is if you have the mills, you're running them. And we're seeing some customers run them fairly hard. But I wouldn't expect much incremental investments in Europe at this point. But that remains to be seen.","And as far as the argon, I think argon always is naturally tight. We're just not seeing the high levels sustainments that we had seen in the prior quarters for some of the production rates. It does go up and down, but in this particular quarter, we just didn't see the type of rates we've seen in the past few quarters.","Michael J. Harrison - Global Hunter Securities LLC","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from James Sheehan of SunTrust. Your line is now open.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking my question. Just curious, with the weak volumes, if you could update us on where you're seeing merchant utilization rates around the world?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure, James. Starting in North America, high 70%s, and that's a little bit down from last quarter and it's partly due to some of the things we'd mentioned with manufacturing argon and just further erosion in some of the upstream oil.","South America is still kind of those mid-80%s range. And as I mentioned last call, a lot of it is going into the non-cyclical industries. So fairly resilient merchant supplies there. Europe is low, mid-70%s. We are, as I mentioned, starting to see some uptick. So while the energy business is quite down, the base underlying and manufacturing is picking up. And we're especially seeing that more in the packaged side of the business. And Asia, it's a little bit different depending upon the country. On balance, we're probably mid-70%s. But Korea still quite high. India is low, but that's just due to some capacity it started up. We're loading that capacity as we speak. And then China is a little low just given partly the overcapacity and partly our concerted effort to transition from distributor sales to direct sales. So that's kind of around the world. Not a lot of change from last quarter. But we clearly have ample capacity to rebound when demand presents itself.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Very good. And also if you could just comment a little bit about the chemicals end market. We saw weaker chemicals growth this quarter than even energy. I was wondering if you could just flesh that out a little bit more. I take it that's all in North America. Is that a temporary lull, do you think? Or what's going on in chemicals?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. And, yeah, North America is really driving that number, to your point. And there's a couple pieces. One, consistent with what we had said in the last call, natural gas, while we exclude the pass-through, is impacting that number a bit as we have it embedded in some of the pricing of the co-products that we have, so CO, methanol, certain products, steam. So that is negatively impacting that as natural gas has dropped almost 40% year-over-year.","There also were some outages in North America and it's impacting, frankly, our packaged business even more so than either on-site or merchant. And that has also negatively impacted that. So I would say a good portion to this is temporary in terms of some of the outages in the natural gas. But overall, there might be a little bit of softening in chemicals. As you see oil drop, I think the end products of some of these chemical customers are going to be a little squeezed, their margins. And I think you're starting to see that in some of the chemical companies' recent reports and outlook. So I think there is a little bit of softening happening there.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Very good. And finally, on Mexico, could you just update us on the situation with Pemex? How do you see activities developing in Mexico?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, activity is pretty low still. Their oil output has continued to drop. They're still going through some belt tightening in terms of balancing their fiscal books. So from that perspective, not much improvement. Now, the rest of Mexico is actually performing quite well. Automotive is very strong. The peso hit MXN 16.30 the other day, which is making their exports extremely competitive, especially when added to their labor costs.","So certain markets continue to do quite well. But the Pemex and oil market really just has not improved here. And I think until there's some investments that are brought in, whether it's third party investments or partnerships that Pemex may have, it's hard to find when this is going to turn. But we have heard that there might be some budget loosening here, which would bode well for more wells to be drilled. But at this point, we're not really anticipating much of that.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning. Wonder if you could just touch quickly on helium, on how that's being impacted by the slowdown globally and how supply\/demand operating rates and pricing trends are handling there?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. Helium is definitely looser than it was a year ago. You had a combination of more sources coming on coupled with customers being much more conservative in how they're using helium, whether it's more helium reclamation projects, some small, very limited but small substitution where feasible.","So what you've seen is I think the helium market went from being very tight to in balance to now you've probably got a little bit more supply than demand. And you're especially seeing that in some of the electronic sectors in Asia. So that is on a volume basis part of the Asia challenge as well.","But I think from a sourcing perspective, we're still very comfortable with our \u2013 we have a very broad level of sourcing that's got a pretty good average cost that we can still be competitive in the market. So still a very good business for us. It just goes in these cycles of being very tight to not tight. And I'd say right now it's more than imbalanced and it's created a bit of a headwind year-over-year in volumes given that.","Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then I believe maybe Kelcey in her prepared remarks mentioned that you guys were starting up a plant in Russia or did this quarter. Can you just kind of walk us through how you're thinking about the strategy there given the geopolitical stuff? And how are the assets that you have there running and cash flowing versus expectations?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So first as far as the assets, we're running them quite hard actually. We've been loading the assets much quicker than expected. The two on-site ones were strict facility fee approaches, but they're both running quite well right now. So from the perspective of if you're in the country and you have the assets, we're actually running them quite well. I think to your point, the geopolitical situation is challenging in the sense of we just don't know looking forward where it'll go. The country, Russia, itself is facing stagflation right now. But all in all, I'd say we're still fairly happy with what we have on the ground there. I think the bigger question for us is incremental investments we just need to be cautious on.","But we're still looking, and we're still pursuing opportunities there. We're just even more selective, I'd say, than we have been. And frankly, the contracts and the way we establish them coming into Russia several years ago have really played out well for us. And not just protection from the ruble, but also just some of the terms and conditions around some of the uncertainties that you face in this country. So I would say while we were a bit disappointed on some of the execution costs and overruns we had in building, the actual demands have played out fairly well. And it's still a geography that we're intensely looking at for growth.","Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys.","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Welcome. I think we have time for one more.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question will come from the line of Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Matt, I think your current debt to EBITDA, or net debt-to-EBITDA level is about 2.5 times. Do you think it should be higher or lower, or are you at exactly the right spot?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Jeff, I think first just from the calculation itself, as you can imagine, a substantial portion of our debt is dollar-based. Now we just did two euro issuances. But for the most part that debt is dollar-based. And the EBITDA is more than half, as foreign currency impact. So right now that metric is being a little bit stressed because of foreign currencies and it is thus being inflated a bit because of foreign currencies. So I sort of look at more retained cash flow, some of my kind of coverage ability and a few different metrics in addition to that one.","But all in all, I would answer your question as such that I'm fairly comfortable with our net debt levels. We did increase debt a little bit in Q1. We decreased debt a little bit in Q2. But I am fairly comfortable that where we're at is not an issue either way. And if we see some opportunities, we may raise debt a little bit, whether it's for growth or buybacks, but nothing that material either direction.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then lastly, your restructuring charge was $146 million. I take it that that's probably all cash in that it seems that it's dedicated to severance. And (58:33) looks like...","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No. I'm sorry. Just to clarify, no, it's not all cash. It's about half. You'll see it in the Q. We do break out cash and noncash, about half is cash.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Well, the reason why I thought it was more cash is you said that this was a 5% employee reduction. Wouldn't that be about 1,400 people? And wouldn't $75 million or so as a cash charge be too small for that magnitude of 5% head count reduction?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No. I think with this charge, a little over two-thirds were in the emerging markets.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So China, Brazil, so when you do that math of the average salary, you do need to take into consideration, this is a U.S. dollar number on emerging market foreign currency salaries.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you so much.","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","You're welcome.","Kelcey E.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Kelcey Hoyt, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed, ma'am.","Kelcey E. Hoyt","Thanks, Jeff. Good morning and thank you for attending our first quarter earnings call and webcast. I'm joined this morning by Jim Sawyer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Liz Hirsch, our Vice President and Controller.","Today's presentation materials are available on our website at praxair.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference.","In addition, please note that sequential comparisons include an adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2011 and the reconciliation to the U.S. GAAP reported numbers are in the appendix to this presentation and the press release. Jim and I will now review Praxair's first quarter results and outlook. We'll then be available to answer questions.","James S. Sawyer","Thank you, Kelcey, and good morning, everyone. Praxair turned in another solid quarter, with EPS growth of 7% year-on-year despite currency headwinds and weakening economic conditions in several markets. Our North American segment, Canada, the United States and Mexico, turned in a stellar performance with operating profit growth of 16%, fueled by improving manufacturing conditions and strong operating leverage as volumes rebounded. In Europe, we experienced lower volumes and negative operating leverage particularly due to the financial crisis affecting Spain and Italy. In South America, operating profit was negatively impacted as currency devaluation, a recession in Brazil and production distribution dislocations in our operations all occurred at the same time. In Asia, a strong performance in industrial gases with much of our production capacity sold-out was partially offset by falling volumes and prices of product sold to the electronics and solar markets.","Fully diluted earnings per share were $1.38. Earnings included about $10 million of other income attributable to the net effect of gains on asset sales and the recognition of income from a legal settlement, partially offset by some restructuring and severance costs. Excluding the onetime items, the underlying run rate of EPS is closer to $1.36.","For the second quarter, we're expecting a continuation of the same business trends and are issuing earnings guidance of $1.40 to $1.45. For the full year, our earnings guidance is $5.75 to $5.90, increasing the bottom end of the range by $0.05. We do expect a stronger second half of 2012 as the Brazil economy gets back on track to a 4% annualized GDP growth rate and as the electronics sector picks up in the fall.","Our long-term growth plans remains strong and we're maintaining our capital spending forecast of $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion against a backlog of $2.7 billion of projects under construction with committed customer contracts. As these projects start up over the next 2 to 3 years, the contribution to sales and earnings growth should accelerate. At the same time, we are in negotiation on a record amount of new contracts, mostly in the emerging markets which should extend our growth horizons significantly. The production of cleaner energy is the largest growth driver in our portfolio. Within the next 18 months, we'll start up 3 world-scale steam methane reformers, which will increase our hydrogen production capacity by 35%. Additionally, our backlog of projects in China where we're currently sold out, should increase our sales there by more than 40%. And now, I'll let Kelcey explain in more detail our first quarter results.","Kelcey E. Hoyt","Thanks, Jim. Now please turn to Slide 3 for our consolidated first quarter results. Praxair's first quarter results reflect solid growth and continuing operating leverage, with sales growth of 5%, operating profit growth of 6% and EPS growth of 7%. Consolidated sales in the first quarter were $2.8 billion, up 5% versus the prior-year quarter. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted sales 2%, as foreign currencies weakened against the U.S. dollar from the prior-year quarter. The most significant impact to sales came from the Brazilian real, Mexican peso and euro. Underlying sales grew 8% excluding currency and the impact of cost pass-through from lower natural gas prices passed through to hydrogen customers. Higher volumes contributed 4% growth and price contributed 2%. Underlying sales grew in all geographic segments with the exception of Europe. Growth was strongest in North America, driven by strong sales to metals, energy and manufacturing markets. Sales growth continued in South America and Asia from new projects and higher volumes from applications for industrial gases. In Europe, sales were higher than the prior year due to the consolidation of our industrial gas business in Scandinavia. Excluding this acquisition and negative currency effects, sales in Europe were below prior year due to the weak economic environment, particularly in southern Europe.","Sequentially, sales grew 2% from underlying growth in all geographic segments except Asia, where volumes were lower. Primarily from seasonal impacts of the Lunar New Year and further weakness in specialty gases for electronics markets. Operating profit grew to $627 million in the quarter, 6% above the prior year and the operating margin was a strong 22.1%. Higher volumes, combined with price and productivity savings, were the primary contributors to the growth.","Net income of $419 million grew 5% from the prior year and less than operating profit due primarily to higher interest expense from increased long-term debt issued during 2011 to lock in lower interest rates. During the first quarter, we issued $600 million of 10-year notes at a rate of 2.45% to refinance other long-term debt maturities. Our debt-to-capital ratio for the quarter was 51.3%, and debt-to-EBITDA was 1.9x.","Earnings per share of $1.38, up 7% from the prior-year, grew faster than net income due to share repurchases. During the quarter, we completed the $1.5 billion program authorized during July of 2010. $1.4 billion remains available under the new $1.5 billion program authorized during January of this year, which we expect to complete in 2013.","After-tax return on capital for the quarter decreased slightly to 14.2% due to the large amount of project capital under construction and therefore, on our balance sheet, not yet completed. Return on equity increased to 29.4%.","Please turn to Page 4 for our results in North America. Sales in North America were $1.4 billion, 6% above the prior-year quarter. Underlying sales grew 10% from higher volumes and pricing. The negative effects of currency translation and cost pass-through, primarily, historically low natural gas prices, which are contractually passed on to customers, reduced sales by 4%. Underlying sales growth versus the prior-year quarter came from all 3 distribution methods, on-site, merchant and packaged, and in all countries, the United States, Canada and Mexico. Sequentially, sales grew from 1% higher volumes in on-site and packaged gas primarily in the steel and manufacturing markets. On-site sales volumes versus the prior-year quarter were quite strong and driven primarily by the energy and metals markets in all 3 countries, with the strongest growth in the United States.","Our Gulf Coast refinery volumes were significantly stronger year-over-year due to fewer of our hydrogen customers taking turnarounds in the first quarter of 2012 versus the prior year, as well as the refineries taking increased volumes of hydrogen. We also had strong spot sales out of our Gulf Coast hydrogen storage cavern to meet customer needs. The cavern stores over 2 billion cubic feet of high purity hydrogen and is uniquely integrated into our 310-mile Gulf Coast area hydrogen pipeline, which serves more than 50 refineries and chemical plants from Texas City, Texas, to Lake Charles, Louisiana. On-site volumes rose to metal customers in part due to strong oxygen sales on our pipelines in the northern United States. During the quarter, several customers increased utilization at existing assets in their steel mills. In addition, on-site sales grew from continued usage and new installations of our applications technology in the area of blast furnace, oxygen enrichment, Stove Oxygen Enrichment and oxy-fuel steel reheating at steel customers in the area. This includes Praxair's dilute oxygen system combustion technology that provides operators with a flexible, low-cost way to convert burners from air fuel to oxy-fuel systems and can increase productivity, decrease fuel consumption, lower operating cost and reduce emissions. Even though low natural gas price -- even with low natural gas prices, our customers continue to use oxy-fuel technology for fuel substitution, which provides increased throughput and cost savings and energy efficiency benefits.","Merchant sales volumes grew modestly versus the prior-year quarter. Sequentially, merchant volumes were steady. Canada experienced some slowing in liquid nitrogen sales late in the first quarter, as the warmer weather accelerated the timing of the spring thaw, which prohibits heavy trucks from getting to the frac-ing locations. Packaged gas sales remained strong, in line with manufacturing strength. In PDI, our U.S. and Canadian business same-store sales, which excludes currency and acquisitions, were 12% above last year. Gases were up 9% and hard goods were up 19%."," ","Hard goods' strength continues to spin [ph] around welding equipment, including robotics and automation solutions that help improve customer productivity. The packaged gas business is heavily weighted towards metal fabrication and sales are strong for automobile-related welding, including auto parts, the oil and gas industry, heavy equipment building and repair that requires welding. North American operating profit was $361 million, 16% above the prior-year quarter. The operating margin was 25.8%. The strong operating margin reflects the strength and efficiency of our production and distribution systems, which result in improved operating leverage.","Merchant pricing trends for all products remains positive. As these contracts are typically of a 3- to 5-year duration, our ability to increase the price is impacted by the timing of contract renewals. We expect to continue to realize low single-digit percentage impact from pricing actions in North America this year. The region has several projects in the backlog that are expected to start up within the next 12 months, including the 2 hydrogen projects under construction for Valero at St. Charles and Port Arthur, as well as others serving the manufacturing, energy and metals market. Proposal activity for new on-site plants remains strong, with activity in energy, chemicals, manufacturing and metals.","Last week, we announced a new long-term contract to supply oxygen, argon and nitrogen to Deacero, a leading Mexican steel company. We will build, own and operate a new state-of-the-art and energy-efficient cryogenic air separation unit in northern Mexico with a capacity of 500 tons per day, which is expected to start up in 2014. The plant will also expand Praxair's capacity in the region. Now, please turn to Page 5 for our results in Europe.","Sales in Europe increased 9% for the first quarter versus 2011. The sales increase was due to the acquisition of an increased ownership interest in Yara Praxair in October of last year, which now requires consolidation. This was partially offset by a 3% negative impact from currency as the euro devalued versus the U.S. dollar. Excluding these items, underlying sales decreased from lower overall volume, partially offset by higher pricing. Volumes in Spain and Italy were below prior year, primarily attributable to packaged gases where customer demand was weaker due to lower industrial economic activity. Higher volumes in Germany versus prior year partially offset this impact. Pricing was slightly higher across the region due to initiatives taken to offset cost increases. Price improvements in Spain, Italy and Germany were partially offset by a continued pricing weakness in electronics and medical oxygen. We remain focused on obtaining and improving price in the regions in which we operate. Packaged gas organic sales declined 6% year-over-year and grew 3% sequentially. The sequential growth is driven by Italy, Germany and Scandinavia, partially offset by further volume weakness in Spain.","Operating profit of $68 million was comparable to the prior year. Excluding the favorable impact of the Yara Praxair acquisition and the negative currency impact, underlying operating profit decreased 5% versus the prior-year quarter. Lower volumes decreased operating profit by 8%, partially offset by higher productivity and cost savings, resulting from our fourth quarter restructure. During the second half of 2012, we plan to start up 3 of our 4 plants currently under construction in Russia. In addition, last month, we announced the acquisition of an industrial gas business located in the South Volga region. Two of the 3 on-site plants scheduled to start up later this year are also located in this region and will allow us to accelerate the establishment of a fully-integrated industrial gas model to leverage on-site merchant and packaged gas, and build production distribution density in the area. The on-site plants will serve the chemical and glass industries.","Page 6 shows our results in South America. South American segment sales were $562 million, up 1% from the prior-year quarter. Underlying sales grew 5% from higher volumes and higher pricing. This growth was offset by negative currency translation impacts, primarily, the weakening of the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar, which reduced sales by 5%. Higher volumes increased sales by 2%, and were driven by new on-site production facilities serving metals and energy markets. Volumes to merchant and packaged gas customers were below prior year, largely attributable to the lower industrial production rates in Brazil. Higher pricing increased sales by 3% and helped partially offset cost increases.","By end market, year-over-year sales increased to metals, health care and food and beverage customers and were relatively flat to manufacturing customers. Sequentially, on-site and packaged gas sales grew but were partially offset by modest declines in merchant. Operating profit in South America was $115 million, a decrease of 14% versus the quarter a year ago. Currency reduced operating profit by 6%. Excluding the currency effects, operating profit was 8% below the prior-year quarter. Higher pricing increased operating profit, but only partially offset higher costs related to power, distribution and product dislocation. In addition, a lower mix of higher-margin merchant liquid volumes contributed to the lower profit. South America has a number of projects scheduled to start up and again, generating revenue under long-term contracts over the next 12 months in Brazil, Peru and Uruguay, serving the chemicals, metals and manufacturing markets. The proposal activity for new large growth projects remains strong in the energy, chemicals, steel and manufacturing markets across South America.","Please turn to Slide 7 for our results in Asia. Sales of $334 million grew 5% versus the prior-year quarter due primarily to volume growth. Volume growth of 5% came primarily from new plant startups in China and India from metals and chemicals customers, which resulted in higher on-site and merchant volume. Overall volume growth was negatively impacted by 5% lower sales to electronics customers in Asia, due to lower demand from semiconductor, flat-panel display and solar customers. Lower pricing, primarily to the electronics end market, reduced sales by 1% from the prior-year quarter. We expect this challenging price environment to continue as long as electronics volumes remain weak. Asia's operating profit grew 8% from the prior-year quarter, primarily as a result of higher volumes. In most markets, growth is constrained, as our plants are operating at full capacity. Looking forward, we have 11 projects expected to start up over the next 12 months, including our second gasification project in China. This one for the Wuwei coking project, our fifth expansion for Meishan Steel and high purity nitrogen for a large electronics customer in Korea. New project activity for the region remains robust, and we expect several new project announcements in the next few months, as customer contracts are signed.","Our results for Surface Technologies are shown on Page 8. PST sales this quarter were $169 million, up 8% year-over-year. During the quarter, we continued to see stronger growth in coatings to the oil and gas market, globally driven by deepwater and shale gas drilling, as well as strong demand for jet engine coatings particularly in North America. Operating profit in the first quarter was $26 million, driven primarily by higher volume and price, partially offset by increases in cost. With that, I'd like to turn this call over to Q&A. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mike Harrison with First Analysis.","Steven Schwartz - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","It's actually Steve Schwartz sitting in for Mike today.","On South America, can you give us some more color on the product dislocations in the higher power cost?","James S. Sawyer","Yes. Yes, this was one of the quarters where South America didn't do as well as we had expected. And basically, I kind of describe it as one of those perfect storm situations with 3 negative factors happening all at the same time. The first one being that the currency is off about 5% year-on-year and about $1.80 real exchange rate. I don't see that getting better during the rest of the year and I'll talk about that in a second. The second one being basically a manufacturing slowdown in Brazil, with industrial production off about 3% and vehicle builds off about 10% year-on-year. I do expect that the economy will significantly rebound in the second half, as the government is doing pretty much everything it can to improve the economy.","They are trying to keep the real from getting too strong and that's why I don't think it will be much better for us in the rest of the year. They're also lowering interest rates, putting tariffs on imported goods and so forth. So we do expect the economy to pick up in the second half. Now the comment on the production side, we had some plant outages during the quarter, which really didn't affect our sales all that much but required us to pull a lot of liquid, which we lost money on and we also had less power efficiency in our power costs, all happening at the same time. And those should straighten out in the second quarter.","Steven Schwartz - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Okay. Can you give us an idea of the magnitude of those costs? How much?","James S. Sawyer","Roughly $6 million in the quarter.","Steven Schwartz - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","$6 million. Okay, Jim. And you're saying that this is all isolated to the first quarter?","James S. Sawyer","Pretty much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Edward Yang with Oppenheimer.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Jim, the comment on the negative pricing in Asia to the electronics and solar markets, assume that wasn't in atmospheric gases, that was all in specialty gases and materials?","James S. Sawyer","Right. It's sort of a combination of a number of products, but it's specialty gases and some of them is the materials that we sell into the semiconductor market. On top of that, we had argon pricing in China significantly lower year-on-year as a result of the solar production being reduced to about 50% of capacity utilization and solar production is a pretty big consumer of argon. And so Argon prices were also lower this year than last year.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And India, the merchant up 17%, that was very strong and you mentioned application tech. Could you provide some color around that?","James S. Sawyer","Yes, India is doing very well. We're getting good, solid growth, not only from on-site projects as we build and start up new on-site projects but also, from merchant sales which are partly just coming from overall growth in the economy and growth in demand. But I also think we're doing a great job with technology transfer and applications development in the metal fab and welding markets, in the food and beverage markets, also growth in the pharmaceutical markets. So I think that we're doing a good job in India and we've got a good growth outlook there. Again, similar to China, our merchant capacity is pretty much being fully utilized right now. And so, we're waiting for some of these projects to start up to grow the merchant volumes more.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Jim, electronics was down 5%, the volumes were down I think 5%. Can you slice that further? Is solar dragging the business down and what are you seeing in electronics, the semiconductors business, and what are your expectations there in the second half?","James S. Sawyer","Right. Well, there are basically 3 end markets. And one way of looking at it, the semiconductor market, which is the largest market, followed by the LED and liquid crystal displays and then the solar market, which is really actually the smaller of the markets right now. The solar market is not doing well and is dragging down sales and particularly, silane and argon, okay? So that's hurting and I think that -- I don't know when that will get better but I think there's a big overinvestment in solar production capacity right now. Semiconductor and LED probably will pick up in the second half. It tends to be a bit of a seasonal business where some of the semiconductor and displays are -- grow faster in the second half and part of that's related to the holiday season and Christmas and so forth in North America.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And secondly, in the U.S. merchant business, you showed some modest growth while your competitor struggled. So I'm wondering if you believe you gained share in U.S. merchant.","James S. Sawyer","I can't really comment on that, the competitive side of it. But basically, what we're seeing in North America and I speak really for Mexico, Canada and the U.S. is packaged sales, I'll come back to that. But package and merchant volumes are recovering nicely in line with a rebound in manufacturing activity, metal fabrication, in the equipment and so forth. On top of that, you do see some fluctuation in the merchant volume that is related to the frac-ing side of the business. And the frac-ing side of the business, it was actually fairly strong in the last couple of quarters, probably be a little bit weaker in the second quarter because of the -- what they call the breakup of the frozen ice in Canada. But we're continuing to see strong growth in manufacturing and I think that we're in for a couple a year, a very strong volume [ph] in North America in overall manufacturing, pretty much fueled by the low natural gas prices, which makes the United States a very low cost production location for steel and a lot of other items.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Abhiram Rajendran - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is Abhi Rajendran calling in for John."," With pricing continuing to lag in Europe, it feels like the one strong discipline in the industry may be cracking a bit. Do you have concerns about this? And if not, I guess why is Europe a different animal relative to the rest of the world?","James S. Sawyer","Well, it is a fair -- there's a number of differences. But basically, Europe is in a pretty tough recession right now and some of our products get sold into what I would call the capital investment cycle, which means that where customers are building things, they\u2019re not only building more cars but they're building plants to build more cars, for example. And so, with this financial crisis going on in Europe right now, particularly metal fabrication and machinery and construction and maintenance spending are significantly curtailed, both in -- particularly in Spain and Italy but also, in France and other parts of Europe as well. And so, the lack of clarity on the financial side has really kind of paralyzed the capital spending in Europe. So that's really the biggest issue in Europe. I think a second issue is it's harder to control inflation in Europe and I'm not saying that inflation is out of control, but you have mandated wage increases and so forth for your employees. And also, power cost increases going on. So we're not getting enough price increases in Europe to offset our cost increases. And so, to get back at that, we just need to redouble our efforts on productivity.","Abhiram Rajendran - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Got it. And just a quick follow up on Asia. So the backdrop, especially with post Chinese New Year's pick up being a little bit slow period, a little bit difficult in the quarter, could you talk a little bit about your kind of, more positive outlook for the back half of the year in this geography and which country and sectors you're particularly positive on rebounding?","James S. Sawyer","Okay. Well, China always has the Lunar -- I mean, in other parts of Asia, always have the Lunar and Chinese New Year holiday and everybody stops working for a week or 2, and plants take turnarounds and shutdowns and so forth. So that's not a new phenomenon. It just makes our first quarter results in Asia typically soft relative to the rest of the year. As historically in Europe, the third quarter with summer vacation would make the third quarter soft relative to the rest of the year. So I don't see anything that is a trend of a slowdown in Asia other than in the electronics sector, which I just spoke about. We're continuing to see strong year-on-year growth in demand in Korea and India, in China, in Thailand, in Taiwan, which are the countries that we operate in. And as I said before, we're bringing on some significant new projects this year which will not only improve our sales growth and volume growth to the on-site customers, which are the baseload for those projects, but will also give us a little bit more liquid oxygen, liquid nitrogen and argon to sell in the merchant markets, where we\u2019re basically capacity constrained right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Jim, I want to go back to the strength that you're seeing in North America on a relative basis. Do you think it's -- that you have a better geographic footprint in North America in terms of your exposure to steel and autos and sort of that strength in the Midwest corridor? Or do you think it's better applications technology? What kind of drives your strong relative performance in North America?","James S. Sawyer","I don't know without being about a comparative basis, I can't really speak. But I can tell you that we've -- our -- we're seeing a nice resurgence in end markets on steel. We're basically near full capacity. Our steel customers in both the Chicago region and the Great Lakes region are now extremely competitive on a global basis and some of the international companies that own operations both in Brazil and the United States, for example, are producing more in the United States and less in Brazil or Europe and the United States, the same thing. For steel, natural gas is probably the fourth or fifth highest cost item in producing steel after iron ore and pet coke, I mean, coking coal and so forth. So that's -- the lower natural gas price is helping steel. We're also seeing people like General Motors and Caterpillar and others decide to build more factories, buy more rail cars, that kind of thing. And so, it's just giving us some -- a lot of good sales growth. And at the same time, we've got some pricing leverage in North America and very little inflation in our cost structure.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And I know argon and helium have been tight, but I assume if you're running flat out on steel, that you got very good availability on argon, but can you comment on the helium outlook?","James S. Sawyer","Yes, argon is pretty well in balance. Helium is a different beast. Helium is not made as a byproduct from air separation. Helium is basically created in the earth from the decay of radioactive materials and like oil and gas, it gets trapped under cap rocks as it rises. And they're really only about 6 places in the world where you can get helium. And the United States being a strong one, but also, in the Middle East and Russia. We have really invested a lot of capital in backward integrating in our sources of helium over the last, in my lifetime with the company, 25 years. So we have a very strong sourcing in helium. I think we're the only sourcer of helium and the only company in the helium business that has not put customers on allocation. And so, we are actually increasing price in helium because the demand -- supply-demand imbalance there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","In terms of PDI continues to post pretty impressive results there, still in the double digits, do you see that sustainable for the next several quarters in terms of demand?","James S. Sawyer","I think so. I think that what you have to -- part of what you have to do is look back and we are now in this quarter, finally back above what I would call pre-recession levels in terms of base business in packaged gas. So we still got room to grow there. I think the customer base, the metals fab, and equipment and so forth [ph] that I spoke about earlier is going to continue to grow in North America. So I do see a good, solid outlook for packaged gases in North America.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then when I think about North America volumes in total, 7%, pretty impressive there, can you break that out between maybe new projects? Did you have a lot of new projects coming in? And just trying to get a feel for what base demand looks like here in North America.","James S. Sawyer","Right. Probably about 3\/4 of that is not related to new projects, and about 1\/4 is related to new projects. We haven't started up a lot of projects in the last 12 months. And if I kind of reflect on that a little bit, we have about $2.7 billion as we discussed, of backlog of new projects. To just kind of spread out when are those starting up over time, roughly $400 million starts up in the first half of 2012, $600 million in the second half of 2012 and closer to $800 million in the first half of 2013. So we will start to see some much more significant contribution from startups moving into 2013.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I just want to slice the electronics business from a different angle. How much of that is nitrogen or on projects that are on take-or-pay contracts?","James S. Sawyer","Right. Our total electronics business I would say, probably 60% or 70% is on-site gases. And they are -- if we just look at that in isolation, it's not down year-on-year, okay? And the biggest concentration -- location for that and concentration is with Samsung in Korea. And generally, what they do when there's a downturn is where they've outsourced production to third-party fabs and there's a downturn, they bring that production back into Korea again. So what I would say that relative good performance for our electronics business is largely a function of the fact that most of it is on-site nitrogen.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","But those contracts are now above the take-or-pay, so if there's a cyclical recovery, you still get the upside left?","James S. Sawyer","There's nobody who's on a take-or-pay situation where they're paying but not taking products.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then you mentioned in a few regions and end markets, you're being capacity-constrained. If you just look at the portfolio globally, how much capacity would you need just to get to a point where you didn't feel that you were capacity-constrained and putting customers potentially at risk or in tight situations?","James S. Sawyer","Well, perhaps I should correct myself a little bit. I would say -- I don't want to leave the impression that if we had more capacity in the quarter that just ended, that we would've sold more. That's not the impression -- that's not the situation. But we've got good growth and we're close to full capacity. And so we can always kind of make more capacity by moving products around from one location into another location. Because sometimes, you're -- in one particular area, you may be totally sold out but then if you got a production distribution system, you can haul product in from other locations where you're not sold out. But that tends to increase the distribution cost. But generally speaking, if I commented around the world, we're running in the kind of low- to mid-80s in merchant capacity utilization and probably mid-80s in North America and a little bit higher than that in China and India but down in the low-70s in Europe.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Your other income was unusually large this quarter at $14 million versus a cost of $1 million in the year ago period. What caused that $15 million swing?","James S. Sawyer","Okay. We always have nonrecurring, I guess you could call things happening. But basically, we had some other income coming from a power contract that we won in a litigation award on in South America. We also had a piece of land sale in Korea, and a gain on some of our electronic component business that we sold. And we also at the same time, increased our severance cost and incurred some restructuring costs. So we're not going to be running $14 million of other income every quarter. So as I mentioned, roughly about $10 million of that was kind of from those items and we'll typically see other income of closer to $5 million in a quarter, most quarters.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then for my follow-up. Some industrial gas companies not only have large capital expenditures but they also have large capital leases, whereas for a large capital lease payments, when I look at Praxair, I don't seem to see that structure. Do you have that structure, and is that a choice of the industrial gas company or does it have something to do with the industrial gas customer? Can you clarify a little bit of that?","James S. Sawyer","That's a result of a quirky accounting rule that really doesn't make much logical sense. But basically, there's an accounting rule which says that if 100% of a project output is going to a single customer in a single location, that's really a capital lease from the customer's point of view. And so, we would need to book that as a capital lease receivable rather than as capital expenditures. We don't have much of that because we have a more integrated business. And if we were -- if you're just doing standalone projects with a single customer in a single location, it's likely that some of those, the customer will have to account for as a capital lease and therefore, you'll have to account for it that way. But the vast majority of our projects, as you know are places where we have a pipeline system where we can supply to other customers from the same plant or where we've got liquid take-out and so forth. So we just don't have very much of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Goley [ph], with Goley [ph] and Associates.","Unknown Analyst","First question is on hydrogen, if I can. In your early remarks, I think Jim, you talked about 3 hydrogen plants and then Kelcey talked about 2 for Valero. Can you talk about who the third one is? Could it possibly be Chevron El Segundo or is it somebody else?","James S. Sawyer","There's another one that's coming on stream in the next 12 months in India, from an Indian oil company. The other project that you mentioned in the Chevron, in Richmond is still in a delayed situation and will not be coming on stream at least in 2012 or 2013.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And secondly, for my follow-up, one of the negatives associated with lower natural gas costs for one of your competitors was the fact that bonus payments and inefficiency segments are worth less if the natural gas price is lower. Do you have the same kind of a bonus arrangement and are you getting hit just a little bit on the backside by lower natural gas costs regarding that particular item?","James S. Sawyer","Yes, it's really in our -- I don't think it's really a bonus payment issue. The issue is when you sign a contract to sell either oxygen and you have an escalation formula where you pass through the price of electricity, the percentage of revenue which escalates to your electricity should be about equal to what you spend on electricity, okay? And the same thing with natural gas pass-through in hydrogen sales. But you can do contracts which are over escalated or under escalated, and then you're really not neutral to the price of natural gas anymore. And part of that has to do with the additional products that we sell in the hydrogen business, where pretty much, the underlying escalation will be related specifically to the hydrogen sales. But we're also selling steam in the form of -- well, energy in the form of steam to the customer and those sales are based on the value and the price of natural gas. And to the extent to which you got steam sales going on, that can be real operating profit, which goes up or down with natural gas.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","James Sheehan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Jim Sheehan sitting in for Dave."," Some of your peers in Europe commented on electronics markets starting to stabilize or maybe troughing and starting to get better sequentially. Are you seeing any evidence of that?","James S. Sawyer","I think they probably will. I haven't seen our results for April yet. But that's probably a good commentary.","James Sheehan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And just on the project backlog and your expectation of it about $0.60 in earnings per share uplift in 2013, could you just discuss with the bid activity level as it is, what is the upside to that EPS level that you've discussed?","James S. Sawyer","There's probably no upside to that number in 2013 because basically, I would say, a project that we would sign today, we wouldn't be starting up until 2014. So our -- the cake that we baked for 2013 is pretty much already baked.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It's Brian Maguire on for Bob today.","Just kind of a follow-up to that last one, just talking about the European volumes, packaged gas down 6% and the overall volume's down a couple of percent. Any kind of change in regional trends within Europe where you're seeing any improvement below the surface that might be a leading indicator for things getting better?","James S. Sawyer","Well, I don't know if I would call it a leading indicator but it's clearly the places that don't have government finance issues are doing pretty well and that would be primarily our business in Scandinavia, which is really pretty much un-impacted by that followed by Germany, which has got as a lesser impact and then Spain, Portugal and Italy where basically, people just aren't making spending decisions right now. And hopefully, that'll correct itself pretty soon.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just a follow up in the areas targeted by the increased severance spending. Any particular geography or end market targeted?","James S. Sawyer","Well, primarily, the places where we're not doing as well, where we had soft quarters and that would be South America and Europe.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Jim, I guess 2 questions on Europe. I think you gave us some moderate restructuring activity there and how is that going and what is the associated cost savings that you would expect in the back half of the year? And then the second question I have was on the Russia, with regard to your 3 plant startups. How much could that contribute in 2013? And perhaps, you could comment more broadly on how you see the Russian market shaping up over the next 3 years or so.","James S. Sawyer","Right. Severance costs or benefits from severance, we'll start to see benefit in the second half in Europe. It's not going to be a huge number especially where we've got inflationary cost greater than we can get price increases. But kind of the $5 million year run rate being kind of a number. Russia, we actually are absorbing that benefit since we're spending $5 million to $10 million a year in business development cost right now without any revenue today to show for it. But we will be starting up our first on-site plant next quarter or in the third quarter. And what we're basically doing is building an integrated on-site and merchant gas business in the Volgograd region which is sort of the center for chemical production, as well as some steel production. And then also up in near the Ural Mountains, with the large projects that we're doing with EVRAZ up there. So we should start to I guess, as we start up the first plant, that will probably cover our business development costs and then, as we start up the larger plants in the Urals, they'll start contributing pretty significant amounts of operating profit in the second half of 2013.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays Capital.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just to go back to the U.S. which I thought had a wonderful quarter, the 7% volume and 3% price that you got, does that feel like about the right run rate if kind of U.S. underlying business stays at the same ","level it was at in Q1?","James S. Sawyer","Yes. That's pretty good. I mean, if you look at it, industrial production is growing faster than they did and if you look inside of industrial production at markets like machinery and so forth, are still showing 8% kind of increases. So our numbers pretty much line up with that [indiscernible].","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then if you're getting price and we're already kind of touching 26% margins or close to that in the first quarter, can this segment get up 27% or so if this recovery lasts for another, call it 4 to 6 quarters?","James S. Sawyer","I don't know. It's a pretty good margin. The guys are doing a terrific job. We and a lot of other companies really have restructured our people cost in the United States and in Mexico and Canada. So we're operating a very high level of sales and productivity. And that's helped a lot, not only for us but some of our customers. I don't see a lot of upside in the operating margin percentage in North America. But I'm very happy with what the guys are doing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Manthey with Robert W. Baird.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","My question is on the negative impact of natural gas in currencies in the second quarter and beyond. As I'm looking at the revenues, the combined negative impact this quarter was about 3%. Is it possible that could be as much as twice the impact next quarter? And similarly, on the gross margin line, just given the natural gas pass-through, rough calculations, I'm coming up with maybe 50 basis points of gross margin improvement because of the collapse in natural gas prices and there too, couldn't that be as much as twice as big an impact as we look to the second quarter and third quarter?","James S. Sawyer","I don't see the natural gas impact being much different in the rest of the year than it is in the first quarter. In other words, we\u2019ve had  roughly $2 natural gas through the quarter and that's probably what we'll continue on. That's a -- been about a 50 basis points impact on the margin, I don't see that changing going forward. Now the other half of your question I think was about currencies and one -- we're expecting currencies to stay about where they are right now. Of course, they could end up being different than that but I'm not smart enough to forecast that. But the year-over-year comparables to last year's second and third quarters are going to see more like a 5%, 4% to 5% year-over-year comparison. And that's because the dollar was much weaker in the second and third quarters of last year than it is right now.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Right. Okay, And then just quickly, you've always been really good at growing your SG&A plus D&A at a slower rate than sales or I guess more appropriately, your gross profit dollar growth. Is there any reason that this year should be any different? As I'm looking at your guidance range in the EPS, it's sort of shaking out of that SG&A growth would be in the excess of sales growth or GP growth and I'm just wondering if there's anything unusual going on to have caused that.","James S. Sawyer","No. Generally, we would expect to see SG&A growth much lower than sales and gross margin growth. The one factor I would add to that which is the increase in our pension costs which is kind of a step change from the fourth quarter to the first quarter where we have on an annualized basis, about $30 million increase in pension and benefit costs this year.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Maybe just as a last question. Jim, you talked about the low natural gas prices in the U.S. being a stimulant for all sorts of activity. Are any of your customers coming to you and asking you to hedge that gas for them? Obviously, you have no reason to do it for yourself, this is the pass-through but are your customers looking for hedges?","James S. Sawyer","No. Our -- basically our customers are primarily the refining industry, okay? And the refining industry is quite well able to hedge its own exposure to energy prices, if you will. So basically, our -- what we want to do is, I\u2019ll describe it this way. The energy sector is a big end market for us and a big sector for growth. But we don't want our margins to be impacted plus or minus by changes in energy prices. We don't want to be in the energy business in that way. So we really just try to lock-in our operating profit dollars. But what I would say is that the low natural gas price relative to the price of oil significantly reduces the cost for refineries to use hydrogen in their refinery as a proportion of their total refining cost. And that's tending to drive up the consumption of hydrogen, which is a good thing for us.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude the Q&A portion of our call.

My name is Brianna, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Kelcey Hoyt, Director, Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Kelcey E. Hoyt","Thanks, Brianna. Good morning, and thank you for attending our fourth quarter earnings call and webcast. I am joined this morning by Matt White, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Liz Hirsch, our Vice President and Controller.","Today's presentation materials are available on our website at praxair.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference.","Please also note that our discussion of earnings for the full year and fourth quarter, including year-over-year and sequential comparisons, excludes a fourth quarter of 2013 bond redemption charge and an income tax benefit, as well as previously disclosed adjustments in 2013 and 2012. These items are detailed and reconciled to the reported GAAP numbers in the appendices to this presentation and the press release.","Matt and I will now review Praxair's full year and fourth quarter results as well as our outlook for 2014, including earnings guidance. We'll then be available to answer questions.","Matthew J. White","Thank you, Kelcey, and good morning, everyone. Praxair performed quite well in 2013. Key acquisitions in our core geographies and strong growth from capital projects in Asia and North America helped grow our sales well in excess of underlying economic trends.","Looking around the world, Brazil and Southern Europe both limped into 2013 with recessionary conditions but later stabilized and showed positive growth by the second half.","The North American story was mixed, given strong on-site sales and opportunities around cheap shale oil and gas, partly overshadowed with government uncertainties and limited investment in nonresidential construction, which weighed on packaged gas sales. And Asia continued to grow well across most geographies and end markets.","Excluding foreign currency, we grew full year sales 8% with strong price actions and contribution from project start-ups. EPS grew in line with sales.","We finished strong in the fourth quarter with robust operating leverage and a return to double-digit EPS growth. We successfully integrated multiple acquisitions and generated record operating cash flow of $2.9 billion, which speaks to the discipline and execution of the Praxair team around the world.","Looking forward, we have some significant foreign currency headwinds, specifically in the Brazilian real, the Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar. Excluding currency impact, we anticipate to grow earnings at a double-digit rate in 2014 from solid pricing and productivity, project contribution and moderate economic growth.","Please turn to Slide 3 for a further review of the 2013 full year results.","Overall sales were $11.9 billion, up 8% versus the prior year excluding negative currency translation effects. Sales growth came primarily from increased volumes in North America, South America and Asia and higher overall pricing.","Volume growth came from project start-ups and stronger underlying customer demand in most major geographies. Energy, chemicals, metals and manufacturing markets showed the strongest growth from the prior year.","Operating profit of $2.7 billion grew 8% year-over-year excluding foreign currency, from higher pricing, volume growth, productivity savings and acquisitions. We delivered strong EBITDA and operating margins of 31.9% and 22.3%, respectively.","During 2013, our productivity initiatives exceeded our targeted savings for a fifth year in a row. These efforts are not an annual event, but something that all employees are working toward on a daily basis. The constant focus on generating productivity initiatives, executing them and replicating them globally, typically within the areas of production, procurement and distribution, protects us against declining margins. One additional benefit is that approximately 25% of our savings came from what we call sustainable productivity initiatives, with the largest being energy efficiency improvements in our plants and distribution fleet.","Net income of $1.8 billion increased 5% from the prior year, slightly less than operating profit due to higher interest expense largely attributed to higher debt levels.","During 2013, we issued $2.6 billion of debt with a range of maturities and an average interest rate of 1.7%. Proceeds were used to fund acquisitions and refinance $1.3 billion. We were able to take advantage of low interest rates and our tight issue spreads to treasuries.","At year end, about 80% of our debt was fixed rate and about 20% was floating rate, as we have significantly reduced our exposure to rising interest rates.","Our after-tax return on capital for the year was 12.8%. This was suppressed by significant construction and progress on the balance sheet for plants that did not begin to contribute to earnings until the second half of the year, as well as the large amount of acquisitions in 2013, primarily NuCO2.","Capital projects spend, as well as the acquisition of NuCO2, are typically dilutive to ROC and below the corporate average for the first few years. We expect Praxair's return on capital to trend upward toward the end of 2014 as earnings contribution grows and the capital base depreciates. We maintained a healthy return on equity of 28.6%.","Please turn to Slide 4. We generated record operating cash flow of $2.9 billion for the year, which was equal to about 25% of sales. $3.3 billion was invested in disciplined growth through CapEx projects and acquisitions. $1.1 billion was returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","Capital spending in 2013 was $2 billion. About 75% of our annual capital spending goes into new growth projects under long-term contracts with customers, about 20% to maintenance spend and the remaining 5% for cost reduction projects, with a typical payback period of about 3 years.","In 2013, we invested $1.3 billion in acquisitions, primarily NuCO2 microbulk carbon dioxide in the United States, Dominion Technology Gases in Europe, serving the offshore oil and gas market, and several U.S. packaged gas distributors.","We continue to look selectively for tuck-in acquisitions in our core business, which are high-quality, low-risk properties where we can bring synergies to the business we are buying and where we can achieve an attractive return on investment.","We paid dividends of $708 million and, this morning, announced an 8% increase to our quarterly dividend in the first quarter of 2014, which represents our 21st consecutive annual increase. This is consistent with our policy of growing dividends each year in line with earnings growth.","During 2013, we purchased 436 million of stock, net of issuances, and reduced our outstanding share count by 1%. $407 million remains available under the share repurchase program that was authorized in 2012. We also announced that our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program of $1.5 billion, which, depending upon market conditions, we anticipate completing in 2015.","We expect to continue our strong cash flow generation and our stock buyback program to reduce the share count by about 1% to 2% annually without diminishing our credit rating or access to low-cost funding.","And now Kelcey will take you through the fourth quarter results.","Kelcey E. Hoyt","Thanks, Matt. Please turn to Slide 5. Fourth quarter sales were $3 billion and grew 10% over 2012, excluding negative currency translation effects. Organic sales increased 7% from higher volumes and higher overall pricing, with growth across all geographic segments. Sales were higher primarily to energy, metals, chemicals and manufacturing end markets.","Growth in the energy end market included record North American on-site hydrogen sales from project start-ups. Acquisitions in North America and Europe contributed 3% sales growth in the quarter. Sequentially, sales were comparable to the third quarter as higher pricing offset seasonally lower volumes.","Operating profit was $690 million, up 12%; and, excluding foreign currency, up 14% as compared to the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by volume growth, higher pricing and acquisitions. The EBITDA and operating margins grew to a record 32.8% and 22.9%, respectively.","Net income of $462 million and earnings per share of $1.55 were each up 12% year-over-year.","Fourth quarter operating cash flow was a record $964 million and funded $560 million -- $516 million of capital expenditures, $177 million of dividends and $86 million of share repurchases, net of issuances.","Our project backlog, which we define as projects with CapEx greater than $5 million and associated with a fully executed customer supply contract, remained strong at $2.2 billion and is comprised of 32 projects.","While we continue to anticipate the backlog to hover around $2 billion in CapEx, it may increase or decrease $100 million or so in a quarter depending on the timing of final contract execution as well as actual plant start-ups.","During the fourth quarter, we signed 3 long-term contracts for new projects located in South America and Asia and started 6 plants located across North America, South America and Asia. Our backlog is geographically diverse, with projects in North America and Asia each representing about 1\/3 of the capital expenditures in the backlog.","The rest of the backlog resides in Europe, primarily Russia, and in South America. These projects will serve a diverse set of customers in the energy, chemical, manufacturing, electronics and metals end markets.","Please turn to Page 6 for our results in North America.","Sales in North America were $1.6 billion, 11% above the prior year quarter. Underlying sales growth of 6% was primarily driven by higher on-site volumes from new project start-ups for hydrogen supply to refinery customers under long-term contracts in the United States and higher pricing. Acquisitions contributed 5% growth, primarily from NuCO2 as well as U.S. packaged gas distributors.","On-site sales continue to be strong across energy, chemical and metals markets. In the U.S., our customers in these process industries are continuing to take advantage of the low natural gas prices and high labor productivity, which makes them very competitive globally.","Merchant volume trends were steady year-over-year. Sequentially, there was seasonal weakness in carbon dioxide for beverage carbonation as well as liquid nitrogen sales in Mexico for our oil well services business.","Our liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen capacity utilization rates in the United States currently average about 80%, in line with where we have been most of the year.","We have capacity to grow volumes in most regions with little incremental cost and, therefore, strong operating leverage.","Packaged gas trends in North America improved modestly during the fourth quarter, primarily in Mexico and the United States.","Organic sales for our U.S. packaged gas business grew 4% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. The fourth quarter year-over-year growth continued to be driven by gases and rent, which were up high single digits, while hard goods declined at a low single-digit percentage.","By end market, the year-over-year growth came from oil and gas services, chemicals and refining, as well as spec gases to research and development activity.","Metal fabrication remained weaker, with modest improvement in the Central region. Heavy machinery is still weak, but appears to be stabilizing.","North American operating profit was $393 million, 7% above the prior year quarter due to higher volumes, including project start-ups, higher pricing and acquisitions. The operating margin was a strong 25.1%.","Pricing trends remain positive, and merchant contracts are typically of a 3- to 5-year duration, and the timing of price increases can be impacted by the timing of contract renewals.","During mid-December, we announced a North American merchant and packaged gas price action effective January 1, 2014, across several products and fees. We recently started up an expansion to air separation liquefaction capabilities in Fort Saskatchewan and Prentiss, Alberta. The plant upgrade and new equipment are part of Praxair's ongoing commitment to Western Canada's growing oil and gas market.","During 2014, in North America, we are on track to start up several additional plants, including supply and manufacturing in the United States and Mexico as well as metals in Canada.","Proposal activity for new industrial gas on-site plants in North America remained strong, particularly to the cost-advantaged chemical industry using natural gas as a feedstock. The list of potential chemical projects in the United States is increasing. And therefore, related opportunities for sale of gas is strong across all 3 distribution modes of on-site, merchant and packaged gas.","The pipeline of activity for U.S. packaged gas distributor acquisitions remained healthy.","Now please turn to Page 7 for our results in Europe. Sales in Europe were 11% above the prior year quarter. Excluding the positive effect of currency translation, sales grew 7%.","Acquisitions contributed 5%, primarily Dominion Technology Gases, an industrial gas company that serves the offshore oil and gas industry.","Organic sales were 2% above the prior year quarter due to price attainment and volume growth, driven by new project contribution in Russia as well as modest base business growth.","Southern Europe appears to be stabilizing, and this is the first quarter of positive base business growth year-over-year in our European segment in over 2 years.","Operating profit of $75 million was 25% above the prior year, which demonstrated strong operating leverage from modestly improving volumes, driven by prior cost management actions and price.","Assuming stable volumes across Europe in 2014, we expect to continue to see high-teens operating margins that reflect strong operating leverage on modest growth, as well as additional project contribution in Russia.","The backlog in Europe includes projects primarily in Northern Europe and Russia that will start up in 2014, 2015 and 2016.","We are participating in proposal activity in Northern Europe and Russia in the chemical, manufacturing and steel end markets.","Page 8 shows our results in South America. South American segment sales were $481 million, 1% below the prior year quarter. Underlying sales, excluding negative currency translation, grew 9% year-over-year due to underlying growth in most end markets. Sequentially, lower volumes in on-site, merchant and packaged gases reduced sales by 3%.","During the fourth quarter, customers in Brazil extended holiday shutdown periods. This occurred in most end markets, with the largest impacts in manufacturing and metals customers, which represents about half of Brazil sales.","About 25% of Praxair's sales in South America come from 8 countries outside of Brazil. Underlying sales in these countries grew 17% versus the prior year quarter and 5% sequentially, with strong price attainment and growth in chemicals and food and beverage, health care and metals end markets.","Operating profit in South America was $115 million versus $92 million in the prior year quarter, due primarily to improved volumes, higher pricing and a litigation settlement.","We had project start-up during the fourth quarter in Brazil, Uruguay and Peru.","In Peru, we started up a new 270-ton-per-day air separation plant. Under a long-term contract, Praxair will increase its supply of oxygen, nitrogen and argon to Peru's longest -- largest long-steel maker to meet expanding production capacity for products used in Peru's construction and mining sectors. This is Praxair's third plant serving this customer's facility.","During the fourth quarter, our backlog increased with new long-term supply contracts for customers in Brazil and Peru.","In Brazil, Praxair signed a long-term contract to supply industrial gases to a new steel mill being built near the Port of Pec\u00e9m in a recently created international free-trade zone in the Northeast region of Brazil. The mill will be operated by CSP, a joint venture between Brazil's Vale and South Korea's Dongkuk Steel and Posco Steel. Praxair will build, own and operate a 2,400-ton-per-day cryogenic plant that will produce gaseous and liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon. The plant will enable CSP to produce an expected 3 million tons of steel slabs annually, which will largely be exported for further processing by CSP's Korean partners. The plant is expected to start up in 2016.","The new plant will also serve merchant and packaged gas customers in a variety of sectors across the Northern and Northeast regions of Brazil, including food and beverage, metal fabrication, health care and automotive.","During the quarter, we also signed a long-term contract to build Peru's first overspent [ph] hydrogen plant for a petrochemical refiner which serves the local market. The new 12 million standard cubic foot per day steam methane reformer will be constructed near Lima and is expected to start up in 2016.","Currency translation of the Brazilian real is expected to be a full year headwind of more than 10%. 2014 consensus industrial production for Brazil is forecasted to be about 2%. Our 2014 outlook for Brazil volume growth is positive, although it is likely to be uneven, given the macroeconomic challenges such as infrastructure bottlenecks and rising inflation. However, we expect to continue to augment growth with applications technologies that bring productivity and environmental benefits to our customers, as well as growth through higher price.","Please turn to Slide 9 for our results in Asia. Sales of $394 million grew 5% versus the prior year quarter. Volume growth of 8% came primarily from higher on-site and merchant sales in China, India and Korea for metals, energy and electronics customers. More than half the growth was driven by new projects and the remainder from base business growth.","Asia's operating profit of $80 million increased 16% from the prior year quarter. Operating profit grew from higher volumes, productivity gains and also included a gain related to land sale in Korea of about $10 million.","Lower argon pricing in China and lower electronic processed gas pricing in Asia reduced sales by 1% from the prior year quarter. The Asian business has taken price increase actions in electronic gases and helium, as well as merchant products in Korea and India. However, liquid argon price in China continues to be pressured by supply growing faster than demand as large projects have come onstream. However, over time, this trend should reverse as demand growth with higher intensity of gas utilization and supply assets are rationalized.","During the quarter in China, we signed a long-term agreement expanding supply to Shaoguan Steel, a subsidiary of Baosteel Group. Praxair China has acquired an existing air separation plant previously owned and operated by Shaoguan Steel in South China, allowing Shaoguan to focus on its core steel production business. Praxair has been supplying gas to Shaoguan Steel for almost 15 years. Praxair will upgrade the 1,100-ton-per-day plant to meet its operational and reliability standards.","Praxair previously built and currently operates 3 air separation plants at the steel mill and will integrate the plant into our production system. The plant will increase Praxair's total production capacity to 3,200 tons of oxygen per day and will contribute to growth in 2014.","In addition, during the fourth quarter, we signed a long-term contract with Taewoong Steel to supply high-purity oxygen to the company's steel mill facility in Korea. Praxair will construct a new 180-ton-per-day air separation plant and pipeline in an industrial zone that will serve Taewoong as well as other new and existing pipeline and merchant liquid customers. The plant is expected to start up in 2016.","Proposal activity in Asia continues to be driven by longer-term secular needs and includes energy, wastewater treatment, metals, electronics and petrochemical end markets.","2014 project start-ups for Asia include plants to serve manufacturing in China and Korea, steel in India, electronics in Korea and chemicals in China. Our results for Surface Technologies are shown on Page 10.","Surface Technologies sales for the quarter were $164 million, up 1% compared to the prior year. The underlying sales growth came primarily from higher price, as energy sector coatings, including rotors, were steady and military aviation coatings decreased.","Operating profit was $27 million for the quarter.","And now I will turn the call back to Matt, who will discuss our outlook and earnings guidance for 2014.","Matthew J. White","Please turn to Page 11. For 2014, we expect the global economy to grow at a modest pace, in line with recent trends. In Southern Europe, volumes are stabilizing. And with our industry-leading position in North America, we remain well positioned to continue to take advantage of the attractive fundamentals for the energy, manufacturing and material industries.","In Brazil, growth should be positive, although uneven, given ongoing macroeconomic challenges. We are issuing full year EPS guidance of $6.25 to $6.55 for 2014, which represents 5% to 10% year-over-year growth, inclusive of expected negative currency translation effects.","Excluding currency, the guidance for 2014 is for sales growth of 6% to 10% and earnings per share growth of 9% to 14%, in line with our medium-term growth outlook.","Our guidance for the full year of 2014 is for sales to be in the range of $12.3 billion to $12.8 billion. Our range of sales growth assumes organic growth of 2% to 6%, including price. Excluding price, the range of volume growth is expected to be flat to 4%, depending on the strength of industrial activity in the regions in which we operate.","New projects will contribute about 3% top line growth for the year. At current exchange rates, our projected year-over-year sales face an estimated 3% headwind, primarily due to the Brazilian real, Mexican peso and Canadian dollar. We expect acquisitions to contribute about 1% top line growth, which includes existing acquisitions as well as those expected to close this year.","We anticipate a U.S. pension tailwind of approximately $0.05 per share, but this benefit will be mostly offset by higher interest expense.","Our earnings guidance for the first quarter is for EPS of $1.48 to $1.53, up 7% to 11%; and, excluding currency, up 11% to 15%.","Typically, our first quarter is the weakest of the calendar year due to seasonal slowdowns with the holidays in Brazil and China and refinery customer turnarounds. In addition, the recent adverse weather in North America has impacted volumes in the on-site, merchant and packaged businesses.","We expect capital spending to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. We are being selective and disciplined about the projects we pursue, only accepting those where we can bring a competitive advantage or get synergies with our existing infrastructure. This allows us to earn a high return on capital, which in turn produces higher cash flow that we will continue to return to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","In terms of your outlook, Matt, if I did the math for the new projects, does that translate to like $0.20, $0.25 of earnings growth this year?","Matthew J. White","Yes. Yes, it would be in that range, probably at the lower end of that range, but yes.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Is there any reason why it's a little bit lighter?","Matthew J. White","No. 20%, 25% from about a 3% growth.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just quickly looking at PDI, I was encouraged to see that business pick up a little bit. Are you seeing the momentum in that business in gases and rent continue to stay at those levels as we head into the first quarter?","Matthew J. White","Yes. We did see a good pickup, especially in the U.S. The U.S. packaged gas business, we were high single digit on gas, but still low negative on the hard goods. We have seen some sequential pickup there. Canada is still a bit of a bigger headwind. We're still seeing double-digit negative on the hard goods there, due more to their exposure to sort of heavy industry and mining. But for the U.S., we continue to see that pick up. And I think we're seeing a lot of stuff in research; spec gas, stronger spec gas activity; overall service improvement, especially in the Bakken area. And heavy industry is still flat. It's not declining as much. But overall, we're pretty happy with the trend this quarter.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I'm wondering if you could just look at the whole year of '13. You guys usually get really good leverage on sales growth, but sales growth and EPS growth were about the same. Can you kind of walk through what some of the takes were, where you didn't get that kind of the greater leverage on EPS versus sales growth?","Matthew J. White","Yes. Part of that, clearly, we had higher interest expense, so that was a bit of a headwind there for us. Also, when you look at some of the mix, especially in North America, the projects that did come onstream, we had some higher natural gas pass-through in North America. We also had more of a mix toward our hydrogen growth. And as you know, hydrogen for us, on a return basis, is equivalent to what we expect on the -- our atmospheric investments. But on an operating margin basis, it tends to be lower because of the natural gas pass-through. So we don't see any concerns in the trends overall, other than primarily just this mix issue.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, can you talk about -- are there meaningful differences in your incremental margins in the merchant business by geographies? So if you look Latin America, North America, Europe and Asia, are there meaningful differences there?","Matthew J. White","Nothing that's that significant, no. I mean, you'll tend to have, across the world, various customers that might be slightly higher or slightly lower margin depending upon the end application, but for the most part, no major difference.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","George D'Angelo - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","This is George D'Angelo sitting in for Laurence. Can you guys speak to the magnitude of weather headwinds in Q1 that you included in the outlook?","Matthew J. White","Well, the weather side, right now, it could be $0.01 to $0.02. The primary driver, our on-site customers actually had to shut down in several parts in the United States due to the weather conditions, and those you tend not to get back. In addition, we've seen some challenges in the packaged gas front with our customer base. Those we may get back. It just depends on whether we get it back this quarter or later in the year.","George D'Angelo - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And can you speak a little bit about merchant utilization rates?","Matthew J. White","Yes. Sure. U.S. -- North America, I should say, we're about 80%. We've kind of held in that area for most of the year. Looking to South America, we're in the mid 80s. Europe, Southern Europe is high 60s, touching in the 70. Northern Europe is more mid 70s, and in Asia, we're mid 80s. So look across the world, we've definitely got room to grow without capital additions, and any growth there should be highly accretive.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you talk about the $24 million in other income in the quarter and how it's distributed across your segments?","Matthew J. White","Sure. Normally, in other income, we tend to see maybe $5 million to $10 million just depending on the current -- what's going on in that quarter. But with this quarter, we had about $10 million related to the land sale in Asia, and then another part was the legal settlement in South America. Those were the 2 bigger drivers.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And in your earnings guidance, what's the magnitude of share repurchase that you assume?","Matthew J. White","Right now, we're in the range of 1% to 2%. So that's kind of what we've got baked in, is that range.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So $400 million to $800 million, or something like that?","Matthew J. White","In that neighborhood, yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about the loading rates of new projects, if you're seeing any improvement sequentially or how that's playing out?","Matthew J. White","Yes. I think, well, for '14, we're going to have several projects come on, kind of spread around the world. We'll have a couple in Russia. We've got a few in Asia, and then we've got a few in North America. So it's pretty well spread, and it's spread throughout the year. So overall, I think it's coming on fairly well.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I guess my question was more do you -- in the past, there has been an issue where the new facilities haven't ramped as fast as they did historically, and I'm just wondering if you're seeing any positive inflection in that trend?","Matthew J. White","For -- you mean for the merchant loadings and the credits?","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes. Yes.","Matthew J. White","Yes, I think that's more of a function in some of the more emerging markets, Asia especially. So we continue to see some ramp in those merchant credits. We're operating, like I said, in mid 80s on the utilization in Asia, so that gives you kind of an indication of the room we have to grow there. And that mid 80s obviously includes the new assets we've brought on that have merchant capacity.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then the turnaround impact you're anticipating for the year, is it similar to prior years, or is it more or less?","Matthew J. White","Probably a little bit more in the first half. We've got a large refinery turnaround that's baked into our Q1 assumption. And then we've got 2 other refinery turnarounds spread between Q2 and Q3, but I'd say nothing materially different than what we've seen in prior years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Matt, looking at North America margins in '14, given the impacts of currencies in Mexico and Brazil and natural gas prices, how do you think margin will look in North America over the course of 2014?","Matthew J. White","Well, I think from a currency perspective, that would just be more of a mix issue, obviously, if you have Mexico or Canada, depending on their weighting of margin. So maybe that would be a little bit dilutive. But really, as we continue to run full year impact of the hydrogen, that would create a little bit of a headwind on operating margins. But the remainder of the underlying business should continue to operate in the mid 20s for operating margin. So short of just this mix component and the mix of currency, I think we'll continue to operate at this level.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just on merchant, is your pricing fully offsetting your power and fuel costs? One of your competitors noted some margin pressure from a lag in those dynamics.","Matthew J. White","Yes. Obviously, I can't comment on the competitor, but from our perspective, we have a fairly robust recovery structure. And we don't -- and we haven't seen any issues in recovery of power or other costs.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Matt, is there any reason to expect an appreciable difference in incremental margins across the world as you start ramping up, assuming volumes come back? In other words, you mentioned, in Northern Europe, you're in sort of the mid 70s, and mid 80s in Asia. Would you expect any difference for incremental margins in those regions?","Matthew J. White","Yes. I think, as you add volume, clearly, that would be quite accretive because given the available capacity, we already have the drivers on the road. We already have the infrastructure in place. So as volumes are added, we would anticipate improving operating margins. If you look back to '08, you saw that trend in North America as we continue to improve the volume loadings from sort of a down-point in the crisis. When you look at Europe, South America, I think there's opportunities there. As we continue to load and they sort of continue to pull out of recessionary conditions, we'd anticipate some margin opportunity.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And a follow-up, if I might. On the NuCO2 business that you guys acquired, have you done anything different in terms of their go-to-market or sourcing any of the logistics they do, the SAPs, or is that pretty much running as it was on its own prior to your acquisition?","Matthew J. White","Clearly, we had some synergies. And the synergies are -- range everything from standard cost synergies of -- that we always see in our acquisitions, plus the CO2 supply. So we were able to transition and get more logistical benefits and better CO2 supply with our network. And we're looking to further improve integration with our packaged business. So it's something that we are improving on, and it's performing better than our model in virtually all aspects.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Yes, 2 questions, one on the backlog, on that $2.2 billion. How much of that is North America? And within North America, is it still heavily weighted towards hydrogen? Or with the 3 hydrogen start-ups this year, is it a little more evenly balanced?","Matthew J. White","Well, I think when you look at the backlog geographically, we're about 1\/3 North America, 1\/3 Asia, and the remaining 1\/3 is roughly split between South America and Europe, with a large portion of Europe being Russia. When you sort of look at the end markets, it's about 1\/3 energy, 1\/3 manufacturing, and the remainder is between metals, chemicals and electronics. So obviously, we had 2 large hydrogen projects coming out of the backlog. North America is kind of split across really the variety of end markets that I had mentioned. So I'd say it's still fairly well distributed.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then as you talk about a $0.20 contribution this year from new projects to earnings per share, what could that be in 2015?","Matthew J. White","Well, generally, we anticipate top line 3% to 4%. And I'd say the EPS associated with that could be anywhere from 20% to 30%. So that's kind of the range.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Manthey with Robert W. Baird.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","You mentioned a $0.01 to $0.02 potential impact from weather in the first quarter of '14. And there were clearly some holidays, and there was some harsh weather late in the fourth quarter of '13. Not to get too microscopic here, but was there any impact from weather, do you think, in the fourth quarter as well?","Matthew J. White","Not too much on weather, definitely holidays. Our South American, we do tend to see, in that seasonal slowdown during the holidays, they sort of do opportunistic shutdowns. So we did see that, but it's come out of that here in January. But other than normal seasonal holiday patterns, we didn't see any material weather in the fourth quarter.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then can you discuss the competitive landscape in particularly the hard goods side of PDI? Are you seeing any pressure from manufacturers selling direct or unusually competitive pricing from other large distributors?","Matthew J. White","No. I wouldn't say we're seeing anything out of the normal of what we normally see. I think what you've got going on to some extent in hard goods, some of the very hard good-intensive industries like heavy industry and mining are simply not as strong as they used to be. So I think that's creating a bit of a dampening effect across all hard goods. But we're not seeing anything different than normal activity.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Matt, I was wondering if you could comment on the changes in proposal activity that you're seeing kind of upstream of your confirmed projects? The commentaries seem to indicate you're seeing strength across all 3 modes in North America, and you called out Northern Europe, Russia and certain end-use markets in Asia as well. So I'm just kind of trying to think ahead and wondering whether we might have seen a bottom in the backlog -- or a trough in the backlog with some opportunity for growth looking ahead.","Matthew J. White","Sure, Kevin. I think when you look across the on-site opportunities, the strongest 2 regions are still North America and Asia, as well as Russia, specifically. I think in North America, there's a lot of activity around the Gulf Coast, but decisions are understandably taking longer. There's higher construction costs there, and there's some uncertainty just around what the oil to gas spreads may be or how the capacity will need to come onstream. So I think our customers are being very thoughtful, and they're doing a lot of analysis to make sure they pull -- before they pull any trigger on projects. Asia, also a lot of activity, but with the change in government and some of the state-owned enterprise leadership changing, coupled with some of the environmental regulations, you're seeing just a little more time before they're going to make decisions. For instance, some of these projects, they may need to meet certain environmental regulations before they can get funding to do incremental investments. So that will all weigh down on some of the timing, but we're still seeing fairly strong activity in those 2 regions. And South America, we had been seeing some smaller opportunities still budding around the country. We just signed CSP, which I think is a great example of leveraging some of the cheaper iron ore in Brazil, taking advantage of the free trade zone and some of the opportunities that brings to make slabs for the Korean market.","Kelcey E. Hoyt","Okay. And Kevin, it's Kelcey. As we think about the backlog, we do expect it to hover around that $2 billion. So even though we bumped up to $2.2 billion this quarter, it's just a function of when we actually started some plants up and when we actually signed these customer contracts.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's helpful. Second question, Matt, if I may, on foreign exchange. Just simply, which currencies, if any, are you hedging these days?","Matthew J. White","Well, I think at a balance sheet perspective, we've always continued to hedge. What we do not do is the -- what's called net income hedging. That was discontinued probably about a year ago or so. Obviously, we continue to evaluate the currencies, and we look for ways to mitigate our exposure. But we don't have those net income hedges anymore.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then last one, if I may, on hydrogen. Do your contracts typically contain provisions for efficiencies that might create a small benefit with higher natural gas prices that could act as an offset to some of the weather-related pressure that you referenced, or is that not the case?","Matthew J. White","Yes. Generally, obviously, every hydrogen contract will be different. But normally, you will have some type of contractual gas-to-hydrogen ratio. And if you are able to do better than that in how you operate the plant, that could be something that you're able to retain. And the higher the natural gas pricing, the bigger that benefit.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Matt, you had a nice operating income pickup in Europe. Margins were up 200 basis points. How much of that came from new start-ups and acquisitions versus cost-cutting that you've previously started?","Matthew J. White","Well, I think in Europe, looking back, you go back several years prior to the crisis, we had some pretty strong operating margins. And there's a few things that have kind of brought it down. First and foremost, just the lack of volume with the recessionary conditions. As that volume was lost, it fell quite heavy to the operating margin line. In addition, with Russia, we've been ramping up there, as you know, adding a lot of cost and a lot of overhead to be able to execute and build our projects there. So what we're starting to see now is some stabilization in the volumes, even a little bit of pickup in some parts. With Russia, we're starting to bring some projects online, and this year, we'll have a couple we'll bring online. So with that sort of improving, that's what's causing some of the margin improvement. And that's why we think we'll stay in the high teens in operating margin, and that's our outlook into 2014.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And you mentioned chemical projects are kicking into higher gear in North America. Can you just talk about how many projects are in the bidding process in the U.S? And what's the potential there? And make a similar comment about coal to chemicals in China?","Matthew J. White","Well, I think in the U.S. side, it's just there's more bidding activity than we have resources to go chase. I think that's probably the easiest way to look at it. So we're focusing on a few key ones where we have the best ability to add value and get a return that fits our criteria. So we're working, as you can imagine, down the whole hydrocarbon chain on various projects. And I think, over time, we'll start to see some of these converted into contracts in the next year. Now looking at China, clearly, they're still trying to take advantage of their coal feedstock, and there's still a lot of activity in -- and I'll call it the Inner Mongolia part, where you've got the push from the coal gasification from the coal companies. That, we're not really participating in too much, but we continue to participate more along the coasts, where you see coal to chemicals for some of the major multinational chemical companies. So that activity still is good, and we've started up a few already. We've got a couple more we're starting up that are in our backlog, and we're still seeing some activity around the chemical parts.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","All right, totally, just quickly, I would just follow up on the project backlog question. I think project backlog in 4Q went from $2 billion to $2.2 billion, so it actually went up when it was expected to go down. So that's the good news. And I think you mentioned that you added 3 projects and took out 6 projects out of the backlog, and the backlog went up. So is the size of the projects going up?","Matthew J. White","Yes. Yes, you're exactly right. We took out 6 and added 3, but the net number went up. So on a dollar basis, the 3 were slightly larger than the 6 that came out.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Gulley with BGC Financial.","Mark R. Gulley - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. One, in Brazil, generally speaking, a weak currency has had a positive impact on their competitiveness, and that should lead to more demand, let's say, for exports. Is that going to happen this time, or are the internal dynamics in Brazil still kind of sluggish?","Matthew J. White","Yes, Mark, it's a good question. It's hard to give a definitive answer. But I think, Brazil, most of their exports are natural resources and agricultural products, and that should make this beneficial. With our recent project here with CSP, that will make it more cost effective for Vale's ore to go into the steel. In addition, Braskem recently stated about a week or so ago that this weaker real will make them more competitive on chemicals, and they anticipate stronger exports for them to grow faster than the sort of estimated 2% IP. So I think certain industries clearly should benefit from this. The big question for us in Brazil, and this is why we sort of look at it as uneven, is there's a couple of macroeconomic headwinds, they've raised interest rates, but there's also some positive underlying aspects, infrastructure projects around elections and, just to your point, some export opportunities.","Mark R. Gulley - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And secondly, switching geographies here, you have -- Russia has come up a couple of times. You talked about it in your prepared remarks, a lot of volatility, a lot of uncertainty, a lot of things going on in that part of the world. Has that lessened your appetite to expand in Russia? Or did you kind of see that going in, and you're just going to live with it?","Matthew J. White","Yes. Clearly, when we went in, we anticipated volatility. We have to bake that into our contract terms and conditions as well as our expected returns. So looking at Russia, I'd say we were more than pleasantly surprised with the opportunities, greater than what we thought. I think execution on the ground was a little more difficult than we thought. But we're learning with each project and we're getting better. And I think from all respects, the way we structured contracts, we've more than anticipated this type of volatility.","Mark R. Gulley - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","And if I can, going back to Brazil, price offset some of the currency weakness. With the 10% currency hit you see this year, can you get more price this year?","Matthew J. White","Yes. Generally, our -- I mean, we're clearly going to go after more price. Our price is more of a function of local inflation and also contractual opportunities. But yes, we definitely will continue, we believe, to get strong pricing in South America. I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Back to the backlog question again. Slide 14 has the 14 largest projects in the backlog, but I think you said there's 32 projects total in the backlog. So what percent would these largest 14 projects be at the dollar value? Is there an 80-20 rule here, that projects that you actually list account for, let's say, 80% of the dollar value?","Matthew J. White","Yes, clearly, these 14 would be more than half, but I don't have the exact number. But it would be more than half of the dollar value.","Kelcey E. Hoyt","Yes. And John, I mean -- it's Kelcey. I mean, the ones that we show here on and have listed on the slide, they're the ones we've done press releases on. So from time to time, you have a situation where a customer doesn't want to be named in a press release. So it's not really just a function of the size, it's also just the press release and what's publicly out there.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","That's right. I noticed some of them are smaller projects. And then the electronics industry performance data on Slide 15 seemed a little weaker than what we've seen at your products in DuPont, Dow and some of the other companies with electronics exposure. Is there any reason why you might be lagging a little bit there?","Matthew J. White","Well, I think, for us, electronics is probably about 8% of our sales. About half of that is really on-site high-purity nitrogen. So that half really doesn't move that much with the underlying electronic conditions. So only the other half of the portion is something that I'd say is a little more volatile, so to speak. And that really serves about 3\/4 in the semiconductor and the remainder sort of between the solar and the display. So from our view, we're not that exposed to electronics, and of the portion that we are, we just didn't drop as hard, I think. And we are seeing some recovery in semiconductors, especially memory. But for the most part, we're kind of flat.","Kelcey E. Hoyt","Thank you. Okay. And thanks again for participating in our fourth quarter earnings call. Our first quarter earnings call will be held on April 23. And if you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to me directly. Thank you.","Matthew J.

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today, Juan Pelaez. You may begin, sir.","Juan Pelaez - Praxair, Inc.","Thanks, Nova. Good morning, and thank you for attending our Third Quarter Earnings Call and Webcast. I am joined this morning by Steve Angel, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer; Matt White, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and Kelcey Hoyt, Vice President and Controller.","Today's presentation materials are available on our website at praxair.com in the Investor section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on page two of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference.","In addition, please note that our discussions of earnings for the third quarter, including year-over-year and sequential comparisons, excludes charges taken related to cost reduction actions. The reconciliation to the U.S. GAAP reported numbers are in the Appendix of the presentation and the press release.","I'd like now to turn the call over to Steve.","Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.","Thanks, Juan. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to cover three areas before I turn it over to Matt. I'm going to review what we are seeing around the world. I'm going give you an update on the implementation of our strategy, which I reviewed with you this time last year, and I have a few comments on the discussions we held with Linde about a potential merger.","I'll start with the U.S., which is very much a mixed bag. Our volumes to the chemical industry continued to be healthy as Varian markets are more diverse and consumer-driven. Hydrogen volumes to refiners are starting to moderate as diesel demand weakens and refinery margins compress. This is offset somewhat by higher hydrogen intensity as refiners are turning to sour feedstocks to boost margins.","Food and beverage volumes in the U.S. are strong. I'll comment more on that later. Our volumes into the steel mills along the Great Lakes are softening as auto production, which makes up about 28% of their end market sales, is coming down off of peak production rates. I expect this trend to stay with us until either energy or non-resi construction demand can pick up the slack or global excess supply is rationalized.","The bigger worry card for us is manufacturing, where we saw weak volumes in July and August, especially in our packaged gas business. September did improve sequentially, but given the general weakness observed in Q3, we were forced to make adjustments to our cost structure. And I'll speak more to that later.","Canada remains a tale of two markets, as growth in healthcare and food and beverage in the East helps mitigate the drop in energy-related volumes experienced in the West. Mexico, ex-energy, continues to grow at a healthy mid-single digit pace, as the manufacturing sector continues to favor Mexico as a preferred hub to serve North America. Our volumes into the oil well services sector are almost nonexistent today, as Pemex continues to struggle with low energy prices and their own internal issues.","The economy in Brazil seems to have bottomed, albeit at a low level. By focusing on growth in non-industrial markets, such as healthcare and food and beverage and new applications, we were able to generate growth while our traditional metals and manufacturing markets remain quite weak. We did benefit this last quarter from a project start-up and decap in the metal sector.","Far be it from me to predict the turn in Brazil's economy. My personal view is that will not happen until inflation can be brought under control and interest rates lowered to stimulate domestic demand and the government decides to spend less on themselves and more on needed infrastructure, neither of which I expect to see in the immediate future.","With that as a backdrop, we thought it necessary to take additional actions to better align our cost structure with the market reality. Could I be too pessimistic about Brazil's economy? Perhaps. But I would rather plan for no improvement and be pleasantly surprised if things turn around sooner than expected.","Europe is performing better overall. Our pipeline businesses serving steel and petrochemical customers in Spain, Germany and the Benelux continue to do well. Spain continues to re-emerge from a deep recession. Italy remains weak, but we are able to capitalize on small acquisitions there to build density and expand our homecare business. Germany and the Benelux is more steady-state, while Scandinavia remains challenged by the pull-back in energy investment. But, overall, Europe is better than it has been in quite some time.","Turning to Asia. China's underlying economy is growing at a mid-single digit pace. Consumer-driven activity, namely, electronics, healthcare and environmental solutions, has replaced fixed asset investment activity as the best prospects for growth. Though nothing transformative has taken place yet in India with respect to much-needed infrastructure investment, our core business continues to grow at a healthy mid-single digit pace.","In Korea, electronics is growing modestly, while the export-oriented manufacturing sector continues to struggle. Thailand, where we are focused on the growth of our CO2 business into food and beverage and energy end markets, continues to do well.","Turning to page five. The first prong of our strategy is to optimize the base business. This is all about operational discipline and execution, without which we would not have been able to deliver the solid cash flow we reported this quarter. Matt will speak more to this in his comments.","We continue to make solid gains in our resilient market growth focus. The objective is to grow our exposure to more resilient markets from about a quarter of our total sales to about a third. Included in this segment would be food and beverage, healthcare, aerospace, and specialty gases, many of which are used in environmental applications.","I want to touch on just a few of these areas. We closed our Yara CO2 acquisition in June, which gives us an excellent platform to grow our food and beverage business in Continental Europe and the UK. That acquisition is off to an excellent start. We continue to add CO2 sources in the U.S. to further penetrate the food and beverage market and to keep up with the growth of our new CO2 business, which is the beverage carbonation service we acquired in 2013. Over the last three years, we have increased our CO2 capacity in the U.S. by almost 50%. Today, CO2 represents about 10% of our total sales and is growing in the mid to high-single digit range globally.","In healthcare, we have seen excellent growth in Canada, Mexico, South America and Southern Europe, both organically and through small acquisitions. In China, we had avoided hospital gases historically due to our own concerns over corruption. However, given the effectiveness of the government's new anti-corruption campaign, we have stepped-up our efforts to penetrate this market and we are starting to see nice growth, albeit off a low base.","Earlier this month, we closed our joint venture with GE on aircraft engine coatings. Our expectation is that between increased scope, share gain and the production ramp of the GE LEAP engine, our coatings sales with GE will triple over the next three to four years to over $200 million in sales.","Project activity in the U.S. Gulf Coast remains robust. Based on what we have signed and to be announced, I fully expect to start the new year with $1.5 billion in the backlog, two-thirds of which is in the U.S. Gulf Coast. As a result, project contributions, which have been low over the last several years, should contribute on average 3% per year to the bottom line from 2017 to 2020.","Between continued weakness in manufacturing across the Americas, a pull-back in project activity in emerging markets, the need to reduce overhead cost in our Asia operations and the desire to accelerate cost benefits from our two Yara acquisitions, we have implemented a restructuring program resulting in a Q3 charge of $96 million. We expect this action to generate $45 million in annualized cost savings.","We know that many of the headwinds we are facing will abate and more than likely turn back in our favor at some point, though the when is hard to predict. What I have described to you is how we will grow profitably regardless of macro environment. My expectation is this strategy will produce mid-single digit top line and that or better bottom line over the next several years, assuming constant currency and no help from base volumes. Of course, any base volume recovery will fall through heavily to the bottom line, given, in most cases, we have sufficient capacity already in place to accommodate growth.","My last comment will be on the potential Linde merger. First of all, we have not had any discussions with them since we announced that talks were terminated. It was reported that we could not reach agreement on the role of Linde's headquarters. The fact is, discussions were halted before we had a chance to fully vet that subject. Would I be open to resuming discussions? The answer is yes, but there's no guarantee that that will happen, and, if it does, there's no guarantee that we will reach an agreement.","I have been asked about the strategic logic of this combination. First of all, our complementary geographical positions would allow us to leverage the individual strengths of each company, Linde's technology and engineering and Praxair's operational excellence, and do that across a much greater footprint. The combined portfolio would be more balanced and resilient than either standalone. The expected synergies would be compelling. The resulting balance sheet would be robust, with strong cash flow as a result of the expected synergies. Obviously, we felt any potential divestitures were manageable, otherwise we would not have pursued this opportunity.","How do we evaluate the attractiveness of this potential deal? The answer is the value of half of the combined company, including synergies, must be significantly greater than our standalone case. Why significantly? Because of the inherent risk involved. However, that could have been mitigated by ensuring upfront that leadership is unambiguous and the company is operated in a clear and consistent way. This is all I have to say on the subject. As stated at the onset, we are confident in our base strategy and remain fully committed to its implementation.","I'll now turn it over to Matt to discuss third quarter results and our outlook.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Thanks, Steve. Please turn to slide seven for an overview of our third quarter results. Sales at $2.7 billion are 1% above prior year and 2% above the second quarter. Looking year-over-year, ongoing price improvements of 1% and contributions from the Yara acquisition of 1% are partially offset by a 1% headwind from foreign currency translation. As exchange rates stabilize, we're finally starting to lap the FX headwinds we've experienced over the last few years.","Volume growth is flat as project gains and organic improvements in our defensive end markets are offset by lower volumes in manufacturing and upstream energy. Sequentially, we have the benefit of a full quarter from the Yara acquisition, but we're also seeing natural gas pass-through up 1%, which doesn't materially impact operating profit dollars, but does dilute operating margins by 20 basis points. This sequential effect is even greater in our North American segment, negatively affecting the segment operating margin by 50 basis points.","Operating profit of $597 million is 4% below prior year and 2% above last quarter. Third quarter operating margin of 22% is in-line with the second quarter, but 100 basis points below last year. This decline is primarily driven by North American manufacturing and upstream energy volume declines, especially in the packaged gas business, where we've lost variable margin without corresponding overhead costs.","This is why we undertook the cost reduction effort this quarter, to better align our businesses with market trends. This action resulted in annualized savings of $45 million from a reduction of about 730 employees, with almost half in the North American segment.","Earnings per share for the quarter are $1.41. Note that this excludes $100 million operating cost or $0.23 per share related to the cost actions and a pension settlement charge. EPS increased from the second quarter, as project contribution and cost management efforts more than offset manufacturing weakness and normal seasonal declines in Europe. As Steve mentioned, we're executing the strategy, and the cash flow generation is a good example of our success.","Operating cash flow $788 million is 17% above last year and 12% above last quarter. This figure represents 29% of sales, which is one of our highest quarters ever. So despite some of the macroeconomic challenges, our employees continued to prudently control capital. In fact, third quarter free cash flow of over $400 million enabled us to reduce net debt this quarter by almost $200 million, essentially eliminating our debt increase last quarter from the acquisitions.","In addition to strong cash generation, we continue to position the business for future growth. The project backlog increased to $1.4 billion, as new on-site projects in the U.S., South Korea and Brazil more than offset the start-ups this quarter in Peru in Europe. We are particularly pleased the opportunities in the U.S. Gulf Coast to build off our asset network for both atmospheric and process gases. We recently executed a contract to supply oxygen and nitrogen to MEGlobal for their new ethylene glycol plant in Freeport, Texas. We won this contract by leveraging our pipeline network to deliver high reliability at a competitive cost. In fact, we feel confident in our ability to announce additional U.S. Gulf Coast project wins by the end of this year. In summary, we continue to see the benefits of executing our strategy through improved cash generation, key project wins and portfolio enhancements.","I'd now like to briefly cover guidance on page eight. Fourth quarter EPS guidance is in the","range of $1.36 to $1.43. The midpoint of this range is roughly flat with the third quarter.","This guidance assumes that full quarter project contribution and benefits from the cost action","are offset by weaker U.S. metals and more negative seasonal effects in South America.","Q4 last year was quite weak for both metals and South America due to extended outages, and","we believe we may see similar trends this year. The full-year guidance range is $5.44 to $5.51. The midpoint is about $0.05 lower than the prior guidance. This reduction is primarily due to weaker than anticipated manufacturing and metals volumes, especially in North America.","We're actively working to improve upon this number, but there simply aren't enough positive signs to predict any volume recovery at this time. But rest assured, we'll continue to execute the strategy of profitable growth independent of the economic environment. And finally, before we open up the line, I just want to remind everyone that we don't have any further comments to make on the terminated Linde merger, so I appreciate your efforts to refrain from any questions on this topic.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of","John Roberts of UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. You have much of your business under volume contracts. When you go down below, for example, the PEMEX business you talked about that's almost nil right now, are you booking revenue without supplying volumes? Or do the contracts get renegotiated or somehow extended?","Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.","Well, those are merchant liquid contracts with PEMEX. And there is no take or pay, it's just a requirements contract. So as they use the volume, they pay for it. The margins are quite high, but today the volumes are quite low. As a matter of fact, if I look at the volume trend, it's down about 80% year-over-year. So lower revenue, lower margin. We have adjusted to get the cost more in line with what we're seeing currently from PEMEX. But that's the way that's managed.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Is there a way to think about what percent of your business is at minimum contract volumes for where you do have both on the bulk gas and the merchant liquid, some sort of volume commitment in your contract?","Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.","So on the onsite business, practically all of that would have some take-or-pay commitment. So if you think of that as roughly 30% of our sales, that's all under take-or-pay. The merchant liquid contracts typically are requirements contracts, which just means whatever volume they consume, they must consume it from us and they must consume it at the agreed-to price.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","And I was asking is there a meaningful percent that's actually bottomed out here at your minimums?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","John, it's Matt. No. As we've stated before, South America has several running below the m-tops just given the conditions there. But other than that, you'll just see spotty areas around the world based on certain turnarounds or other seasonal effects, but nothing that material.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Sheehan of SunTrust.","James M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Could you comment on your full year 2017 outlook, or I should say just going forward over the next 12 months, what is your assumption for share buybacks within that?","Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.","Well, we're not going give specific guidance on 2017 yet. We have another quarter to go. We'll do that the end of January. We're going to look very closely at that. We would like to be back in the market reducing our share count, at a minimum we offset any dilution that we see. But we're going to wait to see how the quarter finishes, the year starts. But we would certainly like to be back in the market reducing share count again.","James M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Do you have a target for net debt to EBITDA in 2017 or 2018?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","I wouldn't say there's any specific target, James. Our primary objective regarding that is to stay within our current credit rating. So from that perspective, we might improve on that ratio a little bit here in the next couple quarters. But no specific target.","James M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Harrison of Seaport Global.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Morning.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Was wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on the North American metals weakness? I thought that we had been seeing some benefits there from the tariff activity that's gone on.","Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.","We did. We saw some benefits in Q2 that lasted through Q3. But as we were looking at the weekly volume trends, we started to see some weakness as some of our major steel customers along the Great Lakes started taking, I'll call it, more extended outages. And what we can conclude from looking at their end markets is that there's a concern about softening automotive demand. Clearly, Ford's volumes are down. They just announced earnings.","So it's more of a concern over just weaker automotive. And that's the assumption we're making at this point that that trend's going to continue. Obviously, if we're wrong about that, there will be some upside. But right now, the assumption is that the weakening oxygen volumes to the steel mills are going to continue to be soft because of softening automotive.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","And is North America still relatively better than other regions throughout the world in terms of steel, or is that no longer the case?","Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.","I would say looking around the world, Europe is in pretty good shape. The mills in northern Spain, the mills in southern Germany are very good mills for those companies. And they continue to produce, supporting both automotive and the growth in other steel sectors. So I would say Europe is more positive than it's been.","Obviously, in South America there's a lot of weakness in metals generally speaking. Those volumes for the entire steel industry are down about 10% to 15% year-over-year. If I were to go to India, the metals volumes are up. If I were to go to China, I'd say the volumes are flat. And so while Q3 volumes year-over-year looked pretty decent in North America, we did start to see a softening trend. And, again, we concluded that's because of weaker automotive demand.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right. And then you talked a little bit about the CO2 focus. You've done the NuCO2 business and the Yara acquisition. Your competitors got the EPCO business a few years back. Are there other regional CO2 businesses that would make sense for you to add globally? And can you also update us on how you're leveraging the new CO2 business in Brazil and in other countries?","Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.","Yes, so we've added CO2 businesses not that long ago in Brazil when we started up this hydrogen plant. In Peru recently, there is a CO2 off take as part of that project. We continue to look for CO2 sources in Asia. We'd really like to get our food and beverage business in Asia cranked up. So the answer is yes, we'll continue to look for good CO2 sources around the world.","And the real key criteria there is that you have to have a high quality source. It has to be competitive. It has to be a reliable source. And if you can capture those, you're in a great position to continue to grow from that source in that local market. If I look at new CO2, we have replicated that model in Brazil quite successfully. We've replicated that model throughout North America, in Mexico and Canada, and we're still looking at opportunities to do that in Europe as we speak.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. Two questions. First, can you give a little bit of extra color on the trends in North America packaged gases? I mean, is that down high-single digits? And is the rest of the balance of North America a positive, or what's the dynamic there?","Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.","So the U.S. packaged gas business year-over-year is down mid-single digits. The gas part, I'll call it gas, rent and other, is down low-single digits. Hard goods is down mid-teens. And that's year-over-year. And then sequentially it's down low-single digits.","So as you'll recall, we had a fairly nice step-up Q2 over Q1 in the packaged gas business. We were hoping that was going to continue through Q3, possibly grow. What happened in July and August \u2013 and I've heard other vendors talk about this \u2013 it just was very, very weak in July and August. And September did get a little better sequentially, but not enough to really give us a lot of optimism in terms of the run rates. That's why we decided to take the cost actions that we did.","What's behind that? Obviously, the whole energy supply chain continued to draw down throughout the course of the year. Commodities continued to be weak. Ag continues to be weak. Any producer that's driven by exports is penalized by the strong dollar, so mining continues to be weak. So just not enough going on from an end market standpoint.","We do have some positive segments obviously. Specialty gases does better, hospitals does better, others like that. But the major end markets that are metal fabrication driven \u2013 rail car production was off. You heard me talk earlier about diesel demand being weaker. That's because less product is being moved from coast-to-coast.","So that whole sector has been weak. And essentially what we did, we just carried that run rate forward into Q4 and assumed that we weren't going to see any help in Q4. And quite possibly, as we get closer to the holidays, we may start to see extended shutdowns in the U.S. and probably will in Brazil. But we may start to see that in the U.S. as well.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","And then I guess secondly, the strength year-over-year in food and beverage, was there just a couple of projects that came on-stream, or what drove that?","Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.","It's been a focus, Laurence. It's great when you've got a strategy that actually gets implemented. In this case, that's what's happened around the world. And a lot of it has to do with working on finding good CO2 sources, which we've been able to do in the U.S. You heard me talk about this earlier in other parts of the world.","And then just focusing on continuing to develop that segment. Take applications, like the new CO2 business model, migrate that where we can. So while our core markets have been very weak and we've been talking about that, markets like food and beverage and healthcare have been there for us. They're not too far afield from what we've been doing historically. So we just put a big focus on it and we're starting to see some benefits.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Steve, on the M&A front ex-Linde, as packaged gas demand slows, are you seeing increased opportunities on the M&A front in U.S. packaged gases?","Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.","I wouldn't say necessarily increasing. We always have a pipeline of opportunities that we're going through. I think what typically happens, these are family-owned businesses. They always want to sell at the peak. They always want to sell when they have their peak EBITDAs and get out right before the downturn. Well, they were too late to do that. And so I would say that the pipeline of opportunities has been about the same. It's the same today as it's been pretty much all year. And we have a few things we're working on and hopefully we'll have some things to talk about going forward.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Fair enough. And also, are you seeing any opportunities in buying ASUs or other people with hydrogen plants on a one-off basis?","Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.","These are things we work on all the time. It's like you've heard me talk about acquisitions. You look at 20 to do two. And you always have to be careful whenever a customer all the sudden wants to talk to you about a decap, which a lot of times is a leading indicator they're having cash flow problems.","But these are things that we look at if there's enough value that can be created between energy efficiency, perhaps merchant liquid offtake, increased reliability, those types of things. If there's enough value that can be created, then there's a chance that we can go forward and do something like a decap. But if they start the discussion or the conversation off with, you've got to do better than my cost of capital. Well, I'm not interested in that. We're not a bank.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Understood. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson of Credit Suisse.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you. Manufacturing in the U.S. appeared to be stabilizing a little bit last quarter, but it appears that there's a little more of a bit of a slowdown or some choppiness in 3Q. Can you just comment on how this has trended over the last few months, particularly versus some of the shut-ins you saw within refinery and steel? Then just general expectations as we head into 2017.","Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.","Well, it's a lot like I commented on earlier. July and August was very weak. September a little better. I talked about the end market trends that's affecting that. We're much more exposed to metal fabrication. So when you look at that overall Investor Production Report, you've got to go down there and look at the sub-lines to really understand what's going on.","And from the steel perspective, I think it's what we've been saying since the beginning of time. It's so important to select the right project with the right customer to make sure that the asset that you're going be supplying over a long-term contract is a competitive asset on a world scale. And where we've got all those decisions right, we've worked very hard to do that historically, things are fine. They're operating. They're paying their take-or-pays. But if we ever got a feel from that, and we haven't fortunately, then we've seen some people suffer from plants that have been idled or shut down.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect. And just a quick follow-up. You've continued to outperform the macro in Brazil. And obviously it seems that F&B and healthcare appear to be doing well in the region. Can you just comment a little more about the sequential trends and then just the general outlook that you're seeing across Latin America? Is it basically just bouncing off the bottom, but not necessarily getting worse? And do you expect that to even get modestly better in 2017? Thank you.","Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.","It's a great question. I wish I could give you a highly competent answer. I'll just tell you that we saw the manufacturing continue to weaken in Brazil. There are pockets of Brazil that do okay. Pulp and paper does fine. Obviously, Embraer, that we don't supply a lot to, but they do fine. Agriculture does fine. People that are shipping slabs, steel slabs, out of Brazil to go to other places, those volumes are fine.","But we did continue to see the manufacturing sector continue to weaken. Our concern and what's reflected in the guidance that Matt gave is, as we go into the holidays, they'll do what they did last year. They'll take extended shutdowns beginning early December. It might not come up that quickly.","So the good news is we've removed the political instability. You now have President Temer and so we don't have all that drama. But then again, they have some work to do. Interest rates \u2013 the SELIC rate is 14%. Inflation is like 8% or 9%. So that needs to be brought under control. That is their intention. As they do that, we expect to see the economy rebound. But that needs to happen.","And the people that I talk to on the ground in Brazil, and I'm focusing all my comments on Brazil, believe that 2017 will be a little better because they believe it's bottomed. So I think it remains to be seen. And I want to watch it very carefully this quarter and beginning next year.","But in terms of what needs to happen, say, to get our operating margins back to a 20% range is we need some lift in manufacturing, which is merchant liquid business, that's the packaged gas business, and that's very much tied to manufacturing. Just to give you a couple of indicators, automotive production is down 40% over the last two years. 40%. Capital goods are down 35%. So that feels like those have bottomed, but they're extremely low levels. So hopefully north is the only direction we can go from here, but it remains to be seen.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That's great detail. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Sison of KeyBanc Capital.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, guys. Steve, when you think about 2017, it sounded like in your opening remarks that you feel better about getting earnings growth back on task with new projects and cost savings and your strong free cash flow. Any color when you think about 2017? I know it's a little bit early, but just on what you can control to grow earnings next year?","Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.","Yeah, I'll give you a little bit. But, again, we'll really want to see fourth quarter and really want to see the start of the year because the wild card really is base volume. And it's not just base volume, it's the composition of the base volume, because not all volume is created equal from a profitability standpoint.","When your oil well services is off 80%, that's high-margin business. Brazil manufacturing weak, that's high-margin business. Metals that we serve off our oxygen pipeline, that's all high-margin business. So the run rates that we're going to see and expect to see are going be very important in terms of how we think about profitability next year. So it's not just the absolute base volume number. It's the composition of the base volume.","But just a couple other things I'll add to that. Obviously, we're going to have some benefit from the restructuring actions that we just took, and $45 million will translate to about a 2% EPS lift. We're going to have greater contributions from large projects than we've had in prior years. Now, a lot of that is second half \u2013 well, just about all of it is second half loaded. But assuming they come up when I believe they will, and we have very strong contracts there that will protect us, that will be stronger contribution than we've seen.","Acquisitions will be higher just on a carryover basis from the Yara acquisitions. And then price, we always seem to find a way to eke out at least a percent. That will be my expectation going forward next year. So I think the wild card is going to be the base volume run rate, the composition of the base volume, and we should assume from that when we give you guidance.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. And as a follow-up, it does sound like the backlog is getting a little bit better...","Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.","Yes.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","...at least sequentially as we head into the end of the year. Can you maybe talk about \u2013 you did note that Gulf Coast looks pretty good in terms of activity. Any other areas in the world that activity's picking up?","Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.","No. I don't mean to be so curt, but I don't. The U.S. Gulf Coast, that's a secular-driven activity. These projects have been in the works for years. We've been working on them for years and it's based on low-cost natural gas and it's based on the infrastructure being there in place and just the strength of the opportunity slate that we have. I'd say to-date, two-thirds of the backlog when we start off the year is going to be in the U.S. Gulf Coast. That percent's I project is going go up over the next couple years.","So unless the commodity markets reverse and you see some dramatic improvement in economic activity in some of the emerging markets around the world, I really don't expect to see hardly anything in the way of new proposal activity, other than maybe a refinery project here or there as places in Asia and also in other parts of the world need more transportation fuels, cleaner fuel, all of that. I expect we might see some refinery opportunities.","But as far as core ASUs that are tied to some of the basic markets that we supply, I really don't expect to see much in the way of activity. And you've heard me say this, I don't think China needs another plant of any kind. I think they have enough capacity for a long time.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.","Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. Just a question on the restructuring. It sounds like from your answers to a different question that the slowdown in activity recently was the catalyst that drove the restructuring program. And I'm just wondering, as you think about the size of that and you'd also made some comments about not wanting to do too much, is there a phase two of restructuring that could potentially come if the environment doesn't get better as we move through 2017? Or how should we be thinking about that?","Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.","I think if the environment stays where it is, there would not be any other action. And I really do not want to take another action. We took one last year and we had to do it again this year because of just the extreme weakness that we saw in South America. And Matt already made his comments in the U.S., other parts of the world. So there's not a phase-two plan.","I think you always have to realize that the world can change, markets can change. And you can never really say you would not do another restructuring because you're going have to react to whatever the market gives you. But based on what I see today, I don't expect, or there would not be a phase two to what we just announced.","Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just a quick one on pricing in LatAm. I presume you're starting to see the currency go the other way. Is that going to inhibit your ability to re-price for the currency mess of the last few years, or not at all?","Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.","That's not going to inhibit it. Inflation's still high there so we have to cover inflation. And, in fact, we need price and productivity to combat inflation down there. So we're going to have to price to the inflationary market that still exists. I know it's strange to talk about 8% or 9% inflation when the rest of the world is seeing deflation, but that's just the facts of what's taking place there.","And we don't talk about this a lot, but we do have competitors there that are struggling. So that doesn't make some of our price objectives that easy to attain sometimes. But we have an organization there that certainly understands that pricing is important and they know how to get it and they know how to manage it on a very granular and tactical level. And they've done a great job and I expect them to continue to do a great job.","Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Don Carson of Susquehanna.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you. Steve, a question on healthcare. In one of your slides, slide five, you talk about that being one of your resilient end markets. It looked for a while that you might be back in U.S. home healthcare, yet that's a market you exited many years ago due to Medicare reimbursement issues. So I'm just wondering, what's changed? What makes that market more attractive to you now?","Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.","Well, as we look around the world, hospital gases has always been attractive to us. And that's unchanged from what we've talked about historically. The hospital business really depends on the local market. Some markets have favorable conditions to participate in the home care market. Others do not. So we look at that very carefully. But hospital universally has been a good business.","And I said I wasn't going to comment further on Linde and I think that was what that question was alluding to. But I've been out of the U.S. home care market for a while. I think we exited in 2010, something like that. And I know that they've been through many, many rounds of auctions, competitive bidding. And that has driven the pricing down considerably. But I also understand that that's probably run its course. And so if you're ever going to participate in the U.S. home care market, now would be a much better time to start entertaining those thoughts than, say, five years ago before the onslaught started in terms of competitive bidding.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","And then a follow up on U.S. merchant. I assume that your merchant operating rates are still through the high 70%s, low 80%s. And it's been that way for, I guess, for the last five, six years. Is there any way to rationalize your U.S. merchant capacity, or is that really precluded by logistical arrangements?","Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.","That's something we look at all the time in terms of based on end market demand trends, should we be running this plant harder, should we idle this plant. So that's something we look at on an ongoing basis.","You are correct in terms of where the capacity utilizations reside. I think we touched 80% in the U.S. this quarter. And we're talking about LOX\/LIN, so obviously it really depends on which product you're talking about. LOX\/LIN are the two largest products. Argon is certainly a higher capacity utilization than that. And if we look around the world, the answer is probably 70%s no matter what country you look at from a capacity utilization standpoint.","So there is capacity there to serve growth as it materializes. And in the U.S., I wouldn't say there's a lot that we can do to rationalize capacity. We already have swap agreements, product swap agreements, with our competitors. They've been in place for a long time. It's something we continue to look at. But I would say, in the U.S., we're pretty sophisticated in terms of going through that analysis.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer of Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Good morning. A question back on the CO2 business. So two really. One, if you look out three to five years from now, from 10% today, how big could that business be in your relative portfolio?","And then what are the real synergies as you build new business in other geographies? Is it a localized business, like the rest of industrial gases? Or are there some real synergies between owning stuff in the U.S. and Europe, Latin America and Asia?","Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.","I would say it is very much a localized business. It is very dependent on getting high quality sources and keeping them under contract. And if you're not able to do that, you're really not able to make a go at the CO2 business. So that's something we work very hard to do.","I would say the synergies would come more from just as you have more and more CO2 businesses you run around the world, more and more operations, more distribution, you just get better at how to run those plants. You get better at distribution. And so that would be more so the synergy, I would say, from an operating efficiency standpoint.","And then from a growth standpoint I do believe that this has a lot of legs in terms of mid to high-single digit growth going forward. So I don't know what the math is going be, but it will increase from 10% of our sales today to something higher going forward.","And the announcement that we made MEGlobal, where, as Matt discussed, we're supplying oxygen and nitrogen to their greenfield ethylene glycol plant, we're also taking CO2 off of that plant, some 450 tons per day. And we're going to build a CO2 plant and we're going to serve that local market. So that's three years out before that plant will start up. And so we have strong growth expectations for CO2 for some time to come.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then another area, a little bit smaller for you guys, political relations with Russia in the U.S., deteriorating quite a lot. Has that impacted your business there at all in the last couple months?","Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.","It has not because we stay below the radar screen. We don't supply Gazprom or some of those large companies that are natural resource kinds of companies that are very closely aligned to the Kremlin. So we're one level or one step removed from that. We're just an oxygen supplier to NTMK, EVRAZ and so I think it hasn't affected us, nor do we expect it to affect us.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Terrific. Thank you, guys.","Operator","We have time for one more question.","Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.","Yes, one more question.","Operator","Thank you. And that question is from P.J. Juvekar of Citi.","Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.","P.J.?","Operator","P.J., your line is open.","Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.","He's not there.","Operator","P.J., your line is open. All right. Our final question will come from Steve Byrne of BOA Merrill Lynch.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thank you. Thank you, P.J., for being on mute there. I did have a follow up on this MEGlobal plant that you're building, or that you're collaborating with. Matt, you indicated your ability to get that project had to do with your pipeline reliability, but yet you're building an ASU for that project.","Can you just comment a little bit about that? Is it that being tied into your pipeline, does that enable you to build perhaps a smaller than necessary ASU? Or is it that the ASU has the backup from the pipeline and you can then have greater capacity in the pipeline? What do you see as the primary synergy here with the tie-in to the pipeline?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Yeah, I think, Steve, when you look at a customer, and it could be MEGlobal or any very large pet chem or process chemical company, reliability is paramount. These operations run 24\/7 and they're making these investments based on long-term view of their ability to produce their product and supply their product and get the return on those investments they're making. So it's absolutely critical that all suppliers, especially industrial gas suppliers, are able to keep them running and on stream. And so when they seek various bidders for their projects, they want to understand how you can ensure reliability to meet availability of 98%, 99%-plus on a 365-day basis.","So having a pipeline complex, having the ability to store product, make product, buy product and channel it through a very large network of pipes really helps improve that reliability. So if one unit goes down, you have 30 other units that you can put into the system to help back it up. So, yes, this asset will be interconnected, which gives a very strong reliability. And then obviously it gives us some cost opportunities and efficiencies we can do along our whole system as well with that density.","So this really plays into the density, and particularly on an onsite basis. But reliability and total cost of solution are the two most important things for somewhat of this type of nature. And that's what we were able to provide.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Then just the other side of this project with MEGlobal is the CO2 offtake. How do you influence the reliability of that stream and, perhaps more importantly, the plant design to maximize the concentration of that effluent stream?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Yeah, so we've been in the CO2 business since our inception, so we know how to take offtake crude CO2 in various offtake forms. This one happens to be a particularly cleaner one and more reliable based on the type of asset it's coming from. But this is something we do. We build, own and operate these plants ourselves. So no worry on that front.","And as Steve mentioned, we have an existing large business and footprint and distribution network in CO2 already. So this adds to that ability to have strategic sources in the right locations to keep growing that business in these more resilient markets. So from that perspective, no concerns whatsoever. This is something that we do on an ongoing basis.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Stephen F.

My name is Steph, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Kelcey Hoyt, Director, Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Kelcey E. Hoyt","Thanks, Steph. Good morning, and thank you for attending our third quarter earnings call and webcast. I'm joined this morning by Jim Sawyer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Liz Hirsch, our Vice President and Controller.","Today's presentation materials are available on our website at praxair.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slide and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference.","Please also note that our discussion of earnings for the third quarter, including year-over-year and sequential comparison exclude $0.04 of net earnings per share related to an income tax benefit, partially offset by a pension settlement charge and cost-reduction charges, primarily related to severance and business restructurings in Europe within both the industrial GAAP and Surface Technologies businesses. The tax benefit and charges are detailed and reconciled to the GAAP reported numbers in the appendices to this presentation and the press release.","Jim and I will now review Praxair's third quarter results and outlook. We'll then be available to answer questions.","James S. Sawyer","Thank you, Chelsea [sic] (Kelcey), and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 3 for our consolidated third quarter results. Praxair delivered strong results in third quarter despite significant currency headwinds and moderating economic conditions. While year-over-year reported sales declined by about 4%, we're able to maintain relatively even operating profit and earnings per share. The impact of currency on sales was 7%, plus another 1% from lower cost pass-through of natural gas to the selling price of hydrogen. Excluding foreign currency and cost pass-through, sales would have been up 4% and operating profit and EPS up 7%. This demonstrates that we're still able to get leverage down the income statement from improving productivity and strong cash flow and return on capital.","Operating cash flow was a record $746 million, representing about 27% of sales, and capital spending against our project backlog totaled $547 million. Our debt-to-capital ratio for the quarter was 51.6% and debt to EBITDA was 1.9x.","During the quarter, we paid dividends of $164 million and repurchased stock of $106 million, net of issuances. $1.2 million -- billion still remains available under the share repurchase program authorized in January of this year. After-tax return on capital is 14.2% and reflects the large amount of projects under construction and therefore, a significant amount of project capital on our balance sheet that is not yet completed. Return on equity was 29.2%.","And now I'll let Kelcey explain in more detail our third quarter results by segment.","Kelcey E. Hoyt","Thanks, Jim. Please turn to Page 4 for our results in North America. Sales in North America were $1.4 billion, 2% below the prior year quarter. The effects of cost pass-through, primarily lower-cost natural gas, which is contractually passed on to hydrogen customers, reduced sales by 4%. Negative currency translation, driven by the devaluation of the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, reduced sales by 2%. Sales grew 4% from higher pricing and acquisitions of packaged gas distributors. Underlying energy market sales in North America grew 6% year-over-year. This was driven by our on-site supply systems to refineries, the majority of which are on the Gulf Coast region of the United States. In addition, our oil-well service business in Mexico continued to run at very high levels and delivered solid volume growth in Mexico, providing liquid nitrogen and pressure pumping services to the oil and gas sector.","Sequential energy market sales grew 4%, with the typical third quarter seasonal pickup in our supply of liquid nitrogen, for frac-ing for natural gas liquids and oil in the Alberta region of Canada due to improved weather and road conditions. Underlying sales growth to metals customers was solid at 5% year-over-year. This was due to continued steady liquid argon sales for stainless steel and metal fabrication, as well as oxygen sales on our pipelines in the Northern United States to steel mills.","Regarding chemicals, the fundamentals for North American production remain advantaged or plentiful  across natural gases and feedstock. During the third quarter, we did experience some lower volumes due to scheduled customer maintenance, and the environment remains cautious in light of the slowing global economic growth. Underlying manufacturing sales grew 7% year-over-year with growth in all 3 countries: United States, Canada and Mexico.","Packaged gas sales remained healthy, in line with manufacturing strength. And Praxair distribution, our Canadian and U.S. packaged gas business, same-store sales, which excludes currency and acquisitions, were 5% above the last year. Gases were up 5% and hard goods were up 6%. Packaged gas primarily serves the manufacturing market, but sales were also strong year-over-year to metal fabrication, automotive and energy in support of customer activity in the Bakken and Eagle Ford region. Sequentially, sales modestly declined as growth began to moderate to metal fabrication and manufacturing.","The pipeline of activity for potential further gas -- further packaged gas acquisitions remained strong. Year-to-date, we've closed 4 acquisitions in Texas, California and New York, as well as formed a joint venture with one of our long-term distributors, nexAir, in the Southeast United States.","North American operating profit was $374 million, 10% above the prior year quarter. Excluding the negative impact of currency translations, operating profit would have grown 12% from the prior year quarter. The operating margin was 26.9%, reflecting higher pricing and productivity, which more than offset cost increases. In addition, lower cost pass-through, which reduced sales with minimal impact on operating profit, contributed 1% to the operating margin percentage for the quarter versus prior year.","44% of our large project backlog with long-term contracts is in North America. We are constructing 12 projects with customers across the United States, Canada and Mexico for energy, chemicals, metals and manufacturing industries. In 2013, we are on track to start the 2 large hydrogen projects under construction for Valero at St. Charles and Port Arthur, and the hydrogen pipeline expansion to serve Motiva and Louisiana. In addition, 2013 customer plant start-ups will include oxygen supply in the Southeast United States, as well as 2 plants in Canada. 2014 includes a plant start-up for Deacero in Mexico. Calsite [ph] activity for new on-site plants in North America is increasing, and we are seeing activity in energy, chemicals, manufacturing and metals markets.","Now please to turn to Page 5 for our results in Europe. Sales in Europe decreased 2% for the third quarter versus 2011. The weaker euro reduced sales by 13%. The sales increase from acquisition is due to an increased ownership interest in Europe Praxair located in Scandinavia, which we consolidated in the fourth quarter of 2011. Underlying sales were down 1% versus the prior year, as 2% lower volumes offset the higher pricing attained across all of our operating countries. Volumes in Spain and Italy were below the prior year quarter, primarily attributable to merchant and packaged gases. Germany experienced modestly decreased volumes as customer demand has weakened due to lower industrial economic activity.","Sequentially, volumes declined 4% versus the second quarter, with a typical summer holiday seasonality extending into continued lower levels of demand. Operating profit of $60 million was 12% below the prior year. Excluding acquisitions and currency, underlying operating profit decreased 7%, primarily driven by lower sales volume, partially offset by improved pricing.","During the quarter, we took further action to rightsize the cost structure of our European business to reflect expected longer-term slower growth in the region, especially Southern Europe. $36 million of our $56 million cost reduction charge related to the Europe segment for employee severance costs and business restructuring actions, including consolidation of packaged gas filling stations. We are expecting about a 2.5 to 3-year payback.","Page 6 shows our results in South America. South American segment sales were $560 million, down 15% from the prior year quarter. Underlying sales grew 1% for the quarter, primarily due to higher pricing, partially offset by lower volumes. Negative currency impacts, primarily the weakening of the Brazilian reais against the U.S. dollar, reduced sales by 17% in the quarter. Higher volumes from new on-site production facilities were more than offset by lower volumes to merchant and packaged gas customers, largely attributable to the weaker industrial production in Brazil. Year-over-year sales increased to metals and health care customers and were lower to manufacturing and chemicals customers.","Sequentially, underlying sales were up 2% for the quarter, driven by higher pricing with steady volumes. Negative currency impact reduced sales by 3% in the third quarter versus the second. About 20% of Praxair sales in South America come from countries outside of Brazil, including Colombia, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Venezuela, Paraguay, Bolivia and Uruguay. Underlying sales in these countries grew 11% versus the prior year quarter and 6% sequentially with growth in chemicals, food and beverage, health care and manufacturing.","Operating profit in South America was $112 million, 20% below the prior year quarter, primarily due to negative currency translation impact of 18%. X currency, operating profit was down 2% compared to the prior year as higher pricing was more than offset by the impact of a lower mix of higher-margin packaged gas and merchant liquid volumes.","The third quarter of this year was Brazil's fourth consecutive quarter of negative industrial production year-over-year, although the sequential industrial production numbers are beginning to show some slight improvement. Current Brazil Central Bank consensus industrial production for the full year 2012 remains negative. 2013 consensus industrial production is currently about 4%.","The government continues to exercise stimulus levers increase demand, including decreasing the interest rate again in October to a record low of 7.25%, which now results in a record low real interest rate as well of about 2%. In addition, the Brazilian government recently announced the reduction in taxes on power to benefit both consumers and businesses that will go into effect beginning in 2013. We continue to remain very positive on Brazil in the medium to long term, given the strong growth fundamentals in place as it continues to transition from an export-driven economy to a more local consumption-driven market with a growing middle class. In addition, there should be quite a bit of pent-up demand for infrastructure buildout in front of the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics.","We continue to see strong new project proposal activity. This demonstrates the confidence of local businesses in the longer-term growth. Proposal activity is broad based across South America and Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Argentina and Chile, primarily in energy, manufacturing and metals. South America currently has 7 projects in the backlog across 4 countries, which include Brazil, Peru, Argentina and Uruguay and diverse industries such as metals, chemicals and manufacturing. These projects are scheduled to start up during 2013 and 2014.","Now please turn to Slide 7 for our results in Asia.  Sales of $358 million grew 3% versus the prior year quarter. Volume growth of 5% came primarily from higher on-site sales in China and Korea, including new plant start-ups for metals and chemicals customers in China. Overall growth was mitigated by lower demand from the electronics end market, including semiconductor, flat-panel display and solar customers. Lower merchant and packaged gas pricing, primarily due to the electronics end market, reduced sales by 1% from the prior year quarter. We expect this challenging price environment to continue in the near term.","Electronics demand remains weaker than expected. Approximately 25% of our electronic market sales are to the semiconductor industry. Semiconductor sales continue to experience negative year-over-year growth during the third quarter and were flat sequentially due to the sluggish PC market. The solar industry continues to struggle with overcapacity, and China has about 50% of the global manufacturing capacity. Polysilicon and wafer prices continue to decline.","Negative currency impact, primarily the weakening of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar, reduced sales by 4% in the quarter. Cost pass-through increased sales by 3% during the quarter, primarily driven by higher India power pass-through and on-site sales. Asia's operating profit of $52 million declined 6% from the prior year quarter, excluding the impact of negative currency translations. Lower price decreased operating profit by about 3%, primarily for argon and silane pricings.","In addition, we experienced seasonally higher power cost in Korea. The rates reset at an increase each year in the third quarter, and cost recovery is typically delayed. And in Thailand, our food freezing business margin was impacted by low shrimp yields due to a shrimp disease, causing a decline in higher-margin merchant CO2 volumes they use for freezing. During the quarter, we signed a long-term contract with Oxiranchem to construct and operate an air separation plant with a capacity of 500 tons per day of oxygen to supply to their chemical facility located just north of Shanghai. The plant is scheduled to start up in 2014 and will also supply oxygen and nitrogen to the Yangzhou Chemical Industry Park.","Our backlog of projects in Asia is continuing to grow with 17 projects in China, India, Korea and the Middle East that will start up between the fourth quarter of this year and into 2015. New project activity for the region remains strong. We have not seen any weakening in the negotiation and bidding process for new project activity. The growth continues to be driven by longer-term secular growth needs. This includes China's policy for more energy independence and the utilization of abundant coal supply for gasification as a feedstock for the chemical industry. We build, own and operate worldscale oxygen plants for use in the gasification process.","Also, China is focused on spreading the wealth to the central and western part of China, not just on the East Coast. And we have a large project under construction in Chongqing in the center of China, which is going to be a strong growth for us when it starts up in 2014. And with emerging economies in general, the per capita consumption of industrial gases is only a small percent of what it is in United States and Europe, which as they develop over time, will utilize more and more industrial gases.","Our results for Surface Technologies are shown on Page 8. Surface Technologies sales for the quarter were $157 million, up 2% compared to the prior year, excluding currency. The underlying sales growth came from increased aerospace coatings and increased coatings for energy markets, particularly coatings for parts used in the oil and gas market. Operating profit was $25 million for the quarter. Higher volumes and leverage from improved pricing increased operating profit. These benefits were more than offset in the quarter by negative currency translation impacts of 8%.","During the quarter, we took action to consolidate and rationalize certain operations and product lines, primarily in Germany and Italy, in the weak industrial coatings sector. $16 million of our $56 million cost reduction charge related to the Surface Technologies segment. We are expecting about a 2-year payback.","And now I'll turn the call back to Jim, who will discuss our outlook and updated earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of 2012.","James S. Sawyer","Thanks, Kelcey. Please turn to Slide 9 for our updated outlook. North America, again, led the way with operating profit up 10% in light of a 2% currency headwind from Canada and Mexico. Year-to-date business conditions have been much stronger than the rest of the world, although we have seen the strong ramp-up in 2011 and the first half of 2012 moderate during the third quarter. Meanwhile, we've seen no improvement in Europe or South America. The slowdown in China is not only hurting our results in Asia but also South America, as exports of raw materials to Asia has slowed. In the near term, producers and consumers along supply chains are becoming more cautious in reducing inventories. We expect there will be more inventory correction in the fourth quarter and are anticipating extended holiday shutdowns.  Hence, we decided to reduce our earnings outlook for the fourth quarter to $1.35 to $1.40 of fully diluted EPS. In order to continue to rightsize our organization, we undertook modest restructuring in Brazil in the first and second quarters and further restructuring actions in our European industrial gases and Surface Technologies businesses during the first quarter.","Our long-term outlook remains positive. We estimate our capital spending forecast for 2012 to be about $2.2 billion against the current backlog of $2.6 billion of projects under construction with committed customer contracts. As each projects start up over the next 2 to 3 years, they'll contribute to sales and earnings growth. Over the long term, we expect to get around 4% to 6% top line sales growth from the contribution in new projects.","In addition, we had new merchant and packaged gas business, with organic growth driven by a strong pipeline of new application technologies, as well as the migration of existing application technologies globally.","We do expect the future global economic growth will be slower but that our secular growth drivers in energy, environment and emerging markets still have long legs. We believe our strategy of focusing on our core business and execution capabilities will continue to drive strong margins, cash flow and return on capital. And as you can see from our history of annual dividend increases and share repurchases, we're focused on delivering those results to our shareholders.","With that, I'd like to turn this call over to Q&A. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Jim, so your North American volume growth this year in the first 3 quarters sort of declined or decelerated from 7% growth to 4% to 0%, and last time that happened was in 2008. So what are you seeing? Are you seeing that other regions are dragging down U.S. growth? And was this -- your on-site seemed okay, so was it mostly from merchant that dragged down the growth?","James S. Sawyer","Right. I think that in 2011, really, end of 2010, 2011, in the first half of 2012, North America really climbed out of the recession and we finally got our base business, same-store sales and packaged gases back to pre-2008 levels. As we move into the third quarter, the sequential growth was limited. We had some turnarounds and so forth. So our minus 1% Q3 versus Q2 really is not meaningful of anything. But we're definitely seeing the ramp-up that we saw over the last 1.5 years slowing down. And I think that's tied to consumers. If you look at Caterpillars' results, they mentioned that dealers of farm equipment are reducing inventories. I think that's the kind of thing that you're seeing across the board. Now I don't think it's at all like 2008. I think it's just a rather a 6-month period of caution in the third and fourth quarters as we wait to see who gets elected and what happens to the fiscal cliff, but there's been some deferral in people making decisions to build things. And that's kind of flattened out the growth in the packaged and merchant business.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And just secondly, have you seen any project delays or slowdown like what some of your competitors are seeing?","James S. Sawyer","No. I guess I would say this. The projects that we have in our backlog and under construction, there is no change in the status of those projects. They've got contractual commitment. The customers are going ahead in completing the facilities that we're going to be supplying. And we have language in those contracts. We're within a certain period of time; we start up the plant and they start paying us. So the stuff in the backlog is unchanged aside from a few that we started up in the quarter and a few that we added to the backlog. Now in the category that I call projects under proposal or negotiation, that continues to be very strong. We have not seen customers who had been talking about projects and looking for proposals. We have not seen them defer the projects that they're on. So that takes a long time for people to make decisions. We may yet see some deferral, but we haven't yet. And I think that's largely because most of the projects that we're negotiating and building right now are really projects that are required by the customer for more secular reasons rather than economic reasons. So for example, we started up our last fuel project in China in July, and there's really virtually no steel in the backlog. So they just slowed down and steel consumption is really not going to affect the backlog all that much or the active projects either.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Duffy Fisher with Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","You've talked about the bidding for the projects under proposal still being strong. Are you still seeing the same kind of discipline in the pricing that competitors would be giving for those projects, or have you seen some of the slowness in the economy start to affect maybe the returns that some competitors might take?","James S. Sawyer","By and large, I think that what happens in the on-site business is that you make a contract with a customer and you live with that return for 15 years or 20 years. And so there's no reason to go in and try to take a loss leader and think you'll make it back later on. So I think that's the way we look at the projects. We haven't seen any real change in the marketplace in terms of competitive dynamics. It's a very competitive industry, but we really haven't seen a change. And the returns on capital, the projects that we're signing are basically as good or as high as the ones that we've signed in the past. Having said that, I'll say that the smaller projects tend to -- we're in a very niche position, and tend to have the highest returns, and the larger stand-alone projects tend to have returns in the low to mid-teens.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then again given kind of the projects under proposal, $2.6 billion in backlog, is it fair to assume that it's still a decent bet that CapEx is up next year versus this year?","James S. Sawyer","We haven't given guidance for CapEx next year. We'll be spending close to $2.2 billion this year in the quarter just ended with the highest CapEx we've had. I don't expect it to go up next year. I expect it to probably go down a little bit, but we're in heavy spending right now on 3 steam methane reformers. We're in the heavy spending part of that cycle, and they're going to start up in the first half of 2013.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Edward Yang with Oppenheimer.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","On the FX side, are you doing any currency hedging at this point?","James S. Sawyer","Not much of anything right now.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And on packaged gases, did you provide a breakdown between price versus volume or rent versus hard goods?","James S. Sawyer","I think both the gas volumes and hard goods were up roughly 5% or 6%. And so that -- what you're seeing there is that as we came out of the recession, the hard goods growth was much faster than the gas growth. And that was -- when you go back into a recession, the hard goods goes lower because people stop buying welding equipment. So now that we're in kind of an equilibrium with both growing the same amount, within that 5%, roughly half price and half volume.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And in Europe, Europe is down to about 13% of revenues, and it's only about 10% of your operating profit at this point. Given that you might be thinking that this might be a long slog there, are you seeing additional opportunities for more substantial restructuring there other than the rightsizing actions that you've taken, such as asset swaps or divestitures, selective actions there?","James S. Sawyer","We're not planning on any divestiture or swaps or any type of transactions like that in Europe. And certainly something could come down the road, but we're not planning anything like that. And basically, in the 2008 recession, we did a fair amount of cost cutting, but one of the rules that we had was that we weren't going to take out any capacity, so that we would still have that capacity when volume came back. We've now come to conclusion in Europe that some of the demand is never going to come back. And that is specifically in Spain and Italy in the packaged gas business where I think construction in Spain was driven rough -- very rapidly by the lowering interest rates when they got into the eurozone, subsidies from the European Union and a number of other things that basically drove construction, which aren't there anymore. So we've included that. We have too much capacity in packaged gases, and we're rationalizing some fill stations, and so that's all we can do right now without cutting into volume and so forth.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Peter Cozzone with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Peter J. Cozzone - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","In regards to your long-term growth targets, can you just tell us how you feel about those targets now that maybe the macro environment might be a bit more sluggish than expected when you last laid those out?","James S. Sawyer","I think that there are parts of our growth that we have control over, which is basically applications technology and the projects. I think they are pretty well still intact. Now we've always said that some of the growth will come from just general increases in industrial production globally. I agree with what you're saying. I think that for the next 10 years, industrial production will be slower than it was for the last 10.  Who knows? But -- so that will probably temper some of the growth there, but we're not going to wait for a rising tide to hit our earnings goals, so we'll continue to focus on productivity and pricing and restructure bit by bit as we have to.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Great. And then one follow-up on the PDI business, can you give us some color on the recent trends as far as maybe how those progress throughout the quarter and your expectations here given the more uncertain macro environment?","James S. Sawyer","Yes, I'm guessing that we'll have relatively flattish volumes sequentially going from the second to the third quarter, also from the third and fourth quarter. And that's just coming over the top, I guess, because I do think that as we get into the holiday season, it's always difficult to predict. But in times when there's a little bit of excess capacity and not enough demand, people tend to take longer shutdowns at year end. Now in times when it's the reverse thing, they work right through just the holiday season, but I'm just expecting this quarter that we're going to have more people rationalizing.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Jim, just trying to think of what kind of earnings tailwind you'll get next year from all these new projects, even with sluggish IP these new projects contributed a lot. I know you used to be more precise in terms of EPS contribution.  Can you give us some help on that front?","James S. Sawyer","For 2013, I mean we haven't really come out with any guidance there. In fact, next week, we've got our folks in from around the world to put together our overall plan for next year. So we don't have any kind of bottoms-up look at that. But I would say that we're going to expect North America to continue to lead the way. We're going to continue to get pretty significant growth from project start-ups in North America. And then we really need to get Europe and South America out of the tank, but some of that is going to depend on what happens with the quarter slowdowns there. But generally speaking, I think I will -- I would like to give you some guidance that we'll have sales growth in the 5% to 10% range without acquisitions, leading more with some acquisitions, and we're getting earnings growth in the double-digit area again.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And I know in the past you talked maybe about 5 percentage points of growth just with the new projects alone.  Is that still a relevant number or is there sort of a pickup next year with some of this new SMRs in North America?","Kelcey E. Hoyt","We typically get about 4% to 6%.","James S. Sawyer","Yes, we still get 4% to 6%. We'll get probably more than that next year but -- because we've got a lot of projects starting up, because it's usually about a 3-year gestation period on these projects. And the projects that would have been signed in 2009 would be starting up in 2012. But because of the recession, there was a big lull in project signings, and now we're experiencing the lull in start-ups, but we've got a lot more starting up next year.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And then just one follow-up. Some of your competitors have talked about heightened level of competitive activity in the U.S. liquid market. Are you seeing any evidence of that? And just as -- did you mention what your Lin\/Lox operating rate was in the U.S.?","James S. Sawyer","I think the emerging market is fine. We're doing very well in the merchant market. When you got liquid oxygen, liquid nitrogen; you've also got argon and helium and liquid hydrogen in there. And to some extent, you also have the gases used for frac-ing, liquid nitrogen and liquid CO2. And so sometimes depending on the frac-ing and the weather, you'll see kind of spikes up that come in the merchant side. I think we've all seen a decline in liquid hydrogen, partially attributable to the end of the space shelf, okay? So there are things like that, that are going on. And but I think that overall, we'll continue to see merchant demand growth grow faster than industrial production.","Kelcey E. Hoyt","And Don, the operating rate spend in the low-80s is pretty consistent with what we've seen most of this year.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a couple of questions on Brazil. You referenced sort of a 4% consensus industrial production number for 2013.  Is that consistent with -- when you talk to your customers, or are they sort of expecting something along those lines?","James S. Sawyer","No, no. I think that it's been negative this year. I think that when it turns around, you'll usually see a fair amount of volatility in Brazil. When things slow down, they speed up quickly and there's a big growth. So I could see a number bigger than that if the economy starts to turn around. So I think that's a -- we're in pretty good shape there. The one thing that I think is on my mind is to what extent the slowdown in Chinese demand impacts the rest of the world. And China is Brazil's largest trading partner. So I do think we're experiencing a situation where turnaround would have already started to begin, but it's being delayed by increasing demand from China. And so that's all got to be part of the equation of what happens next year.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And just as a follow-up to that, if we work backwards from the Olympics and the World Cup and the idea that, that will stimulate some infrastructure demand, what is sort of the deadline where that needs to start showing up in order for it be there for those events?","James S. Sawyer","Well, they should be working on that stuff and building things now. And Petrobras is also a big driver of construction. They've got so much spending going on, but what's slowed down is manufacturing and what's slowed down is some of the export business. So it's hard to say, but I think you'll see some pickup from those things, but you're also going to see hopefully some pickup in consumer spending and auto and truck production and so forth.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of David Manthey with Robert W. Baird.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","First off, with your comments, Jim, about the growth potentially being slower going forward, you mentioned a few other things you would focus on. But how confident are you longer term or medium term that you'll be able to get operating leverage at those lower levels of growth?","James S. Sawyer","Well, I think what -- you just have to look at our segment results coming out of the recession to see that when we're in the recession, our North America margins were around 20%, maybe 18%, 19%. And that's because, particularly in the merchant and packaged business, you don't have a lot of customers go away, but you had a lot of customers taking less demand, which means that you've had less revenue per delivery or product, if you will. As that demand turns back, we got a lot of operating leverage in North America. Now what we're seeing in South America and Europe is exactly where we're in North America in 2008, where volume was off and we've got -- we've been going through negative operating leverage as volume had declined. So if volume keeps declining more, we'll have to take some more cost out. But I do think that in both Europe and South America that construction in metal fab and machinery and repair activity is probably below equilibrium and will come back to some extent. So what we want to see is our margins go up there. And I think we'll get some operating leverage out of that.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And so relative to your longer-term organic growth targets through 2015 of 8% to 12%, if that comes in, do you still feel confident that the 10% to 15% operating profit and the 12% to 18% EPS is doable between now and then, assuming we're in a normal kind of slow growth economy, not recession?","James S. Sawyer","I think it's July. I do think that we're going to be in the lower end rather than higher end just as long as you don't get much help from the economy.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Jim, on the backlog with the 3 SMRs starting up next year, is it elective that the backlog will be down a year from now from what you see in the bid activity?","James S. Sawyer","Well, it's certainly possible because, as I said before, we've got a lot of project starting up in the next 12 months. And as they start up, they come out in the backlog. So it will be going down unless we sign a lot of new contracts, but I'm pretty confident that the ones that we're negotiating right now, we will win most of. And that over the long run, we'll be able to keep the backlog in the area of $2 billion to $2.5 billion, which is what we need to support 4% to 6% sales growth.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And lastly, do you have early read on pension expense for next year versus this year?","James S. Sawyer","Yes. Our pension expense for next year probably will be about $20 million or $0.05 a share higher than this year.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Jim, I don't think you mentioned the same restraints on helium.  Have you got your BLM supply figured out there? And are you back to normal or are you still in allocation and has that offered you some up between the takes and market share?","James S. Sawyer","No, we're not on allocation. We had a couple of temporary allocations because of the facilities being down. But we've still got a strong supply from the BLM and from the other sources that we supply from. And I think we're the only producer of helium that's not going to be on allocation right now.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then you mentioned earlier maybe the next decade looks a little bit different from capital investment in some of the end markets where your customers operate. How would you expect that to manifest through your strategies? If you just spend a few more CapEx dollars and maybe a little more return of capital to shareholders? Do you change the country focus? Have you sort of come to grips with any big picture issues, or is this just a standard issue of macroeconomic and cyclical speed bump here?","James S. Sawyer","You know me, Bob. I'm always on the pessimistic side. But I just think that we've got budget balances and so forth to deal with. I do think that North America economy in the industrial side will be strong. We're seeing an uptick in projects right now, primarily related to the chemical industry. There are about 15 proposed chemical facilities, which either need oxygen or nitrogen or CO2. So we're looking at a lot of proposal activity going on in North America. So I think that that will be the main driver. I think that we've got a lot of projects going on in South America, both inside of Brazil and outside of Brazil, a lot of projects in Colombia and Peru and Argentina and so forth, and I think that will be strong. Russia, we probably got more project on our -- that we can manage right now. So we're quickly addressing that. But I think that projects outlook will continue to be strong, and I don't think that we'll need to reduce our expectations for our capital spending.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You often talk about new projects adding something like 4% to 6% to revenue growth. But if I look at your first 3 quarters, I think your volumes are up about 2%. So is it the case that really fewer projects came on to affect revenues this year, or is it that they came on but that the underlying industrial gas business across the globe is down a couple of percent.  That is, why isn't the underlying volume growth stronger for the amount of new projects that you have coming on?","James S. Sawyer","Well, I guess the first reason is that, while we did start up a few projects this year, we haven't started up that many. As I mentioned earlier, 2012 is a lull year for start-ups because just 2009 was a lull year for signings. Now the -- well we have started the projects up and we're getting the volume and the revenue from them, but our base business volumes in packaging and merchant in Europe are significantly down year-over-year and the same thing in South America. And pricing is down in China. So that's really kind of offset the contribution from the new projects.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then secondly, what was the merchant gas volume growth rate in the United States in the third quarter? And was it above GDP or below GDP or above industrial production or below industrial production?","James S. Sawyer","Merchant gas volume were up some in the third quarter year-over-year, but there were some puts and takes inside of that. There was less gas use in frac-ing than the year before and that's a big volume swinger. So we still had strong argon and helium and CO2 volumes.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Jim, just wanted a follow-up on merchant gases.  If you look back over the past couple of quarters, do you believe that you've picked up any market share in North American merchant gases? If I look at your volumes, they seem to be running a bit higher than your principal competitors.  Wondering if there are any shares shifts or if it might be attributable to mix or other issues.","Stephen F. Angel","Well, I guess mathematically, if our volume is growing faster than theirs, you might come to conclusion that we must be picking up share. But I  certainly don't think we picked up any share that would have been their existing customer. It may be that we've signed new business at a faster rate. Or I can even put another spin on that, which is that it all depends on the customers who you get married to. If you get married to customers who don't grow, then you live with that. If you get married to customers who grow faster, then that's a good place to be.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. It makes sense.  I guess, just as a related follow-up, your same-store sales in packaged gases look to have run about 200 basis points or so higher than your main competitor there. Is it a similar dynamic that you've been doing in packaged gases, Jim?  Maybe you can elaborate on what's going on there?","James S. Sawyer","I can't speak for what's going on with competitors, but I think our growth rate has been in line with demand growth. And these quarters, they bounce up and down for everybody. You had one new customer and one new project or something like that and it changes a quarter, especially when you're looking at 2 percentage points over the whole volume area. So I think everybody is doing fine, and I think demand is still strong. I don't think it's just growing as fast as it was a year ago, but I think it's still strong. And you're going to start to see, I think once we get into January and February, more people start buying equipment and building things again.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of John McNulty with Credit Suisse.","Abhiram Rajendran - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is Abhi Rajendran calling in for John. A quick question on Europe.  Assuming a more moderate macro environment there in the foreseeable future, I guess, what sort of margin target can you reasonably achieve over the next couple of years, is it closer to 20% or do you think you can get into kind of a mid-20s again?","James S. Sawyer","Well, they just -- but we don't get absolutely the 20%. I think if we got some help from the economy in Europe, then we would see strong operating leverage because we've taken a lot of cost out of our operations. Just like we did in the U.S., and I talked about the U.S. before. We took a lot of cost out of 2008, and we didn't add those people back, and that's why we're getting so much operating leverage. And I think we're going to see the same thing in both Europe and South America when volumes come back.","Abhiram Rajendran - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then just a quick follow-up on the aerospace aviation market. That's been a pretty, a bright spot for you in the recent past. I guess what's your outlook for this area as it pertains to your surface coatings business?","James S. Sawyer","Surface coatings has got basically 3 end markets, one of which is aerospace, that's about 35% of the sales. I think I'm very optimistic and very positive about that. We have the contracts with the main jet makers so that when the aircraft get delivered and they actually put the engines on them, we're going to see more demand growth in the aerospace. Now unfortunately offsetting that, especially in Europe, has been our industrial consumers who are in the printing and textile and transmission parts and stuff like. It has really been slow in Europe, and that's why we're closing down a couple more plants in Europe this quarter.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Mike Harrison with First Analysis.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Just looking at the South America business, it's understandable given the weakness that you're seeing in Brazil that you would be highlighting the growth outside Brazil, but can you talk about whether there's been a concerted effort to diversify your South American business out of Brazil? And can you just remind us, what are your strongest market positions outside of Brazil?","James S. Sawyer","Well, I wouldn't say that there's been a concerted effort to kind of change our portfolio. We're kind of agnostic as to what end market we're in and what country we're in as long as we get the right kind of risk return that we're looking for. But as Brazil is going through a recession, Chile, Peru, Colombia are doing just fine, okay? And Argentina and Venezuela are probably another story. But there is a lot of demand for new projects in many of those countries. And for example, there are several projects that refiners are looking at where they don't refine enough losol -- they don't refine enough diesel to fill all the cars up. And so the countries import diesel and gasoline. So there are some refinery projects for iodin, for losol, for diesel. There are other metals projects and general manufacturing projects, in glass and ed [ph] and stuff like that. And so those economies are growing. And I think we're very well situated in them. We have strong market share. We have excellent talent. And they're not that big, but they are a good contributor of growth and high returns for us.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And then looking at the electronics market, down 3% year-on-year, but up 1% sequentially. Can you just give a little more color on what you're seeing right now in that market? How's the visibility on growth as we head into kind of a period where we would normally expect a seasonal build? Any indications on where customer inventories are, things of that nature?","James S. Sawyer","I'm not really sure. It's not one of our bigger end markets and I'm hardly the expert in it. But there's clearly been a big, big problem in China and in the polysilicon market. And that's just because people expected that thin film panels would be their way of the future and it didn't turn out to be that way. And so pricing has fallen and volumes have fallen there, and we're all getting hurt by that. The reason we had sequential gain was really our business in Korea. We're a primary supplier to Samsung there. And what they tend to do when demand goes down is they've got some fabs that are wholly owned fabs and they've got some fabs that are outsourced, and they tend to bring the work back home when they need to keep the home fabs operating.","Operator","And there are no further questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Jim Sawyer for closing remark.","James S. Sawyer","Great, Steph. Thank you all for attending the conference call.

My name is Tia, and I'll be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will conduct the question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Kelcey Hoyt, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Kelcey Hoyt","Thanks, Tia. Good morning and thank you for attending our fourth quarter earnings call and webcast. I'm joined this morning by Matt White, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Liz Hirsch, our Vice President and Controller.","Today's presentation materials are available on our Web site at praxair.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference. Please also note that our discussion of earnings for the full year and fourth quarter including year-over-year and sequential comparisons excludes fourth quarter 2014 adjustments related to the Venezuela currency devaluation, a bond redemption and pension settlement charge, as well as previously disclosed adjustments in 2013. These items are detailed and reconciled to the reported GAAP numbers in the appendices to this presentation and the press release.","Matt and I will now review Praxair's 2014 full year and fourth quarter results, as well as our outlook for 2015 including earnings guidance. We'll then be available to answer questions.","Matt White","Thanks, Kelcey and good morning, everyone. I\u2019d like to open up the call by providing a recap of 2014 and then I\u2019ll cover the 2015 outlook after Kelcey\u2019s review of our results. We performed well in 2014 despite significant challenges as our operational and capital discipline enabled us to deliver strong earnings within our original guidance range. Price attainment and cost control were achieved in all operating segments. The U.S. on-site, merchant and packaged gas businesses improved across most end-markets. Our South American team grew the underlying business mid single-digits for the year. Europe was stable and the business achieved an operating margin expansion of over 100 basis points.","In Asia, India accelerated as China decelerated. Globally, new plant start-ups and acquisitions contributed to growth. As you may recall in early 2014, our guidance outlook was based on some key assumptions including a very flat economic performance in Brazil of 3% currency headwind and low to mid single-digit growth in the rest of the world. While we tracked well to this guidance in the first half of the year, we faced several headwinds in the latter half. The last two quarters of 2014 saw a deep recession in Brazil, a significant and unexpected slowdown in the energy market in Mexico and a substantial devaluation of virtually every foreign currency.","Despite these unexpected headwinds, we grew sales and operating profit for the year at 6% and earnings per share of 9%, excluding currency. We continue to deliver solid execution and productivity combined with industry-leading return on capital and return on equity that allowed us to grow EPS even faster. We generated strong operating cash flow of $2.9 billion, which represented 23% of sales and a record free cash flow of $1.2 billion.","Full year EBITDA and operating margins grew to new highs of 32.2% and 22.4% respectively, which exemplifies the discipline and execution of the Praxair team around the world. In addition to our strong operational performance, we prudently managed our capital structure by investing $1.8 billion of capital expenditures and acquisitions toward future growth, while returning $1.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and net stock repurchases. The resiliency of our business model and stability of cash flow generation enables us to consistently return capital to shareholders, especially in times of more moderate growth. In fact, we just announced a 10% dividend increase today, which speaks to our confidence of future cash flow generation.","However, we know there is still room for improvement and we cannot standstill. We continuously adjust our business structure to be aligned with changes in macroeconomic conditions. Consequently, during the fourth quarter we executed a series of additional cost actions across most operating segments to better position us for the current growth environment. The related severance charges of about $15 million are included in the fourth quarter operating results and are expected at a payback of approximately one-year. So while 2014 ended with volatility around commodity pricing and foreign currencies, we continue to focus on the things within our control to improve upon our leadership position.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Kelcey, who\u2019ll review our 2014 results in more detail.","Kelcey Hoyt","Thanks, Matt. Please turn to Slide 3 for an overview of the full year. As Matt commented earlier, our results in 2014 were solid. Overall sales were $12.3 billion, up 6% versus the prior year ex-currency. Organic sales growth came primarily from increased volumes in the Americas and Asia, including new plant start-ups as well as higher overall pricing across all operating segments. End-market growth year-over-year was broad-based including manufacturing, metals, food and beverage, energy, chemical and healthcare. Operating profit of $2.7 billion grew 6% year-over-year excluding foreign currency from higher pricing, volume growth, productivity savings and acquisitions. In addition, we grew full year EBITDA and operating margins to record levels.","During 2014, our productivity initiatives again exceeded our targeted savings of at least 5% of our cost stack. These efforts are not an annual or quarterly event, but something that all employees are working toward on a daily basis. The constant focus on generating productivity initiatives, executing them and replicating them globally typically within the areas of production, procurement and distribution offsets inflation in our cost structure. One additional benefit is that a little more than 25% of our savings came from what we call sustainable productivity initiatives with the largest being energy efficiency improvements in our plants and distribution fleet.","Net income of $1.9 billion increased 5% from the prior year. Our key leverage metrics including the debt-to-capital ratio increased to 59.6%, primarily due to the impact of negative currency translation on the capital base, while the debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.3 times. During 2014, we issued euro denominated notes of 1.1 billion in two tranches with 6 to 11 year terms at an average of interest rate of 1.6%. We were able to take advantage of low interest rates and our tight issue spreads to treasuries. At year-end about 80% of our debt was fixed rate and about 20% was floating rate, as we have significantly reduced our exposure to rising interest rates. Our after-tax return on capital for the year was 12.7%, capital project spend and acquisitions are typically dilutive to return on capital and below the corporate average for at least the first several years. We expect return on capital to trend upward as earnings grows faster than the capital base. We maintained a healthy return on equity of 28.7%.","Please turn to Slide 4 for an overview of cash flow. Through consistent capital and operational discipline, we generated strong operating cash flow of $2.9 billion for the year which was equal to 23% of sales. 1.8 billion of CapEx projects and acquisitions was prudently invested for growth and density improvement. 1.5 billion was returned to shareholders equally in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Capital spending in 2014 was $1.7 billion with almost half of the CapEx spend occurring in North America, about 20% in South America and about 15% each in Asia and Europe. During 2015, the distribution of spend across geographies is expected to be similar with an increase in spend in the U.S. Gulf Coast offset by a decrease in Europe.","We spend at least $500 million annually on maintenance CapEx and about $100 million on cost reduction projects that typically include plant efficiency improvements. The remainder of the capital spending is for new production plants under contract with customers, as well as distribution equipment which support sales and earnings growth. In 2014, we invested $114 million in acquisitions net of divestitures. We acquired several core industrial gas tuck-in acquisitions including seven U.S. packaged gas distributors, full ownership of our U.S. Mid-Atlantic joint venture and Messer\u2019s Italian business. We continue to look selectively for acquisitions in our core gases business, which are high quality, low risk properties where we can bring synergies to the business we are buying and where we can achieve an attractive return on investment.","This morning we announced a 10% increase to our quarterly dividend in the first quarter of 2015, which represents our 22nd consecutive annual increase. This is consistent with our policy of growing dividends each year at least in line with earnings growth. During 2014, we reduced our outstanding share count by 1%. This was our 5th consecutive year of reducing the share count by at least by 1% and $1 billion remains available under the current $1.5 billion share repurchase program. We expect to continue our strong cash flow generation and our stock buyback program to reduce the share count, without diminishing our credit rating or access to low cost funding.","Please turn to Slide 5 for an overview of the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter sales were $3 billion and grew 3% over 2013 ex-currency. Organic sales increased from higher volumes and higher pricing in the Americas and Asia. Sales were higher primarily to the manufacturing, metals, food and beverage and healthcare end-markets. Sequentially underlying sales were down 2% versus the third quarter due primarily to the timing of customer turnarounds in North America, weaker volumes in Northern Europe and seasonal customer production curtailments in South America.","Operating profit was $663 million in the fourth quarter and steady with the prior year quarter excluding foreign currency. Operating profit growth was less than sales growth primarily due to the $15 million of severance charges we took during the quarter. EBITDA and operating margins remain strong at 32.3% and 22.2% respectively. Net income of $460 million was comparable to the prior year quarter. Fourth quarter earnings per share of a $1.57 grew 5% ex-currency. Fourth quarter operating cash flow of $772 million represented 26% of sales and funded $482 million of capital expenditures. The Company paid a $189 million of dividends and repurchased $282 million of stock net of issuances. Our project backlog which we define as projects with CapEx greater than $5 million and associated with the fully executed customer supply contract remained steady at $1.9 billion and is comprised of 24 projects.","During the fourth quarter we signed two long-term contracts for new projects located in Northern Europe and started three plants located in the Americas and Asia. Our backlog remains diverse with projects in North America and Asia each representing about one-third of the capital expenditures in the backlog and the rest in Europe and South America. These projects will serve customers in the chemical, metals, manufacturing, energy and electronics end-markets.","Please turn to Page 6 for our results in North America. Sales in North America were $1.6 billion 3% above the prior year quarter, excluding negative currency impact. Underlying sales growth of 2% was primarily driven by higher volumes in merchant and packaged gases, as well as higher pricing. Acquisitions contributed 1% growth primarily from U.S. packaged gases distributors. On-site volumes were modestly weaker year-over-year and sequentially primarily due to customer turnarounds. Merchant volume trends remain positive year-over-year in the United States and Canada. Liquid nitrogen sales in Mexico for our oil well services business remained significantly weaker year-over-year, but steady sequentially.","Packaged gases grew modestly in North America during the fourth quarter in U.S., Mexico and Canada. Organic sales for our U.S. packaged gas business grew 1% year-over-year and were steady sequentially ex-days. In addition acquisitions contributed 4% growth year-over-year. U.S. growth was driven by gases and rent partially offset by modest declines in hard goods primarily due to the timing of large automation equipment sales in the prior year quarter. U.S. packaged gas growth was broad-based and strongest by end-market to customers in metal fabrication, transportation and construction. Sales to healthcare services, machinery and education such as welding schools also continue to grow.","North American operating profit was $388 million, 2% above the prior year quarter excluding negative foreign currency translations. Growth came from higher volumes, higher pricing and acquisitions. Segment operating margin was 24.4%. Pricing trends remain positive. During mid-December we announced the North American merchant and packaged gas price action effective January 1, 2015 for several products and fees. Proposal activity for new industrial gas on-site plants in North America remains active for chemical customers located primarily in the U.S. Gulf Coast region, as well as smaller on-site plants for manufacturing.","Now please turn to Page 7 for our results in Europe. Sales in Europe were $356 million, 12% below the prior year quarter. Ex-currency cost pass-through and net divestitures organic sales were 1% below the prior year primarily due to weaker sales in Northern Europe. Sequentially organic sales in Spain and Italy including price remained positive while Northern Europe is weaker. Operating profit of $63 million was 9% below the prior year excluding currency, primarily driven by severance cost and lower volumes. Excluding severance cost incurred the operating margin percentage for Europe in the fourth quarter would have been in line with the prior quarters both year-over-year and sequentially.","During the quarter we signed long-term contracts to supply chemical and metals customers in Northern Europe, one in Germany and one in Antwerp via extensions of our existing pipeline networks. Product supply is expected to start in 2016. During 2015 assuming at least stable to modest volume growth including new plant start-up contribution in Russia, we expect to continue to see at least a high-teens operating margin percentage that reflects solid operating leverage with continued focus on fixed cost.","Page 8 shows our results in South America. South American segment sales were $473 million 8% above the prior year quarter ex-currency. Strong price of 4% year-over-year included recovery of high inflation in the region. South American volume growth of 4% year-over-year was about one-half from Brazil and one-half from the countries outside of Brazil. Praxair Brazil again outperformed the estimated negative 5% industrial production in the quarter, driven by growth in less cyclical end-markets such as healthcare and food and beverage. Sequentially lower volumes in on-site and packaged gas have reduced sales by 1%. During the fourth quarter as expected, customers in Brazil extended holiday shutdown periods. This occurred in most end-markets with the largest impact in manufacturing.","Operating profit in South America was $105 million up 2% over prior year ex-currency, due primarily to higher volumes and pricing. 2015 consensus industrial production for Brazil is estimated to be less than 1%. However, through continued strength of our local business team and management of what is under our control including price and productivity we expect local currency results to continue to outperform. And when economic recovery returns, we\u2019re well positioned for higher growth at strong incremental margins.","Please turn to Slide 9 for our results in Asia. Sales of $407 million grew 3% versus the prior year quarter. Volume growth of 5% was driven by new projects start-ups in India and Korea and included sale of equipment of our joint venture in China. Higher price contributed 1% sales growth and was primarily driven by helium. China had only modest base business growth during the quarter, attributable to slowing macro conditions and our continued ongoing efforts to ship merchant liquid from distributor channels to direct customers. Our efforts are supported by our application technologies that are driving growth to end-users in the areas of combustion, metal fabrication and water.","Asia\u2019s operating profit of $77 million decreased 3% from the prior year excluding currency. Operating profit grew from higher volumes, pricing and productivity gains, but was more than offset by severance cost and a prior year quarter gain of about $10 million related to a land sale in Korea. Proposal activity in Asia continues to be driven by longer-term secular needs in China and India to metals, energy and wastewater treatment end-markets.","However we\u2019re experiencing longer cycle times with customers to bring project to close. For 2015 we expect mid to high single-digit organic growth in Asia including project start-ups of new plants in China and India serving chemicals, metals and manufacturing customers. We expect to continue to protect the margins through strong cost control and productivity as well as through price attainment in India, Korea and Thailand.","Our results for surface technologies are shown on Page 10. Surface technology sales for the quarter were $165 million up 1% compared to the prior year. The underlying sales growth came primarily from higher price. Overall volumes were comparable to the prior year period and looking forward aviation-related coatings remained solid. Operating profit was $30 million as compared to $27 million in the prior year with growth attributable to higher price and productivity initiatives.","And now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Matt, who\u2019ll discuss our outlook and earnings guidance for 2015.","Matt White","Please turn to Page 11. We\u2019re issuing full year EPS guidance of $6.15 to $6.50 for 2015. Excluding currency this guidance represents 4% to 7% sales growth and 5% to 11% earnings per share growth. Included in these figures is approximately $0.05 or an incremental 1% headwind from higher pension expense versus 2014. This guidance assumes that foreign currency translation will negatively impact our full year sales by 6% and earnings by 7% or $0.44 of EPS. This is one of the largest currency moves we\u2019ve seen since the financial crisis.","You can see on Page 15 in the appendix, how each key currency has changed since the last quarter and since the start of 2014. Almost 40% of our sales have experienced 8% to 12% devaluation in foreign currencies which will create an immediate negative impact to our book earnings. However, our contract structure and investment management process have worked to protect us from these fluctuations over the longer-term.","Page 12, shows our year-over-year impact of foreign currencies for the last 16 years, and compares it to the growth of our earnings per share and operating cash flow. You can see that currencies go up and they go down, they\u2019re unpredictable. However, we continue to grow operating cash flow and our earnings despite this volatility. In fact operating cash flow has increased more than four times over this period.","We\u2019ve been able to achieve this through strong contracts, prudent investment management and ability to increase prices with inflation. Eventually, foreign currencies will rebound and become a tailwind to current book earnings, but no matter what, we will continue to focus on long-term value creation. Excluding currency translation impact, we expect to grow full year organic sales 4% to 7%, which includes volume and price.","Page 16 in the appendix provides a summary chart of our organic growth compared to a sales weighted industrial production. You can see that while IP has been in low single-digits for three years now. We have consistently grown in excess of that number. At this point we are anticipating that 2015 will be similar to the last two years. The 5% to 11% full year EPS growth assumption excluding foreign exchange is based on our proven track-record of improving operating leverage down the income statement. We expect to be able to retain price improvements and draw upon our strong productivity culture to offset the impacts of cost inflation. Furthermore, resilient free cash flow will enable us to continue to reduce our share count, which will improve earnings per share leverage.","Turning to the first quarter, our outlook is for earnings per share in the range of a $1.39 to a $1.47. Consistent with the full year outlook, the first quarter has a significant impact from foreign currency. Excluding a 7% currency headwind, this range results in a year-over-year growth rate of negative 1% to positive 4%, the bottom-end of this range represent some of the year-over-year challenges we are facing in lapping more difficult comps in Latin America. But we are actively working to improve upon this number.","In summary, we are projecting underlying trends in 2015 to be similar to 2014, but currency to be more of a headwind. Despite this we will manage the things we can control, prudently grow and improve the quality of our business. We see solid project growth opportunities in U.S. Gulf Coast and we expect to close on a major project in the next few months. And while uncertainties around emerging markets and commodity prices may delay our customers\u2019 investment decisions, we will deploy our strong cash flow and distribute more capital to shareholders while remaining well positioned for growth opportunities.","And with that, I\u2019d like to now turn the call over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Vincent Andrew with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Vincent Andrew","A quick one on pricing, obviously you are seeing it everywhere but Europe year-over-year and I guess you saw it sequentially. But as we sort of enter what otherwise might be perceived as a deflationary environment, given everything that's going on with oil, does that have any impact at all on sort of the pricing opportunity you see over the next 12 or 18 months? Is it actually just a function of the underlying utilization rates or what is sort of the give and take with those dynamics?","Matt White","Well, I think Vincent and first to your point we\u2019re seeing positive pricing around the world and I think just the quarterly euro year-over-year impact in that segment is just more related to some power surcharges that are part of the merchant business. So as power goes down, the surcharges may track down a little bit. But while we are seeing clearly oil prices drop, you're seeing higher inflation in some of the emerging market, so that still will support our strong pricing and I don\u2019t expect to see an overly negative pricing impact clearly surcharges that are power-related may go up and down as with diesel surcharges. But the underlying pricing power, we still expect to see in the 1% or 2% that we\u2019ve laid out for the year.","Vincent Andrew","Okay. And then if I could just follow-up on China, I think your slide referenced that you are still seeing modest growth there. How has that environment changed sort of for the lower oil scenario? Are you seeing some facilities that now have better input costs running harder? Are you seeing any change in sort of the outlook for the coal olefins projects and so forth? Maybe just help us understand what's going on there.","Matt White","Well, I think prior to the decline in oil, we\u2019ve been seeing a general slowing in China especially around some of the large coal-based projects already. I don\u2019t think the lower oil will help that situation especially some of the coal to chemical projects remains to be seen which ones will go forward. But I still think in China that the bigger underlying issue is in their effort around environmental improvements, corruption crackdown and just some of the oversupply frankly in certain industry, I think that is just slowing some of the infrastructure investments. So, I don\u2019t think the lower oil will help, but we haven\u2019t seen any specific projects being either delayed or cancelled because of lower oil in China at this point.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of James Sheehan with SunTrust. Please proceed.","James Sheehan","In terms of China, could you tell us what was the growth rate in volumes excluding your JV and the sale of equipment there?","Matt White","Yes, so I think that JV impact in the quarter was 1% and 2%, so that's what you would back out there to sort of get to the underlying excluding that sale of equipment probably closer to 2%.","James Sheehan","Okay. And could you also provide some more color on merchant utilization rates by region and what your outlook is for those?","Matt White","Sure. And just to clarify this will be to your point around the merchant side and not the on-site. In North America we're still around the low-80s, now argon is quite tight that's in excess of mid-90s right now, so that is the product that obviously if you can make it then you can sell right now. But we're seeing to Kelcey's comments earlier mid single-digit growth in the merchant business in North America, so I think that situation is pretty good we will probably see the utilization maybe pickup a little bit but right now we're operating in the low-80s.","And South America is mid-80s, so despite the recessionary conditions we're seeing in Brazil a lot of the merchant business in South America goes to a lot of the counter cyclical industries, so food, beverage, healthcare so we're still seeing strong volumes there. The on-site unrelated to this utilization is softer especially in the steel end and we have probably 4 to 5 steel customers that are below take or pay in Brazil today.","Europe mid probably more lower-70s right now. As Kelcey mentioned Northern Europe is starting softened especially Scandinavia more oil-based economy you will see that negative impact and we did see some slowing in the back-end towards December and I think part of that is the impact of oil in Northern Europe.","And in Asia we're mid to high-70s it's a little different in each country. India is probably lower-70s because we have brought on some new capacity recently as we're starting to ramp that up. China maybe high-70s and Korea is a little bit better low-80s we're still seeing some strength in especially electronics markets there. So that's kind of what we're seeing around the world but we definitely have capacity to expand without needing to put much more capital in the ground if we do see it.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Laurence Alexander","Could you talk a little bit about how the volatility in FX flows through to your CapEx? What degree of your CapEx budget is dollar denominated, or if the flat CapEx for the year actually reflects an increase in the number of projects you are planning on bringing on?","Matt White","Sure, so as Kelcey had mentioned a good portion of our CapEx has been in U.S. and Asia. And when you look at some of the Asian currencies like the RMB and even at least as of the six months ago the rupee they haven't devalued that significantly. But generally what you see for CapEx is the construction costs will be in the local currency and the equipment cost could be sourced could be RMB, could be euros, could be dollars it depends on things like heat exchangers, rotating equipment, where you are sourcing that from. So clearly any euro-based equipment will be lower from a U.S. dollar perceptive, but U.S. dollar and RMB equipment won't be that different but construction cost in their local jurisdictions will move right with the currency rates. So looking forward into '15 we have called about a $1.7 billion rough estimate on CapEx here. Anything that's U.S.-based and U.S. Gulf-based will be dollars but some of the other regions we should see some improvement there if these devaluations happen specifically on the construction end.","Laurence Alexander","And then can you give a little bit more detail on sort of the dynamics in Latin America? In the past when you had severe FX volatility you were able to raise price to offset. Can you just walk through what you are seeing now and what you are also seeing in terms of labor inflation, cost inflation, how that affects Latin America over the next couple of years?","Matt White","We did get some pretty good pricing here this last quarter I think about 4% in South America. So we're working to keep up with that inflation. And remember that 4% just represents the merchant and packaged portion but it's divided by the entire sales. So the real pricing actions are higher than that. But I will speak to mainly Brazil right now given it's the majority of our segment, but inflation is a concern I think subsidies will probably be rolled off here which will be healthy for the long-term but it will likely create some inflation pressure in the near-term. I think the Brazilian Central Bank is realizing this hence why they have raised the SELIC rate here again, I think it's north of 12% now. So it will be something that we're used to do down there but we do expect to see especially in the next six to nine months some inflation impact. But we do have pricing mechanisms to recover that most if not all of our contracts in there are inflation indexed and so we should be able to recover that.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed.","Duffy Fischer","A question around oil and gas and its impact in the U.S. in particular around CapEx, so you guys build pretty continually, one, what are you seeing with CapEx costs is there a chance that they\u2019ll come down? And then the big build out on the chemical front that we were expecting that you would supply some gases into, does that look like that will either be slowed or delayed somewhat with these slower energy prices?","Matt White","So I can just give you my opinion, it\u2019s hard to really gauge. But most of the projects we\u2019re seeing in the U.S. Gulf Coast are more downstream. So they are petrochemicals, there are a few refinery project interests there. So each customer will be different in how they analyze it, but this first wave which is the ethylene crackers, I haven\u2019t read or seen or heard any delays on that front. We\u2019re not really directly involved in that, it\u2019s not much of a industrial gas consumer. The second wave of some of the petrochemical, while there could be delays, but we haven\u2019t seen or heard any yet as you\u2019d probably know Duffy, I mean the big reason for the investment or at least a big portion of it was chasing the lower cost feedstock, and that still exists. So while the spreads may potentially have been impacted here based on the low cost feedstock and what it could potentially ultimately sell the product for, I think it\u2019s still in an attractive spread that they\u2019re able to achieve even at the new numbers.","And the capital has been the big headwind to your point. So people would look at the profit that they could make and they look at the escalating capital and that\u2019s been a challenge. While we haven\u2019t heard anything of it coming down, I would expect it eventually probably would, you\u2019re going to see potentially more skilled labor be freed up as there is less in the oil patch upstream. I think you\u2019ll see less of a pull on significant equipment manufacturers. So hopefully that will free up space and it will free up skilled labor which could at least put a bit of a damping effect on some of the escalating CapEx cost. But we haven\u2019t heard it or seen it yet, but it could happen.","Duffy Fischer","And then just one follow-up on U.S., what do you think LOX\/LIN capacity increases will be for the industry in North America this year?","Matt White","It\u2019s hard for me to gauge to our competitors\u2019 side but I can tell you we\u2019re growing mid single-digit in there. So that should cause us to get a little bit of an uptick, maybe a percent or two in some of our utilizations. Argon there is not much more room to improve that utilization really what you look for is more argon recovery projects and more ability to extract argon. So I think it\u2019s definitely possible you could see an uptick. Now the down side in North America is if you do see a large correction in upstream liquid that\u2019s going into fracturing or enhanced oil recovery that could impact that utilization rate. Now those molecules maybe redeployed but it would cause the utilizations to go down a bit. So I think there are factors going both ways here, so I don\u2019t expect a huge move in utilization but that is something we will continue to monitor.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed.","P.J. Juvekar","Your FX chart is quite useful the long-term question is with weaker currencies in many of these countries. How long do you think it takes to see export related growth from those countries? And do you think that will happen?","Matt White","Yes that\u2019s a good point P.J. we\u2019ve been looking into that at some point you\u2019re going to see foreign currencies start to benefit these emerging markets. Their products will become cheaper. I think my guess at this point is the immediate benefit you\u2019ll see could be countries like India that are net importers of oil. This will benefit them soon. Longer range it should help the exporting capabilities of some of the other countries. It should make them more competitive now that will probably be at the expense of some U.S. experts today. So we\u2019ll have to see how long that takes but we\u2019re well positioned in these emerging markets to capture that if they do become stronger exporters.","P.J. Juvekar","I think you have said in the past that your incremental margins are north of 30% as your loadings improve. And so we\u2019ve seen some loadings improve in North America but we haven\u2019t seen really a huge operating leverage impact on your operating income line for the last few quarters. So can you tell us what\u2019s holding that back?","Matt White","A few things, I think first if you look throughout the year we\u2019ve had the start-up of some pretty large hydrogen projects. Also through '14 we had natural gas rising, now it\u2019s dropped here in the last couple of months but when you talk over the whole year we had higher pass-through in natural gas which is going to erode margins and then we brought on a lot of hydrogen volume which on an operating margin basis it is lower as you know because it has a large pass through component but on a IRR basis it\u2019s within our normal expectation for cash returns. So that\u2019s been driving some of the challenge.","In the fourth quarter specifically we do have a certain amount of severance that is baked into this number part of the $15 million North America does have a component in it. And then another angle is Mexico, right, we had some very strong margin business in the upstream with Mexico that really fell off here around end of second quarter beginning of third quarter in '14 and has created some margin pressure in North America. Now as Kelcey mentioned it stabilized here from third quarter to fourth quarter, we do have a new budget in Pemex for 2015. And so we\u2019ve seen a little bit of improvement there, but we\u2019ll have to continue to monitor it.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed.","John Roberts","You've got a project starting up in Russia I think this year and then another one next year. How are those do you think are going to play out?","Matt White","Yes, the large one for Russia is our Evraz it's two large plants. One is running, the other one is coming on here shortly. So it's producing product and that should be fully running here in the next few months for both plants. The other one is a smaller one and that\u2019s on-track, no concerns at this point. So despite what you read about in Russia and while you are seeing stagflation, we still are able to sell product and we\u2019re still seeing demand locally.","John Roberts","And do you think the backlog at the end of 2015 will be the same, lower, or higher than at the start here of 2015?","Matt White","It\u2019s hard to say, we have projects rolling off throughout '15 as expected, the U.S. Gulf Coast project when that\u2019s executed it could be a large number that could cause a jump in it. So right now I would still view it as the number it's at today plus or minus a couple of 100 million, there will be some puts and takes, but I don\u2019t see it rising dramatically and I don\u2019t know if it fall too rapidly given what we\u2019re seeing in the Gulf Coast opportunity.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Ryan Berney","This is Ryan Berney on for Bob. Just it looks, based on your guidance, that you are guiding to flat sales at the midpoint in '15 and you've called out some repurchases to kind of help you get a little bit of EPS growth, ex the FX hit. But can you give us a little bit of a sense on what you are thinking about as far as acquisitions and if you would consider using that to accelerate the top-line next year?","Matt White","Well, we do have an assumption about 1% and our strategy has been to look at core sort of tuck-in businesses, where we can justify the acquisitions primarily on synergies rather than potential sales growth. So, we\u2019ll continue to scour the globe for those opportunities given the very strong dollar foreign acquisitions are more attractive, but they still need to be in our wheelhouse and they still need to bring the synergies and opportunities that we would expect. So, I am not seeing anything much more than the 1%, but we\u2019ll continue to look and run them through our models.","Ryan Berney","And then from -- on the EPS guidance perspective, are you using FX rates as of the end of the year or are you using those more today? What are you forecasting there?","Matt White","Generally how we do our outlook rates is, we\u2019ll take the one-year forward curve and we\u2019ll take the average over that one-year forward curve. But if you were to even look at the spot numbers that can be a rough proxy but the more technical version we use is that average rate in the one-year forward curve.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Kevin McCarthy","Would you discuss the economics of adding additional argon capacity, presumably with North American rates in the mid-90s and price increases that may become more attractive? And if so, how does it differ through recovery projects or retrofits versus perhaps adding additional ASUs?","Matt White","The economics tend to be fairly strong part of a reason is argon is tight, but part of the reason also is you're making what\u2019s call premium argon and what premium argon is, is you basically vent the oxygen to make argon. So most of the projects that we\u2019re able to do are cost savings projects it\u2019s a more efficient power use to make that argon and it could be a combination of recovering argon in your fills zones, when you fill trucks or it could be actually inside the cold box either gathering or refining extra argon molecules. So, we\u2019ll look across the whole spectrum of our production plans and we\u2019re scouring all over North America trying to find argon opportunities to both enhance cost reduction as well as meet the demand. So, they tend to be highly creative projects.","Kevin McCarthy","And as a second question, are you completely agnostic to diesel prices due to pass-throughs? Or is there perhaps any small portion that's not pass through or kind of lower floor limits on surcharges where if Brent continued to go lower you would perhaps brake through the floor and capture margin, anything along those lines?","Matt White","Yes actually it's a little bit of all of that, Kevin. We do have some floors so if it goes below that floor that would be value we\u2019d keep. We do have lags on our diesel surcharges, so we should positively benefit on that lag. And as you could imagine we're always trying to manage underlying overall price and then you have surcharge as well, so really need to step back and look at the entire equation to understand surcharges versus pricing. But for the most part we're covered but we continue to try to identify areas in that equation.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Jeff Zekauskas","How much did your energy business or your energy end-market grow in North America in the quarter?","Matt White","The energy market in North America for just the quarter, year-over-year or sequential?","Jeff Zekauskas","The quarter, year-over-year.","Matt White","Yes it was down, we're down 1% on the global and the majority of that's driven by North America. So you could back into what that relates to on a segment basis. But that's really some of the upstream projects that have slowed a bit. But on some of the other areas in North America we haven't seen a negative impact yet. So Mexico as we've mentioned was already at a low rate, so we already have seen that stable sequentially and with the new budget even a little bit of an uptick. Canada right now we have not seen a significant slowdown but the expectation is when they go into the fall or the breakup here in a couple of months that they will probably come out much lighter, still remains to be seen but that's what we expect could happen. And on U.S. side we haven't seen a material slowdown, some of the upstreams that we've been providing are pretty low cost, they are pretty efficient wells. Where we've really seen the biggest impact to-date other than currencies has been our offshore dominion those tend to be the higher costs, incremental oil extraction. So those are the ones whether it be North Sea or some of the other locations in Asia that they serve that's where we've seen the biggest slowdown to-date.","Jeff Zekauskas","Is it fair to say that through the first nine months, on average, your energy revenues in North America grew in excess of 20%?","Matt White","Well we did have some assets that came on stream that are downstream, so they would have driven some of that growth.","Jeff Zekauskas","And that has driven some of that growth.","Matt White","Yes that's in the refining space, right. And as you know when you look at our energy segment two-thirds of it is downstream.","Jeff Zekauskas","Yes. But still, is it fair to say that you were in -- I guess in some quarters in the high 20s, maybe some quarters in the mid-teens and now the outlook for that is more flattish going forward?","Matt White","Yes but a big part of that is your lapping those large downstream projects that came on.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of David Manthey with R.W. Baird. Please proceed.","David Manthey","Matt, could you tell us how the $15 million in headcount reductions were spread geographically?","MattWhite","We don't -- that exact number we didn't have public but I can tell you that it's spread in Europe, Asia and North America primarily. And I would say probably close to half of it\u2019s North America and you could probably split the rest.","David Manthey","Okay. And then philosophically, your future assumptions for sort of the market growth, industrialization of emerging markets, and the global energy investment, as you look out over the next three to five years are your expectations lower, higher, the same as they were, say, three or five years ago?","Matt White","Just in energy in general or specifically on the Gulf Coast?","David Manthey","No, I'm thinking mainly just of the two areas, energy, yes, and then also the industrialization of emerging markets more broadly.","Matt White","So in energy I think anything that was upstream is going to be we looked at especially if it was something that was relying on a spread. And we kind of expected that I think as you may recall when we looked at gas to liquid projects we were sort of questioning their viability in the beginning, so I think projects like that will probably get a much deeper look. Downstream energy projects at this point I don't see any major impact. Now there was in the U.S. I believe a potential hydrocracker project that was postponed, so that could happen and that may happen. So I think the uncertainty will may be pause some investment decisions but if you are just making transportation fuels today I think holding all as constant you are probably seeing a little bit better spread right now, so those investments should probably still happen.","And on the plastics chain which I guess gets more into the chemical side frankly, as I mentioned earlier we haven\u2019t seen any significant change there yet. As far as the industrialization the emerging markets have had a challenge here for a couple of years now. So this is not in my opinion much different than what we\u2019ve seen over the last 18 to 24 months in the emerging markets. So we\u2019ve been seeing China\u2019s deceleration growth over the last six to nine months, we\u2019ve seen Brazil in and out of recessions for the last two years. So I think this is kind of consistent with what we\u2019ve seen and what we\u2019ve expected. But to P.J.\u2019s earlier call if currencies get to a point it could make their products more competitive and that might hopefully become a tailwind for some of the emerging markets, especially the more commodity driven ones as their currency makes them more competitive.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Please proceed.","Curt Siegmeyer","This is Curt Siegmeyer in for Mike. Just a couple of questions on the potential for share repurchases in 2015. You guys saw pretty nice jump close to 800 million in share buybacks in '14 would you expect it to remain at similar levels this year or maybe taper back off to closer to what it was in 2012 and '13?","Matt White","Yes I think Curt probably the easiest way to look at it in my mind is start with our operating cash flow. So $3 billion plus or minus and hopefully we can improve that more this year but start with that number. We\u2019re going to pay our dividends, so that\u2019s about 800 million or so, so that will leave you about 2.2 billion-2.1 billion left. And that is going to be deployed between our CapEx and our buybacks. So we\u2019re not looking to really lever up or pay down debt too much for that matter. So I am looking to keep net debt on a dollar basis relatively stable. So the amount of buybacks will be a function of where our CapEx ultimately ends. Right now we\u2019re calling 1.7 but if things change that number could be altered.","Curt Siegmeyer","And then just one on the project backlog, the 1.9 billion, could you just remind us roughly what percent of that is tied either directly or indirectly to energy and then what the composition sort of is of the rest?","Matt White","The energy is about a third, and manufacturing is probably a quarter, you got chemicals as about a fifth, probably 15% metals and the rest is kind of electronics and some other industries. But energy is the third and of that energy they\u2019re all downstream. Two of them are refining projects, one being Chevron which is delayed due to a customer\u2019s situation on permitting and the other one being Northwest which is really a fully integrated from bitumen to refined transportation fluids. So it takes the whole distribution from upstream to downstream. So those are the main projects in the energy bucket.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","David Begleiter","Matt, can we -- you may have mentioned this, what is the EPS impact from new plant start-ups in 2015? And what was in 2014?","Matt White","So we\u2019ll start with 2015, I think David as you may recall when we had laid out couple of years ago we talked about 3% and 4% sales growth on new projects and 2% to 3% sort of base underlying organic growth. And they were two important components to hit the high single-digit sales growth. And right now when you look at our '15 projection the two combined we\u2019re seeing 3% to 5%. So instead of those two numbers which we\u2019re bringing more in a 5 to 7 were now 3 to 5. So we\u2019re a couple percent short on that range. And I would argue it\u2019s really split almost between both the base and the projects.","The challenge in the base is, is frankly what we\u2019re seeing around the world, I think Brazil is negative IP, Europe is almost zero, China is decelerating. So those have taken that 2% to 3% organic down to probably 1% to 2%. On projects that 3 to 4 is probably or more like 2 to 3 at least now, and part of it is we just haven\u2019t been replenishing the backlog as fast as we need it to achieve the 3 to 4. So that\u2019s sort of how '15 was put together. In '14 it\u2019s not that much different. In the fourth quarter here we were probably roughly half from project contribution, half from base. And we\u2019re starting to lap some of the bigger hydrogen projects that brought some growth. So that\u2019s sort of how we\u2019re seeing this on a go forward basis and how we finished the year in terms of that contribution.","David Begleiter","And then just on U.S. packaged gas volumes, should they accelerate do you think in '15 versus '14? Are you up more than 2% you had in '14?","Matt White","We definitely expect growth. I think when you look at the numbers combined in '14 we saw very strong gas rent growth. Hard goods which is spotty was up and down but there were some negative low single-digit hard good numbers for this fourth quarter and a lot of that is driven by timing of very lumpy automation equipment. And Kelcey had mentioned that in the prepared remarks. So, we saw a lot of strong automation equipment in the early and mid-part of this year, I should say of 2014 and I think that was related to some of the difficulty of getting skilled labor, getting skilled welders and they went to an automation solution to help meet those needs. So those we lapped and that will put some strain on the automation equipment in hard good, but we still expect to see low single-digit growth in gas and I don\u2019t see any reason why that should be different in '15. I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna. Please proceed.","Don Carson","Yes, thank you. Just to follow-up on energy, Matt, last call you said if oil got down in the 50s it would have a real impact on your business, but it sounds like you're not really seeing that because it turns out maybe your upstream customers are lower cost than you think. So just wondering if you would comment on that or if that's one of the reasons why you are a little more cautious on the '15 outlook, just thinking that at some point you will see lower demand from your upstream customers?","Matt White","Yes, I think Don it\u2019s part of it I think is just a delay. So, part of our customers are hedged and when those hedges roll off if you're still at these levels they likely will slowdown or lay down rigs. Also you have certain customers that maybe in the middle of they have leased rigs, they have got crews, they want to just complete and finish their programs and get their oil produced and then when that program is done they may breakup the camp and lay down the rig. So it takes time to see this slowdown, I think you look at new rig permits that\u2019s drop drastically, so the future opportunity is limited, on existing production people are finishing what they have if they are hedged they will go longer. So, I do think this will drop if oil stays at this level, it's just not something you're going to see in one or two months, it may take three or four months. But I do think in the back-half of this year there will be some headwinds on this business. And Mexico which is a little bit different there was as we discussed in prior calls some more governmental components on the budgets that\u2019s at a pretty low level right now, we\u2019re going to have a very difficult comp in Q1 to lap with Mexico given it was quite strong in the beginning of '14, but that is moving more towards a government policy then really the price of oil at this point.","Don Carson","And then the offsets that you mentioned on weaker currencies in some markets an example would be Canada where you got a slide in the dollar. Would you expect let\u2019s say, Eastern Canadian manufacturing could pick up the slack and then offset the second-half decline in energy? Or is that just too smaller part of your business now?","Matt White","Well we\u2019re definitely seeing some pick up in Quebec and in Ontario in some of the manufacturing areas they are clearly more competitive, they do have a large supply to the U.S., so it's become 20 plus percent more competitive on a price basis. I think the question will be what\u2019s the long range outlook for people to make investments into Eastern Canada? But at least the immediate effect we are seeing is some pick up in manufacturing activity there just given the differential in the Canadian dollar.","Kelcey Hoyt","Okay.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce you host for today's conference, Director of Investor Relations, Kelcey Hoyt. Please go ahead.","Kelcey E. Hoyt - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Mallory. Good morning, and thank you for attending our third quarter earnings call and webcast. I'm joined this morning by Steve Angel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Matt White, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Liz Hirsch, our Vice President and Controller.","Today's presentation materials are available on our website at praxair.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on page two of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference.","In addition, please note that our discussion of earnings for the third quarter, including year-over-year and sequential comparisons excludes charges taken related to cost reduction actions and a pension settlement. The reconciliation to the U.S. GAAP reported numbers are in the appendix to this presentation and the press release.","On today's call, we will start with an update from Steve on the current business environment, the actions the company is taking to protect and grow profitability in this challenging macro environment and the continued drivers of earnings growth. Matt will then provide a summary of the third quarter results and an update on capital allocation and earnings guidance. We'll then be available to answer questions.","Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Kelcey. Good morning, everyone. I'll start with North America and begin with our largest market, the United States. Our volumes to the steel industry were weak in Q3, down about 9% year-over-year, as our customers continue to be victims of cheap imports and oversupplied global steel market. The cutback in oil spending also contributes to this weakness. We expect this trend to continue throughout Q4.","Our hydrogen volumes to the refining industry look pretty good. Spreads are good for refiners. They're making a lot of money in exporting product. Planned turnarounds in Q4 will lower volumes somewhat. Chemical industry volumes were down in Q3 due to some customer outages. Those customers are back up and running now. The underlying volumes look soft to me, though, something to watch going forward.","Manufacturing has clearly weakened. Our PDI packaged gases business is certainly indicative of this. Hardgoods volumes were down double digits. I'll remind you, we're not in the hardgoods business for the sake of selling hardgoods. We are in the hardgoods business to sell gas. Cylinder gases are flat. Practically every market category we follow was negative year-over-year, including metal fabrication, machinery, agriculture and transportation. However, our CO2 business, which largely served the food and beverage industry, is doing quite well as we bring on new sources. And our new CO2 business continues to grow.","Canada is in a recession. The west is struggling with weaker commodity prices. Our oil well services volumes are down about 40% year-over-year. Packaged gases are down in the high teens. The east is doing better with the weaker loonie but not enough to offset the west. Mexico, outside of Pemex, where we have seen nitrogen-pumping services for the oil industry drop 60% year-over-year. Outside of that, we're doing quite well. We're seeing solid growth, mid single digits from growing automotive, aviation and general manufacturing markets. Of course, the weak peso helps with export competitiveness.","Europe is generally doing better year-over-year. Pipeline volumes to the steel and chemical industry are higher. Merchant liquid volumes serving general industry in Western Europe and Spain are doing better. And we started up our project with NTMK in Russia, and those plants are performing well.","Asia is four countries for us; Korea, Thailand, India and China. Korea's doing well because of electronics growth. The remainder of the economy, which is heavily dependent on exports, is struggling. Thailand, which is focused on CO2 and food freezing, is doing very well. In India, growth is in the high single digits, as that economy emerges from a recession and the Modi feel-good effect continues. In China, which represents about 6% of our total sales, our volumes are essentially flat year-over-year. Metals is soft as a result of the pull-back in fixed capital spending. Chemicals is flat and general manufacturing activity is flat as well. Positives would be electronics any environmentally-related activity.","South America. Obviously, Brazil is in a deep recession. Industrial production is down 9% year-over-year. Auto production, for example, is down 30% year-over-year. Political uncertainty contributes to the 35% devaluation of the real that we have witnessed so far this year. You've heard me say this before, but I think the situation in Brazil will most likely get worse before it gets better. And that is our expectation for Q4. The good news is we've already absorbed most of the pain. Brazil was 18% of our sales in 2011. It's down to about half that number today. And we always grow at a rate faster than industrial production through increased applications of industrial gases, especially in food and beverage, healthcare and environmental. And even in the worst of times, we can hold about 20% operating profit to sales.","So given all that cheerful news, what are we doing about all these cyclical headwinds we are facing, many of which are blowing at gale force? Please turn to page four. The first order of business is to continue to optimize the base business. Continued price realization is an important part of that, and most businesses are delivering positive price.","Since last year, we've worked hard to make our organization leaner. It's certainly not anything we wanted to do, but given the market weakness we are seeing in South America, Canada, China and all regions affected by weak commodity prices, we have had to take these difficult actions. By the end of next year, our overall head count will be down approximately 7% from the beginning of this year. And as a result, we will be well positioned to leverage any economic growth we see to the bottom line.","Productivity continues to be a positive story for Praxair. Every year, we find new sources of productivity that enable us to sustain our performance and I'm confident that we will continue to do that going forward. And it is the combination of price and productivity that enables us to continue to grow operating profit faster than our top line.","Today, we have quite a few acquisition opportunities in front of us that will allow us to do two things. Number one, build density in key geographies like South America, Canada, Europe and the U.S; and number two, increase exposure to more resilient growth markets like food freezing. Our pending acquisition of Yara's CO2 business in Europe is a good example of the type of acquisitions we're targeting. In the next six to nine months, we expect to close more than $500 million of acquisitions, which will all meet our investment criteria.","Beginning in 2017, we expect to see heavier contributions from the backlog. This is a simple function of project timing, as several large projects like, North West Upgrading in Canada, the CNOOC refinery in China, and the Yara, BASF ammonia project in the U.S. Gulf Coast all come on-line. Today, North America represents 40% of our backlog. Given the declining level of proposal activity in China and Latin America and the high level of activity we are now seeing in the U.S. Gulf Coast, I do expect to see the backlog remain at healthy levels. But the composition will shift more towards North America and away from emerging markets.","All the headwinds we are facing, currency, both translational and its effect on U.S producers, Brazil and upstream energy are all cyclical in nature and will turn at some point. Far be it for me to call that turn. All I know is that when they do turn, we will go back to double-digit EPS growth. In the meantime, what should you expect from us?","First of all, let's assume volume is flat and currency is flat. Unfortunately, the current run rate of both suggests to me continued headwinds in the first half of next year. But assuming flat, my answer would be high single digits. How do I get there? Price, project start-ups and acquisitions will generate mid single-digit top line. Price and productivity will lever that further to higher levels of operating profit, and share buybacks will add another 2% or so to EPS. That is high single-digit EPS.","We'll have time to take questions later, but now I would like to turn the call over to Matt.","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks and good morning, everyone. As Steve mentioned, we continue to see challenging conditions in key markets around the world. Despite this, we had a solid quarter, as many of our previous management actions are mitigating the weaker volumes.","Looking at slide six, you can see our consolidated third quarter results. Foreign currency translation continues to be a headwind by reducing both sales and earnings 11% year-over-year. While we saw some underlying sequential growth due to project start-ups, we're still seeing negative year-over-year base volumes from weaker overall conditions in South America and lower volumes to energy and metal customers North America.","The vast majority of these customers are under contract so these volume headwinds are cyclical and ultimately will recover over time. And although the lower volumes have hurt our operating margins, we've more than offset that with higher pricing and strong cost controls. For the quarter, we were able to improve our operating and EBITDA margins to 23.1% and 33.7% respectively, which both represent all-time highs. So we are seeing the benefits of our restructuring actions. And we expect to retain them going forward, regardless of end-market conditions.","In addition to higher-quality earnings, we continue to generate strong free cash flow. Our third quarter operating cash flow of about $700 million more than covered our $400 million of capital expenditures and our $200 million dividend. We were able to deploy additional funds towards share repurchases and reduce our overall share count. In fact, we've been very disciplined and consistent on our capital allocation process for many years. Given the importance of this, I'd like to further discuss them in connection with the near-term outlook provided by Steve.","Turning to slide seven, you can see a simple diagram of that process. Capital allocation starts with operating cash flow. We need to manage all aspects to maximize this figure as much as we can. Our current operating cash flow is about 25% of sales, and it's fairly consistent given the contractual nature of our business.","Once we have the cash, we could three things with it: invest for growth, give it back to shareholders or reduce net debt. Our priority is invest for growth. But these investments need to be in our core regions and meet our disciplined investment criteria. This is true for both organic investments and synergistic acquisitions. We use the exact same approach.","We don't invest to grow sales. We invest to grow earnings and cash flows. Our after-tax return on capital has consistently been in the double digits, and our priority is to allocate more capital toward growth as long as the risk level is acceptable. As Steve mentioned, we're not seeing as many organic projects meeting our risk\/return hurdle as we had in prior years. However, we're starting to find more acquisition opportunities, given attractive valuations and the stronger U.S. dollar. So we're shifting towards synergistic deals, primarily serving more resilient end markets such as our recent announcements with Yara and Tecnogas.","Our operating cash flows are strong enough that we have ample free cash after growth investments to distribute back to shareholders.","Our dividend policy's quite simple: we strive to grow it every year. And that is exactly what we've done for 22 years since our inception. And in years like 2015, where earnings growth has been challenged, we still grew the dividend 10%, due to our confidence in free cash flow generation.","The remaining cash that we have after growth investments and dividends is directed toward stock repurchases. When our end markets and geographies are in lower growth modes like today, we actually generate more free cash flow, since the majority of our capital spend is toward growth projects that are only initiated with executed customer contracts.","The balancing factor in any capital allocation process is net debt. Our goal continues to be holding the net debt level roughly flat with 2014. While debt slightly increased this quarter, it was mostly due to timing and we intend to lower it by year-end. So our approach is to continue to fund growth and dividends with existing operating cash flows and use any remaining balances toward share repurchases.","Over the next few quarters, we anticipate more capital allocated toward accretive acquisitions, which would temporarily reduce our stock repurchases. Once these acquisitions are completed, we expect to resume our share buyback program.","And finally, we intend to maintain our A investment-grade rating. This rating provides us the optimal balance of low-cost funding and sufficient flexibility within our capital allocation process. And while some leverage ratios like debt to EBITDA and debt to capital have eroded due to the accounting impact from foreign currency translation, our free cash flow generation is as strong as it has ever been, allowing us to issue some of the lowest coupon bonds in our company history, as evidenced by our recent debt placements.","I'd like to wrap things up with the fourth quarter guidance, which you'll find on slide eight. For the fourth quarter, we are projecting earnings per share in the range of $1.45 to $1.52, which results in annual guidance of $5.78 to $5.85. Both periods include an estimated currency headwind of about 11%. Excluding currency impact, our full-year EPS is expected to grow 3% to 4% over 2014. So despite all the challenges, we are still growing underlying earnings and generating strong cash flow by proactively managing the things we can control.","I'd now like to open up the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you, Steve. Thanks for your update on North America. Sounds \u2013 it is a tough market. When would you expect volumes to turn positive, back half of next year? Is that reasonable?","Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think that's an excellent question. Now, you got to keep in mind I think what affects \u2013 there's two major factors that I talked about. One was oil prices and the effect that, that has had with the cutback in spending in oil; and also the strength of the dollar. So if those two were to change, if the dollar were to weaken and oil prices were to move back up \u2013 and these things tend to be interrelated, I think you would see a boost in metals. You would see a boost in manufacturing. So what I'm really telling you is, until we see some change in those two macro factors, I don't expect much in the way of growth in the back half of next year.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. And just on pricing in this challenging top line environment. How are your price increases progressing in North America? And what's been the impact of the weaker end market demand?","Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well I think \u2013 let me just say pricing environment's, I look around the world, is pretty good. I look at North America, and we did announce some price increases this year. That's something we'll probably continue to look at going forward. But I think the price environment, particularly given relatively weak capacity utilization around the world is pretty decent, with the exception of China, where we have a lot of oversupply; probably around 50% capacity utilization in the merchant liquid sector and a dozen or so players.","So that's an area where we've been struggling with price, where the entire industry is, I'm sure, been struggling with price. But other than that, I think the pricing environment is pretty much as it has been.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Your line is now open.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Can you talk about how much of the Europe volume improvement was related to the new project start-up in Russia? And also comment on what you're seeing in terms of volume growth in the packaged gases business in Europe.","Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Certainly. A lot of the volume growth that we saw, probably half or so, that 3% you're looking at was due to large project start-ups. With respect to packaged gases, I would say it looks pretty decent in Germany and the Benelux. Still pretty flat to me in Spain. That's the one mode of supply in Spain that's not performing as well. The on-site's doing much better. The merchant liquid is doing much better. But I'd say packaged gas is pretty much flat. I don't expect much change in that regard.","And then with Italy, Italy would be a little weaker. And then of course, when you go up into Scandinavia, in these oil-dependent economies, the packaged gases are fairly weak there, too.","But on-site, with respect to metals, chemicals, broad-base manufacturing that we serve through our merchant liquid business still look pretty good.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right. And then maybe just kind of another question on pricing. In South America, the pricing momentum seems to be slowing. Is that just a factor of, you've seen so much inflation and it had to slow, just the law of large numbers? Or is it a sign that we're starting to struggle to keep pace with inflation given the weak demand environment?","Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well inflation for us in Brazil is power, which we address largely through pass-through; and then fuel, likewise. And then the rest of the inflation picture is salaries. So our inflation is not as high as is publicized. We don't import products, so we don't suffer that problem. And we don't have an issue with any other feedstock costs that are inflating. Again, inflation for us is salaries, power and fuel.","So I would say going \u2013 we did a pretty good job this quarter, I think, on the pricing front. I think we'll continue to push that going forward. It is a very weak economy and we do have competitors, so that will put some pressure on us. But I do expect to continue to see pretty good pricing going forward. And the combination of pricing and productivity will take care of whatever inflation we see.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna. Your line is now open.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yes. Just wondering...","Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Don.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi. What kind of benefit are you getting from lower net gas in terms of your margins? If you could just quantify that. And then, Steve, Praxair's always had a great record at taking costs out quickly, but do you have to add costs as business comes back in different geographic areas?","Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So the answer to your first question, of the 50 basis points improvement that we saw on operating margin across the top of the house, I'd say most of that probably was lower natural gas. Now that doesn't take away from the great performance that we've had from everybody around the world to be able to grow operating margins in environments where volumes are weak. So we feel pretty good about that performance. But I would say \u2013 and probably most of that 50 basis points \u2013 30 basis points, 40 basis points, something like that, were \u2013 you could attribute to lower natural gases.","To your question, yes, we've taken out a lot of cost. We're still taking out cost as we go into next year, which will help, obviously, from a earnings per share standpoint next year. As volumes come back \u2013 and I think those of you who have followed us and back to 2009 \u2013 you know that we're pretty stingy in terms of how we add cost back. And I think that's \u2013 because of that, we're able to get pretty good leverage or very good leverage on any kind of incremental volumes on a very lean cost structure. And we're very conscious of that.","So obviously, if volumes start to pick up quickly, we can respond quickly. So nothing we've done is going to take away from our ability to capitalize on any recovery we see. But we will be stingy in terms of how we add those costs back.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","And then just as a follow-up on PDI, normally weakness in hardgoods is the leading indicator that gases demand going forward might not be that strong. So is that analogy still valid with double-digit hardgoods declines? Or is this more in big equipment items like automation, et cetera?","Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, for us, it was heavily impacted by the pull-back in oil well services. And we do provide a lot of hardgoods into those regions, both in the North Central and the South Central. And this lead-lag kind of question has come up before. I went back and looked at some of our history, and I would say that most quarters I looked at it looked to me like hardgoods and gases moved pretty much coincidentally. And that in a few quarters, it looked like hardgoods might have led the gases' decline maybe by a quarter or so.","So I don't anticipate any big drop-off in gases as a result of the hardgoods becoming weaker. We could still see some pressure going forward. But basically as I look at Q4, I'm pretty much expecting the same thing that I saw in Q3, both from a hardgoods and gases standpoint.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Sheehan with SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Jim M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. I was wondering if you could give us a sense for your merchant utilization rates by different regions. You've already given China, just the other regions.","Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I'm sure I could give you a sense of it. I'd say in the U.S., LOX\/LIN, which are our two primary products, are around mid-70%s. Argon would be a higher utilization in Brazil. Looks like about low-80%s, LOX\/LIN. Europe would be in the high-60%s, 70%-ish, let's call it. China, I talked about. India would be low-70%s, mainly because we just started up a large plant there and we have some merchant loading to go through. And then Korea looks to be low-80%s.","Jim M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. And on your return on capital, how do you see that trending over the next couple of years?","Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","A lot of that's going to be a function of what happens to the top two \u2013 the numerator, which is operating profit, normal operating profit after tax. So if we get some volume recovery around the world, obviously, we're well positioned to take advantage of that and we'll get nice leverage. And that'll move the ROC up.","The capital base is affected, as we've had some large projects that have been ramping up. Anything that's had merchant liquid \u2013 and a lot of projects in Asia have had merchant liquid. It's been slow to ramp. So that affects the ROC. And also, we did a large acquisition, NuCO2 in 2013. And with acquisitions like that, you're looking at the better part of 10 years before you're able to get the return on capital neutral to the corporate average.","And I think going forward, as we do some of these acquisitions \u2013 we're not talking about a ton of money; maybe $500 million, $600 million or so \u2013 that does have a bit of weighing-down effect on the overall return on capital because again, acquisitions take longer to become neutral to the ROC than capital projects do.","Jim M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. Just three quick ones. It sounds as if \u2013 when you did the walk around the world, how large is the risk of volumes being negative in 2016? Secondly on the CapEx, the backlog to sales ratio. Is there some level below which you would characterize it as not being healthy and that you'd be concerned about it or there'd be an implication? And third, some of the downstream customers seem to be starting to indicate that they think the next investment cycle might start around 2018 to 2019, where they have to start making decisions for the 2020 to 2025 growth period. Does that match with the way you're thinking about the cadence of a possible shift in the cycle, or can you shed some color on that?","Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. So your first question's about next year. Now we're going to be going \u2013 getting into the planning process next week, and certainly, we'll give guidance in January for next year. But we are going to have some project contributions. That's for sure. I think you could have negative run rates on volume in the first half and, of course, the second half comps would be better. So I'll wait and answer that question in January. But it looks to me like we're certainly going to have pressure on the first half, but large projects are going to help for 2016.","With respect to backlog, is there a point with which it's no longer healthy? I think $1.6 billion is fine from a backlog standpoint. As we look at contributions from the backlog going forward in the future, a lot of it is kind of based on project timing. Maybe this year is a percent or so; next year's a couple percent. And then as we get into 2017 and 2018, 3%-ish looks more reasonable to me in terms of contributions from the backlog.","And again, I think that \u2013 I'm too worried about it dropping much below that. Again, this is just a function of the amount of activity that we're seeing today in the Gulf Coast. And all those projects are large. So hydrogen supply, carbon monoxide supply, they tend to be very large capital projects. And there're a half a dozen or so that we are \u2013 that we're working on today.","With respect to what's going to happen out in 2018, 2019, I don't really know the answer to that, Laurence. I just know that what we're working on today is going to carry us, certainly, through 2017 and into 2018. And then the projects that we were to close, it would be probably second half of 2018 before we'd have the chance to start anything up. More likely, will be out into the 2019 kind of timeframe.","So that's about as far out as I'm willing to project. But to me, looking at the activity, I think for the next three or four years, I think we'll be in pretty good shape.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Sison with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Steve, when you think about South America longer term, what do you think about growing that business? Where do you think earnings can get back to? And historically, Praxair's been really good about choosing geographies and investing in certain geographies when it makes sense. What's sort of the plan for South America going forward, given the difficulties, the economies there are?","Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So obviously, today, we're very much hunkering down, been taking cost actions, taking advantage of some good growth opportunities in areas like healthcare, food and beverage, environmental. There are some acquisition opportunities both in Brazil and the rest of South America today. And this is where \u2013 we talk a lot about the negative effect of a strong dollar, but this is actually where the dollar helps when we start looking at some of these acquisitions.","I've said that pretty much in the worst of times, we can still hold around a 20% operating profit quality business. I think when they can see some growth \u2013 first of all, they got to get stability in the political arena. They need to get the physical house in order. But as I look at kind of Brazil long term, you have a lot people that were lifted from the lower rungs of society, say, into the middle class.","I don't think they want to go back. The institutions there are democratic. They have a democracy. They have pretty sound institutions. They're transparent. They have a lot of resources. They have some industries that are competitive on a global stage. What I really think Brazil needs long term is to have more Embraers, more companies like JBS meat packing. Companies that can compete on a global stage; they just need more of those kind of industry champions long term.","But as far as \u2013 people ask me when I think Brazil is going to turn. My answer would be, I think the next logical inflection point would be the 2018 election because the current party will not be in power when that takes place. And I think that is probably about the time that we're going to start seeing more confidence in the future. And a lot of what Brazil is suffering through today is a crisis of confidence.","So it will happen. They will come back. They always go through cycles, and they always come back very strong. And when they do, obviously, our volumes, you'll see that in our volumes; you'll see that in pricing' you'll see a much stronger currency. We'll get tailwind from that, and we'll be operating around a mid-20%s, I'd say, operating profit to sales. But that's not going to happen for a few years. Maybe I get surprised on the upside. I tend to be a skeptical kind of person. That's kind of how I see Brazil.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks. And then when you think about the factors affecting the U.S. in terms of industrial production, lower energy cost and stronger dollar, do you think those have sort of bottomed out now in terms of demand? Or do you think there's another leg down the next couple quarters or the effect of those on U.S. industrial demand?","Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well I think as far as the macro factors that I described, I think we're going to see that for a while. I think long term, U.S., you have to be bullish on the U.S. \u2013 and it's hard for me to be bullish on anything but I think \u2013 I would say bullish on the U.S. for a couple reasons. Number one, if you look at investors around the world today, the U.S. is the emerging market compared to all other so-called emerging markets. And the U.S., obviously, has much lower risk. So the U.S. market is very attractive. Energy costs are very low. And I look at electricity rates in the U.S. compared to other parts of the world that we participate in, and the power rates, electricity rates are lowest in the U.S.","You would expect that at some point, the U.S. is going to start building out or upgrading its infrastructure. And that's going to be very positive for the economy. So I'd say medium term, long term, you got to be a bull on the U.S. But short term, we got some macro factors that we have to deal with. I've talked about energy. I've talked about the effect of the strong dollar. And we certainly are affected by that.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. I was looking at your return on capital calculation, and your return on capital is about 12.5%. It was more or less the same thing a year ago. But what's happened is your equity is about $4.3 billion and it used to be $6.9 billion. And you've bought back some shares and you pay a dividend, but you earn $1.5 billion a year. And so what's happened to your equity is your other comprehensive income because of currency translation has pushed that number down. But it makes it look like your return on capital is flat in a world in which you're investing $1.5 billion a year and your operating profits are going down. So in general, what do you think your real return on capital is? And do you find that calculation economically reasonable now?","Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'm going to turn that over to Matt. Let him answer.","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hey, Jeff. How are you?","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sure.","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Believe it or not, we've actually modeled exactly what you're saying back in history. What you tend to find is this: the CTA to your point will reduce the denominator. But remember, you also have translation reducing the numerator. And while the timing may be different because the numerator will be average rate, the denominator will be end of rate balance sheet, over time they catch up.","So what we tend to find is in a longer period, a couple quarters strung together, currency impact tends to be sort of washed. You will see it on an instantaneous metric and you will see it kind of in a sort of quarterly metric. When you do like we do, an average over five quarters, currency kind of works its way out.","So I still think it's a valid metric. But as Steve said, the best way to grow this for us right now is to grow the numerator. We've been doing, I think, a pretty good job to keep the denominator in check. We've been doing a good job to mitigate in the numerator some of the headwinds on the volumes, but we're looking to try and grow this out in the next few years to get this number up.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then as my follow-up, how much of your debt is variable rate and how much is fixed?","Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","80%. 80% fixed, 20% variable. Is that right, Matt?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty close to that metric. We have some swaps that are maturing here that'll put us a little more fixed in the next four months. But right now, yeah, we're probably 80%\/20%.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you so much.","Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Your line is now open.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yes. Hi. Good morning.","Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Steve, you mentioned that North American backlog is 40% of the total, and you expect it to grow. How much of that growth is refinery hydrogen? And where do we stand on the chemical backlog with all the activity that's going on in the Gulf Coast? How much of that opportunity can you capture?","Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's \u2013 if I were to split the activity level in North America, I would say it's probably 20% refinery hydrogen opportunities and 80% chemical based. And the chemical-based opportunities would be for acetic acid. They would be for methanol. It would be for MDI, those kind of opportunities. And what's interesting about them is they seem to take a long time to get to closure. It seems like we're always looking at them, and they're going back and refreshing their feeds and so forth.","And it is possible that some of these people in the Gulf Coast are a little bit more concerned about cash today, even though they have very good projects on the drawing boards. But it's our sense that several of these projects are going to break loose. We feel very good about how well we're positioned. And that's why I say I think the backlog can stay up around current levels on the strength of what's taking place in the Gulf Coast, predominantly in the chemical industry, going forward.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And then when you look around globally in your steel customers or your customers in Brazil, what percent of your customers are below that threshold (41:23) take-or-pay contract? And are they paying? And it a bad debt issue that we should think about? Thank you.","Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we have quite a few customers and I don't want to \u2013 it's not a huge number \u2013 maybe a handful or so of large steel producers in places like Brazil that clearly are operating below take-or-pay levels, but they are paying. And that has been our history.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you and good morning, everyone. Steve, from your prepared comments, it sounds like you're anticipating a pickup in M&A. And I'm just wondering if you could talk about what dynamics are driving that. Is it broad based, or are these just very specific opportunities you guys have been looking at for a while?","Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well in some cases, we've been looking at them forever. I look at the one with Yara that we'll close first part of next year. We started talking about buying Yara's CO2 business when we formed the industrial gas joint venture back in 2007. So it only took eight years to get it done, but we did eventually get it done.","If I turn to the U.S., look at the packaged gas industry, a lot of people here we've been talking to for years and years and years. And when you're dealing with family-owned businesses, they tend to take a long time to part with those businesses. And sometimes the factors driving it are things like lack of a successor. But we are hearing more and more discussions \u2013 are hearing more and more feedback like, maybe now is the right time to sell while the economy's still doing okay, because it could get worse.","And so we're starting to hear, again, more feedback like that. So that's kind of what's driving the opportunities. Some of it is just a function of things we've been talking to people about a long time. And again, maybe there are a few more people now that are thinking now is the right time to get out.","And certainly, you look at a place like South America, you have companies that are struggling. And we're certainly not going anywhere, and we view these as great opportunities to build onto our footprint and take advantage of some obvious synergies.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And maybe just as a follow-up, could you speak to sort of the captive opportunity set? And I guess I mean in both directions. Like on one hand, are you seeing companies looking to de-captivate? Or are you seeing less contract \u2013 or less project opportunity in some areas because companies are saying, you know what? Maybe it makes sense in a lower growth environment to keep this in-house?","Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I haven't seen the latter. I would say our level of de-cap activity's probably the same as it has been. One thing that I'm always cautious of is when you get customers whose financials are not as strong as they were. When they start wanting to talk to you about de-capping an asset, I think you've got to be cautious because we're not in the financing business.","And so we go through every one of those with a fine-tooth comb. To me, it's kind of like acquisitions. You may look at 20 to do two. And in think de-captivations are very much the same. You may look at 20 to do a few because, of course, like anything else that we invest in, we want to make sure that it's \u2013 these are high-quality assets, high-quality projects. And we're going to be proud to own them in the future.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Manthey with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good morning. Matt, I was wondering if you could give us an update on the $75 million cost reduction efforts from last quarter. I don't know if you mentioned what net benefit you realized in the third quarter and\/or what you're assuming for the fourth quarter before you hit that full $75 million rate for 2016?","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Sure, Dave. Consistent with what we said last quarter, the expectation is we'll really start to see the bulk of the $75 million here in the fourth quarter. So really, our expectation is year-over-year in 2016, we'll probably recognize maybe three-quarters, a little less than three-quarters of that benefit. And this announcement we just did here for this quarter should give us another $5 million to $10 million of incremental savings on top of that.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. All right. And then on the competitive landscape, Steve, you mention that you're achieving positive price in almost all of your businesses. And I'm just wondering if we can gauge that. How sustainable is that in an environment that is fairly lackluster and maybe getting marginally worse? What are your thoughts on pricing going forward, assuming things don't roll over dramatically?","Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean we have an organization that is very much geared towards knowing how to manage price. And inflation is something we look at very carefully. And I'm just \u2013 I'm confident that we can continue to grow price going forward, at least a percent per year. I think historically to back and look over last \u2013 probably as far back as you want to go, we've averaged at least 2% per year. Now we're kind of saying it's 1%-ish, maybe a little better. But I feel confident in that number. And if we could get a bit of a turnaround in a place like China, obviously, we could do better. But the rest of the world's doing pretty well.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Your line is now open.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Morning. I've been going back and forth between other call, so I apologize if this has been asked. But you've got a competitor spinning off its non-gases business to put a premium on, focus on gases. Could you give us an update on the role of Surface Technologies in the portfolio?","Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's obviously not strategic to industrial gases. And so it is something that we have looked at from time to time. It's going to be a question of value. It's a strong business and certainly not anything we'd want to give away. But right now, we have some interesting things going on in the PST business. We have a very strong \u2013 we have a very interesting deal that we're working on that's going to really increase the value of that business. And so that's how I'd answer that question at this point.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. In what way would it increase the value of the business? Can you at least conceptualize for us what you're looking at?","Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'm not going to get into specifics yet. That'll all become much clearer in the coming months.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Steve, I was wondering if \u2013 there's obviously a cyclicality of the capital spending in the industry. I'm curious if you see any cyclicality to the return thresholds on projects. In other words, as you and your competitors get a little more miserly with your spending, does the scarcity or lower level of bid projects reduce returns? Or does the scrutiny increase returns or does it hold about the same?","Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'm going to answer it that I think the returns are holding about the same as what we have seen in the past. The activity that I \u2013 we're mainly engaged in today in North America \u2013 what I like about all these projects is they have very solid terms and conditions, very high guaranteed cash flows. So they've been de-risked, to a large extent. But again, I'd answer the question by saying I think the returns are pretty steady with where they've been. And it seems like all the competitors have areas that they're focused on, somewhat different than each other. And I think that's a pretty healthy thing.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And on your CO2 business in North America, it sounds like it's continuing to do quite well. Maybe I'm wrong, but I wouldn't imagine that the end market in CO2 is all that robust as people move away from carbonated beverages. So is that a function of just increasing and spreading that footprint or density and taking share? Or is there some underlying growth in beer and other things that I'm maybe not counting?","Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. No, it's a bit of a mixed bag. I think when you looked at \u2013 obviously, soft drink sales are down; carbonated beverages are down. However, anytime somebody opens up a restaurant, they need a carbonation service, and that's where NuCO2 comes in. So even though CO2 volumes themselves could be lower as a result of weaker soft drink sales, the fact that every new location needs a carbonation service means that we're able to grow that business. It is true that the craft brew business continues to grow double digits, so that's been a positive for us.","We've been a bit disadvantaged in recent years in that we haven't had as strong sources of CO2 as we would like. We've solved that all within the last year, so we feel very good about our CO2 business from a source standpoint which is critical to being successful. And then I look at the food-freezing business itself is growing with CO2 and also dry ice. Dry ice is an area that we haven't focused on historically, but that's a market that's growing pretty nicely. And market segments like biopharma are helping to drive the growth in dry ice.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And due to time, our last question will come from David Silver with Morningstar. Your line is now open.","David Silver - Morningstar Research","Yeah. Hi. Thanks. I'd like ask a question about the currency effect and maybe how it works on the global bidding environment. So I hear you talking about how the strong dollar is facilitating some of your M&A targets. But I do wonder about maybe when bidding for global projects, whether we're seeing the persistent strong dollar relative to the euro change the bidding dynamics. So if you could just about how the bidding environment has or hasn't changed, given the movement in the dollar versus the euro in particular. Thank you.","Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, Dave. This is Matt. I can answer that question. When we make these investments, like any investment, they're very long term, so we always model currencies, as I'd imagine all bidders do, in terms of what the long-term outlook is. You tend to source and sell in the same currency when you do these projects. You're building a lot of the assets. Half of it is built in local currency for the construction, and then you receive the revenues in the local currency. We use things like inflation protection, and sometimes we'll index to other currencies. So we've done that in all currency environments, high and low.","So long story short, I don't think it's affecting it at all because all of us have considered currency risks in effect in our investment process throughout our history. So I wouldn't say there's any material change on any respect.","David Silver - Morningstar Research","Okay. Thank you for that.","Matthew J.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Juan Pelaez, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Pelaez, you may begin.","Juan Pelaez","Thank you, Sarah. Good morning and thank you for attending our fourth quarter earnings call and webcast. I am joined this morning by Steve Angel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Matt White, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Kelcey Hoyt, Vice President and Controller.","Today\u2019s presentation materials are available on our website at praxair.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on page two of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference. In addition, please note that year-over-year and sequential comparisons exclude charges related to U.S. tax reform and the proposed merger. The reconciliations to the U.S. GAAP reported numbers are in the appendix to this presentation and the press release.","Now, let me turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Angel","Thanks, Juan. Good morning, everyone.","2017 ended on a strong note with growth across every major end-market as the industrial economy steadily recovered. The discipline and focus of our entire employee base enabled us to capitalize on these trends while simultaneously making progress towards the merger with Linde. In fact, on slide four, you will find some specific examples of successful execution of our strategy.","We presented the strategy approximately three years ago as commodity prices, emerging markets and industrial activity were collectively in decline. Our goal was to optimize the base business, capture quality growth opportunities, and position the Company for strong recovery when industrial markets improve. And I\u2019m proud to say that the Praxair team has delivered.","Over the last several years, we\u2019ve taken actions to optimize the base business which has culminated to records for both operating and free cash flow in 2017. Matt will discuss the numbers in more detail, but all of our employees contributed toward creating shareholder value and making our organization more efficient.","While optimizing the base, we never took our eye off growing the business. In light the market conditions of the last few years, we focused our efforts on those sectors that were less cyclical or had fundamental cost advantages where our customers were making capital investments. Our resilient market exposure has grown double digits from roughly a quarter to 28% of the global portfolio.","Furthermore, we have taken a additional efforts to diversify and enhance the business portfolio through adding other non-industrial projects to our backlog. These efforts are supported by recent announcements of contract wins for onsite customers including nitrogen supply and process gases to EverDisplay\u2019s AMOLED manufacturing facility in Shanghai. In fact, as of now, electronic customers comprise roughly 10% of our project backlog versus just 2% last year. And that number will grow in light of new wins we expect in the coming months.","In addition to portfolio management, we invested in strategic markets through acquisitions and joint ventures. Leveraging our extensive supply network and process gas expertise in the U.S. Gulf Coast enabled us to secure $1.1 billion worth of new projects, and we are not done yet. I fully expect more key wins in the coming quarters as we continue to see strong investments around the low cost hydrocarbons. All of these efforts support future growth independent of the macroeconomic environment.","But, as macro conditions improve, we fully expect to leverage any cyclical recovery, as shown at the bottom of this page. And based on what we\u2019ve seen over the last several months, I believe we are in the midst of an industrial recovery, especially in the U.S. and parts of Asia and Europe. We have positioned the business well to participate in this rebound while maintaining focus to run a high-quality business. This is evidenced by recent growth trends from the business segments. But we also want to see margins expanding with this recovery.","While sequentially our margins have improved, we\u2019re lagging a bit from prior year. However, I fully expect margin expansion in 2018, which we are already experiencing in the first quarter. While executing the strategy we also made significant progress toward the merger of Linde.","I wasn\u2019t planning to cover what has already been completed but suffice to say, it was a tremendous amount of work that our employees successfully managed while we continue to run the business at a high level. That being said, I would like to provide an update on key milestones which you will find on slide five.","The takeaway of this entire slide is that we are on track. Regulatory filings are being completed, as expected, including the recently filed Form CO with the European Commission. In parallel, we are making good progress on the divestiture process. I expect bid packages to be distributed over the next few weeks after which we will narrow the potential buyer pool. We will also take advantage of this time to accomplish as much integration planning work as we can to ensure a smooth transition, post close.","So, overall, we\u2019ve made good progress. While we can\u2019t control the final outcome, we\u2019ve had very constructive dialogues with the regulators and milestones are being achieved according to plan. I\u2019m sure many of you will have questions about the merger but realize, there isn\u2019t much more I can say about the process or timeline other than these points.","Before I hand it over Matt, I would like to provide a brief update of business trends on slide six. North America, at 52% of sales has seen growth across all end-markets but more specifically strong recovery in the industrial sectors. In the last few months, U.S. industrial production growth for manufacturing has exceeded 2% and key subsectors of metal fabrication and machinery have grown mid single digits. This has lead to robust growth in our on-site customers for metals, downstream energy and chemicals as well as manufacturing for our packaged gas business.","Same-store sales hardgoods grew in the high teens and gas in the mid single digits for the fourth quarter. We also saw a substantial amount of capital equipment sales in the U.S. which may bode well for future industrial and infrastructure activity. Additionally, the chemicals market is growing double digits, while our metals customers continue to perform well as reductions in global steel capacity and improved trade balances have supported domestic production.","Our confidence remains high in adding new projects to the backlog from the U.S. Gulf Coast as we are finalizing contract negotiations on a few large projects. Energy markets are also growing double-digit in North America but mostly driven by downstream refining. Our customers ran quite hard in the fourth quarter as they rebounded quickly from the hurricanes. But, we anticipate it\u2019s a significant turnaround season in this first quarter, as several customer outages were deferred in 2017.","While oil pricing has rebounded, there hasn\u2019t been a meaningful uptick in our upstream business. Mexico has bounced off the low rates and we are seeing slow improvement in the U.S. but most customers are still operating in the lowest cost regions using slick water techniques that don\u2019t require very much nitrogen. If oil prices are viewed to be stable at these higher levels, it is possible we may see a return to formations that would require more industrial gases but we just aren\u2019t seeing much of that yet.","South America, 13% of our sales has been stable, but the 2018 election season in Brazil will likely provide some volatility during the year. Industrial activity still remains at multiyear lows, but the recent trend has improved with low to mid single digit IP growth over the last few months. Most end-markets have been flat to up, although manufacturing and metals have grown more than other sectors, which may signal some falling of industrial investments. I wish I could say that I\u2019m bullish for a recovery but the uncertainty around the political situation in Brazil will likely result in a continued hold on investments. So, at this point, I\u2019m not expecting much from Brazil, for the first half of 2018. On the bright side, Argentina continues to be a good growth story and the commodity rebound should help countries like Chile and Peru, but time will tell on the pace of the Brazilian recovery.","Similar to the other regions Europe has grown in all end-markets but most in the industrial areas of metals and manufacturing. Germany, Italy and Spain have all contributed nicely to the growth in segment sales and profits. However, the Nordics and Russia are still lagging on performance, just given the local economies. But overall, Europe continues to be a positive story.","Asia at 16% of sales has been our strongest growth story for the year, both organically and for the onsite contracts for the project backlog. Double-digit volume growth in chemicals, electronics, manufacturing and metals have contributed to the results. As the Chinese economy rationalizes excess production capacity in key markets like steel, we have benefited from a combination of being partnered with the right onsite customers and improved supply-demand balance in the merchant liquid market.","Pricing has improved several quarters in a row as pent up inflation is working through the supply chain. In China and more specifically Korea, we continue to see significant onsite opportunities around electronics, primarily high purity nitrogen but also other process gases used in fabs. In 2017, we announced three new projects serving electronics industry and there are more to come. In fact, we are recently awarded a very large project, which I expect will be announced shortly. The opportunity set for new projects in Asia, especially electronics, has been quite strong, but we continue to maintain our discipline to only partner with the right customers and terms that fit our risk reward criteria.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Matt, who will walk through the numbers.","Matt White","Thanks, Steve. Please turn to slide eight for our fourth quarter results.","Sales of just under $3 billion were 12% higher than last year and 1% higher than the third quarter of this year. The table in the upper right breaks down the drivers to the sales variance. And you can see that volume is the largest contributor with 7% and 1% growth from last year and third quarter, respectively. When comparing to prior year, every major end-market expanded led by electronics, chemicals and energy.","From a segment perspective, Asia and North America had the greatest growth from a combination of recovery in industrial markets and project contribution. Globally, about two-thirds came from organic volume with the rest supported by project startups. The 1% sequential growth was also supported by U.S. and Asia as the U.S. Gulf Coast recovered from the third quarter hurricanes, and we saw general improvements in manufacturing activity in both regions. South America was seasonally weak as expected, due to the holidays and summer break. And market trends were also consistent with expectations as the energy market rebounded from U.S. Gulf Cost, which partially offset by seasonally weaker beverage sales in the Northern Hemisphere.","The price mix improvement of 1% was achieved from focused pricing actions, partially offset by some unfavorable mix impacts in specific regions, especially in South America and Europe. Asian merchant liquid had the strongest performance of the segments while pricing actions in North America were partially offset by the effect of higher capital equipment sales in our packaged gas business.","Currency translation is favorable 3%, primarily from strengthening of the euro, Canadian dollar, Chinese RMB and Korean yuan. Operating profit of $653 million is $54 million or 9% better than last year and $11 million or 2% better than the third quarter. This is the third consecutive quarter in a row where we have expanded operating margins. However, it is lower by 60 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2016. About 20 basis points relates to the impact of higher cost pass-through. So, the underlying margin decline from Q4 2016 is about 40 basis points. There are three main drivers negatively affecting this. First, is the unfavorable mix issues we discussed including capital equipment sales and overall South America. Second relates to restructuring charges embedded in the results, which you can see in the other income trends. And third relates to the fact that fourth quarter of 2016 had a lower run-rate SG&A as we had to reverse some of the incentive compensation accruals last year due to weaker results. But that is one quarter comparison in time and several of these items will not repeat.","As Steve mentioned, we are quite confident that we will be expanding margins in 2018 including the first quarter. More importantly, our operating cash flow margins have increased for three straight years to a record 27% in 2017, which I\u2019ll speak to on the next slide.","Our balance sheet continues to improve a strong capital management and cash generation. Return on capital has steadily risen each quarter, reaching 12.5% by year-end. I expect that number to continue to improve throughout 2018. Our available operating cash flow which represents operating cash flow minus non-backlog or what we call base CapEx has grown to almost $600 million for the quarter, as we have managed base CapEx and also increased operating cash flow.","Please turn to slide nine for more details on our cash flow performance. The left part of this slide provides a multiyear trend for operating and free cash flow. A few things that I\u2019d like to point out.","First, you can see that 2017 represented a record for both metrics. This result is a combination of many efforts from our employees around the world. Second, free cash flow has steadily increased over the period as the organization managed capital spending in line with the underlying growth prospects. Finally, the quality of the business has also steadily increased as operating cash flow margins have improved from 19% to 27%. Said differently, in 2017, for every dollar of sales, we generated $0.27 of operating cash flow that we could either return to shareholders or invest for future growth. This is a very compelling story of both the resiliency of our business as well as the ability to leverage a recovery like we\u2019ve seen over the last several quarters.","The right part of this slide shows how we used the $3 billion of operating cash flow in 2017,m resulting in the balance of growth investments, shareholder returns and debt reduction. We\u2019re currently pausing stock repurchases during the proposed merger. So, I anticipate further declines in net debt, leading up to close.","Please turn to slide 10 for tax and guidance update. In the fourth quarter, we booked a tax reform charge of $394 million or a $1.36 of EPS. This charge is comprised of three pieces, a $467 million charge for the deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings; a $260 million charge for foreign withholding taxes related to anticipated repatriated foreign earnings; and a $333 million benefit associated with the revaluation of a deferred tax liability from 35% to 21%. There is no immediate cash impact from this charge but cash will be impacted over several years as the liabilities are settled. This charge represents our best estimate of the current tax reform, but it is subject to change as new information becomes available.","Looking forward, I anticipate the new tax reform will lower our current effective tax rate down to a range of 23% to 25%, depending upon how specific aspects of the reform are ultimately clarified by the U.S. Treasury Department. For purposes of guidance, we are assuming a tax rate near the middle of that range, which provides a quarterly benefit of approximately $0.05 when compared our run rate.","As far as guidance, the EPS estimate for the first quarter is in the range of $1.53 to $1.58, which includes the $0.05 for tax reform. First quarter is seasonally slower due to Lunar New Year and Carnival. Furthermore, U.S. Gulf Coast customers are undergoing a significant amount of turnarounds as several slated for 2017 were deferred into this quarter. Despite these known headwinds, we are expecting continued contribution from underlying price and volume, which will improve operating leverage.","We did not provide a full year guidance range in light of the anticipated merger close date. As such, we do not expect Praxair will finish 2018 as a standalone publicly traded company. Our focus is to continue operating at a high level performance while supporting the merger integration planning efforts for a successful start to Linde plc. We believe it is more appropriate to provide quarterly guidance for Praxair, as the focus shifts to the new combined company in the second half of the year.","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Mike Sison","Hey, good morning, nice quarter there. Steve, when you think about Brazil, and I understand that you\u2019re not willing to think there\u2019s a recovery yet. But in the event that there is potential, where do you think margins or the potential for the Brazil segment is down the road?","Steve Angel","Well, our goal is to get it back to 20, and everybody understands that\u2019s the objective. I think for that to happen, we need to get more lift from the core manufacturing sector. I mean, you\u2019ve heard some positives that people reported automotives is up a bit, I think metal export is up a little bit, pulp and paper is up some, agriculture is always fairly strong. But, really, the base manufacturing, core manufacturing sector has not seen that yet. And again, I think we heard some, what I\u2019ll call, a good news, that the past President\u2019s conviction was upheld couple of days ago. So, he will be a factor in the elections and he has a lot of popular support. But, there\u2019s still going to be some volatility in the political climate. But, to get back and answer your question, we\u2019ve run as high as 22, 23 in years past. So, our again is to get it back to 20.","Mike Sison","Great. And then, follow-up on, in Asia pricing, I think it\u2019s the third quarter in a row you\u2019ve had positive pricing. Can you maybe talk about some of the dynamics in China that\u2019s supporting that? And then, I mean, could this be a kind of a multiyear upside potential in terms of pricing for Asia?","Steve Angel","Well, it should be. And most of what\u2019s driving that number is China, just to be specific. So, you know you\u2019ve heard me talk about China in the past where we were really unhappy with the level of pricing and there were several factors at play; there was excess supply in the merchant liquid market; you had captive steel companies and so forth, putting byproduct market into the supply. So, what has changed there is really a couple of things, and one of which is, if you look at the merchant liquid capacity utilization today and that\u2019s usually a question I get somewhere along the line, I mean, we\u2019re in the 90s in terms of capacity utilization. And we\u2019re not alone in terms of the fact that given the growth, and there hasn\u2019t been the pace of merchant liquid capacity adds that we used to see in the past that that market has tightened up, and that\u2019s a good thing. And then, the second thing, it was in my comments, was China is very serious about managing the environment. They realize they had overcapacity in many sectors, one of which was metals. Again, that\u2019s where we saw a lot of excess product come into the market. So, as those tier 2, tier 3 metals customers are rationalized, then that product doesn\u2019t find its way into the market, which is a good thing. So, those are some factors that are at play. And yes, I do expect this to continue.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Vincent Andrews","Thanks. Steve, you talked a bit on the energy side of things in terms of the upstream customers and not really seeing yet, and maybe we\u2019ll see it. Is it just a question of the oil price staying around here at a long enough level that it builds confidence or are there other gating events that we need to see? And, what do you think the overall, maybe over the next year or two, how much recovery in terms of EBITDA dollars do you think we could see?","Steve Angel","Well, it was at its peak, it was about 4% of our sales and high margin, as you heard us discuss. Today, as I look at it, it\u2019s sub-2%. So, yes, you would need prices at a high level, you would need confidence that those prices are going to be sustainable. And I think with that, we would see more energized gases like nitrogen used in more formations. And I\u2019d give an example of the formations that we would see lift in would be the San Juan basin for example in New Mexico. So, I would expect some improvement.","Would we get all the way back to 4, I\u2019m not sure about that. It would certainly be a nice bonus for us going forward in terms of our earnings boost. You\u2019ve got to keep in mind, we sold a lot of nitrogen for oil pressurization, for maintenance to Pemex. And they still have a lot of problems. And I said they bounced off of their bottom but they are nowhere near their peak. And again, energy prices have moved up quite a bit. So, they had issues managing the budget, but they also need to maintain the wells and they\u2019re constantly trying to balance that. So, yes, it would be nice to see. Will we get back to the 4% level, I\u2019m not counting on that but it\u2019s possible.","Vincent Andrews","Okay. And just a follow-up on the backlog and sort of your CapEx expectations. And I recognize, this is a standalone question that may no longer be relevant in a little bit. But with the industrial recovery, and I keep seeing press releases about large scale CapEx projects all over the world Middle East, Asia and so forth. Do you anticipate over the next few years that the investment opportunity is going to become more robust and that you guys will go after it or are you still a bit on more cautious side as it relates to the backlog?","Steve Angel","I think that the backlog number that we have today is pretty sustainable level, even as we start up projects, and it\u2019s just a function of the confidence that we have looking at the projects that we\u2019re working on, I made some comments about that. A lot of them are in the U.S. Gulf Coast. But, there is also a significant number of electronics projects that I\u2019m very optimistic that we\u2019ll be adding to the backlog in the not too distant future.","So, I think the outlook with respect to projects is trending positively, mainly driven by those two areas. And of course, with respect to the merger, I think that\u2019s a question that\u2019s better left for Linde to opine on. But, if you look at what they\u2019ve been talking about with respect to their engineering business, the fact that the backlog is strong, they have been adding projects too. And I think that speaks for itself. And if we are seeing opportunities like I described, you have to assume that certainly in one of those key markets they would be seeing similar kinds of opportunities as well, given where they are geographically positioned. So, I\u2019m optimistic in that regard.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Clark with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Your line is now open.","Peter Clark","Steve, one for you on the merge update slide. I know you can\u2019t talk too much on this. But, with the Q3, as you made it quite clear, you didn\u2019t see anything that would threaten the threshold. I\u2019m just wondering -- I presume that\u2019s still applicable given what you put on that slide? And the second comment, I heard what you said on Brazil with the sort of calling back to the 20% margin. But of course, this business was doing 500 basis points higher than where you are today, that would be about 300 basis points. I realize, there is some mix change here as more resilient business. But against that obviously you have ripped costs. You\u2019ve got more on-site actually, accepting the threshold issue there. I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019re being understandably cautious, given the experience you had.","Steve Angel","I\u2019ll take the last question possibly, but then again, the economy has to recover, the markets that we make a lot of margin in which is the merchant liquid markets, it\u2019s the liquid argon, it\u2019s the packaged gases. Those markets, those segments have to start growing at a much faster pace. Obviously 20% is not a cap that I put on South America. But, I think given where we are today, that\u2019s a reasonable objective, I\u2019ll say, in the near to medium term. And that\u2019s all I really have to say about Brazil at the time. You are correct in the sense that we have been working on the cost. We\u2019ve also been working on our go-to-market structure and making some changes around that that we think will be helpful in the long-term. So, we continue to work that equation. But, yes, back to your original question, we do not believe that the threshold is going to be threatened, and we are still maintaining our view of that.","Operator","And our next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Duffy Fischer","Both, Matt and Steve, you\u2019ve referenced, you think that margins are going to expand throughout this year. Can you talk a little bit about what the drivers of that expansion are? And then, proffer some kind of a bogey, is it 0.5%, 1%, how much could those margins expand throughout the year?","Steve Angel","Well, I\u2019ll speak in terms of this. And again, we didn\u2019t deliberately give guidance too far out. But, as I\u2019m looking at, we talked about the first quarter. So, kind of the algorithm on the top-line is, we\u2019ve said large projects contribute about two to the top-line and about three to the bottom-line. So that obviously helps with margin leverage in and of itself. Call currency zero, pass-through zero, then what\u2019s left is price and mix but let\u2019s say price and volume, we think price is going to be in the 1 trending to 2% kind of level, that\u2019s our objective. And then in terms of volume, we had some good growth obviously in Q4, we think that that trend is going to continue. Of course, you have some seasonal effects that Matt talked about which don\u2019t change and the heavy turnarounds at HyCO. But, year over year we\u2019re going to see some volume growth. So, we believe that top line\u2019s going to be in the mid single digit range, maybe in the upper end of the mid single digit range and then we\u2019ll be able to leverage the margins up from that into the high single digits and perhaps push in double digits.","Duffy Fischer","Great, and then just to shift to electronics, it seems with the three wins you had last year, you\u2019re talking about a couple more wins, maybe now like you\u2019re punching above your weight in electronics. If you would agree with that that you\u2019re kind of taking market share there, what\u2019s changed in that dynamic that has allowed you to do that?","Steve Angel","I had to laugh a bit, punching above our weight. So, a lot of electronics activity is, tell me who the end customer is that\u2019s doing the buying or that\u2019s making the major investments for growth. And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any secret that Samsung is the 800-pound gorilla in terms of the investments they\u2019re making in semiconductor and also in display. I think, I saw a statistic or I am pretty sure I did that said that in 2017 no corporation globally invested more in CapEx than Samsung, and the plans for 2018 are the same. So, they\u2019re making massive investments. We\u2019ve always been very well positioned with Samsung. We have a great relationship, long track record of reliability and meeting their needs, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re so confident in electronics picture going forward. There are other projects obviously that we won in China, there was one or two in the U.S. as well, but again, Samsung\u2019s 800-pound gorilla in the electronic space.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Laurence Alexander","Good morning, two quick questions. It looks as if with the timing of the new on-sites, your chemical business will be growing mid-teens, probably through 2019 or even 2020. Is that right, or are there any offsets to that?","Steve Angel","I think that\u2019s about right but chemicals in the U.S. for sure, because of the project startups, I\u2019m pretty sure that Matt would look at that way. And then, of course in places like China, there\u2019s chemicals activity as well but that\u2019s more of a function of really just economic growth in China.","Laurence Alexander","And secondly, is there any sense in which your run rate productivity has been delayed or distracted ahead of the merger or should we just use the usual algorithm on that side?","Steve Angel","Nothing has changed. In fact, we\u2019ve made it a point across the business to make sure that we continue to execute on all the programs, initiatives, base business that we normally would. And fortunately, as we work through this merger process, we only involve people in the merger process, integration planning that need to be involved at that time. And we\u2019ve been able to manage that quite well. But, to your more specific question, the productivity programs look very solid to me. We continue to evolve that productivity pipeline with new initiatives around things like more predictive diagnostic capability and so forth. But, the productivity pipeline, the execution of the pipeline, I still think is in good shape. And that\u2019s what I would say about that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks very much. I think earlier in the call, Steve, you talked about prices for 2018 perhaps edging up from 1% to 2%. And you also say that your own utilization rates were very high? Is your optimism about pricing a reflection of your views on capacity utilization in the industry or industrial gas capacity utilization rates rising meaningfully or is there something else behind the possible price increase?","Steve Angel","Well, it really is region by region. Of course, there are local businesses. So, you have to look at it that way. The comment I made, Jeff, was really around China that we have very high capacity utilization as does the industry, generally speaking. So, that is always helpful in terms of our ability to raise prices. If I look around in other parts of the world, you still have some regions that are in the 70, some that are mid-70s. And so that situation really hasn\u2019t corrected itself yet.","I would say, generally speaking, though we talk about Brazil go in the other direction where they\u2019ve historically been high inflation, now they\u2019re low inflation, sub-3%. Most parts of the world are seeing some inflation. I can look at Mexico, I can see some inflation; I can look at other parts where inflation is starting to become more of a factor. And so for us, coming into the year, this is something we talk about at our leadership conference that we want to make sure we get out ahead of that inflation curve. We want to make sure that given we\u2019re seeing some good volume growth in certain regions that we also make sure that we\u2019re taking advantage of the pricing opportunities that exist there. And that\u2019s what I\u2019ve seen one month into the first quarter.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks for that. Maybe question for Matt. Your SG&A was up a lot in the quarter, maybe by about 11%. And you talked about some of the factors that were behind that. What kind of SG&A growth do you expect for 2018 exclusive of the Linde merger?","Matt White","Yes, Jeff. So, maybe just to comment on, call it 2016 or 2017. I think looking at the year, full year is probably a little bit better, just given some of the timing movements. As you know there is a variable component of incentives which gets trued up. So, when I look at full year 2016-2017, SG&A is up about 5%. Roughly a percent of that is FX and the remainder is 4%. And probably half of that does relate to some of the incentive impact, as I\u2019ve mentioned in the prepared remarks. In 2016, we really reduced that number down quite low, given the weaker performance and that we did not reach a lot of our targets. So, you\u2019re looking at kind of a couple of percent I think natural growth, which is in line I think with inflation, in line with what you\u2019d expect merit impact. And I see no reason why, looking into 2018 why that would be any different. So, when I remove that variable component which can go up and down, I think just kind of the low single digit inflation like number is what we tend to see in normal years.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Ian Bennett","This is Ian Bennett on for Steve. Steve, you mentioned earlier about positive pricing expectation in China, and part of that was the environmental initiatives having an effect on the supply from these tier 2 and 3 providers. Are you seeing any beginning signs of increased demand for gases as a potential to solve some of their environmental needs?","Steve Angel","Well, as a matter of fact, yes. I mean, that\u2019s part of the growth profile that we are seeing in China. Water treatment has been really quite strong for the past year. But, we are also seeing some of our major steel customers start to utilize more oxygen in their steelmaking process, and this is for environmental reasons. And so, yes, the answer is yes. We\u2019re seeing -- the focus on the environment creates business opportunities for us and we are capitalizing on that.","Ian Bennett","And then, I just want to follow up on the merger. Is there any possibility to close meaningfully before the long-stop date in October?","Steve Angel","Well, that\u2019s going to be a function of the timing of the regulatory approvals, all of them, and negotiation of the remedies that are required. And that is something we spend a lot of time working on, planning. I think it\u2019s possible that we could -- we will certainly close before October 24. But as far as how earlier, it\u2019s really just a function of the things that I said. We\u2019ve said that in all likelihood, it will be in the second half. And the long-stop date is the October 24, so somewhere between the beginning of the third quarter and the long-stop date is when we anticipate closing.","Operator","Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Your line is now open.","P.J. Juvekar","Steve, you walked us through your growth and margin analysis, but if I look at your quarter, your sales were up just under 12% and your operating profits were up 9%. So, at this point, shouldn\u2019t you see more leverage, especially with high incremental margins from the merchant business? What\u2019s causing this?","Steve Angel","That\u2019s really what Matt walked through I think in his comments. And keep in mind, we had -- South America is part of that equation. We had a very strong packaged gas, hard goods flow in Q4 up close to 20%. Matt talked about the year-over-year differential and compensation, how that affected that. You do have some pass-through that\u2019s part of that. You had some ","restructuring charges that we took that were greater than what we had taken in the prior-year that\u2019s part of that equation. But, I think more importantly is -- yes, we should see leverage, we are seeing leverage going forward. We are one month into the quarter and we feel good about what we are seeing now. But, there were some -- there was a group of things that created that phenomena in Q4.","P.J. Juvekar","And then, secondly, you haven\u2019t gone as aggressively after Chinese projects in coal gasification or syngas. Can you flesh out your concerns, either about risk to these projects or potential low return returns?","Steve Angel","Well, we have a very successful strategy and that we outlined. And so, our strategy -- I won\u2019t go back through it, but our strategy is very clear in terms of where we\u2019re focused and the success that we\u2019re seeing, and we also have this little thing called a merger with Linde that\u2019s quite important. But every project goes through a risk return analysis. And as we look at some of the projects that we\u2019re talking about, our view of risk and return is -- it\u2019s not that attractive to us and especially given the other opportunities that we have which in our view offer a better risk return situation.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","David Begleiter","Steve, manufacturing end markets rose 8% in the quarter. Can you give a little more color as to why those markets did accelerate versus the prior year and even Q3?","Steve Angel","Well, obviously, there is some increase versus Q3. But, if you look at the U.S. packaged gas business, what we call PDI, had a very strong quarter from a top line standpoint. Again, you\u2019re reporting 20% on hardgoods, which was driven by a lot of capital equipment purchases during the quarter, and gas was still strong too kind of in the mid single digit range. That\u2019s a piece of that. But, Mexico is doing quite well from a manufacturing standpoint; Canada had a very good quarter year over year from a manufacturing standpoint. And there really isn\u2019t any weakness as you look around the globe. And I keep coming back to Brazil and South America, but everywhere else, Europe is showing some growth in manufacturing, China obviously is doing very well in manufacturing. So, those are the big drivers and that\u2019s how we got an 8% number.","David Begleiter","And Steve, just on your backlog, are you all capacity constrained in bidding for new projects? And also how is activity in the Middle East and India?","Steve Angel","Well, we are not capacity constrained. We feel very confident in our ability to win projects and execute those projects but we always look at our project execution track record, and it\u2019s been quite good. So, we\u2019re pleased with that. With respect to, you asked about Middle East and India. When you look at India, quite frankly, they haven\u2019t utilized a lot of the capacity that they put in place some years ago. So, the growth has not been dynamic enough in India to create the demand for new projects, not yet. So, obviously, we feel we\u2019re well-positioned there when that takes place. But, when you\u2019re kind of growing at 4 or 5% kind of number, you\u2019re not going to drive a lot of additional projects, not yet. And then, with respect to the Mid East, we\u2019re not -- we haven\u2019t been doing much in the Mid East. That\u2019s largely a sale of equipment market. So, we don\u2019t -- haven\u2019t historically focused on sale of equipment. And therefore, we just haven\u2019t been doing anything in that part of the world.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Your line is now open.","Mike Harrison","Hi. Good morning. Steve, just to follow up on the last question there about the Mid East being mostly a sale of equipment market. Does that mean that maybe it becomes a little more of a focus as you guys join forces with Linde?","Steve Angel","Well, I think, clearly, Linde has done well in the Mid East. And by large -- and to -- a large reason for that is the fact that they can build olefin plants, they can build ethane crackers, they can build a lot of the upstream plants that are in demand in places like the Mid East. So, they have more of a presence there than we have, clearly. And as I\u2019ve talked about before, they have a very good sale of equipment business. And you got to break that down. Half of it is things like natural gas plants, olefins plants and the like. The other half is really hydrogen plants, CO plants, syngas plants, ASUs, things that obviously that we\u2019re very interested in today and would benefit in terms of what they are able to do. So, they\u2019ve run a very good business. The engineering business is performing at a pretty high level. They are arguably one of the best, at the sale of equipment side of the fence. So, I think that\u2019s something that we will look at and evaluate as the merger is consummated. But certainly, as an entity, going forward, you could anticipate that we\u2019ll be more involved in sale of equipment than Praxair standalone today.","Mike Harrison","Got it. And then, just going back to the comments on U.S. packaged gases, I believe you said that the growth there was in the mid-single digits. Can you break out what was volume and what was pricing, and what are your expectations might be going forward for volume and pricing in packaged gas in the U.S.?","Steve Angel","Yes. So, my comment really is around -- give me one second here. So, essentially, they had a high single number in sales, PDI gas, and hardgoods is in the high teens pushing 20% and the gas only piece would be mid single digit, 4% or 5%. That\u2019s the sales line number. And if you kind of pull that back, they had a decent performance in pricing, kind of in the 1% to 2% range, and they are one of the businesses that I feel optimistic about with respect to pricing going forward. And then, the rest of that is volume.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Iordanov from Raymond James. Your line is now open. ","Tim Iordanov","Hi, guys. This is Tim Iordanov for Patrick Lambert. Question regarding taxes, specifically the tax reform. What do you think that\u2019s going to do to cash tax rates, going into this year and into the coming quarters? Thanks.","Matt White","Sure. So, this is Matt answering that question. When you look at on an average run rate, I\u2019d expect the cash benefit to probably be somewhere in the $50 million to $60 million per year range. But, you have to take that with a grain of salt. Obviously that\u2019s based on our current interpretation of the tax reform. Obviously, it could be very subject to change as clarifications come out. But right now, I would estimate it in that range of $50 million to $60 million. Obviously that is slightly less than the earnings. And that\u2019s due to the fact that with the upfront charge on the deemed repatriation that won\u2019t be a factor in the ongoing earnings, but clearly, it will be an effect on the cash. That all being said, for 2018, I don\u2019t expect any net impact because we are fully going to do some repatriation in this year and a withholding tax payments we will make on a cash basis, I anticipate to completely offset any of the benefit, primarily due to the rate differential in the U.S.","So, 2018, no net cash impact; average annual run rate, probably 50 to 60 based on current interpretation. But, as you probably know, on the deemed repatriation that is a step up formula for the cash, the first five years are an 8% of the obligation and then years 6, 7, and 8 step up to 15%, 20%, 25%. So, after than five-year run rate, the cash cost may go up a little higher and the benefit a little lower. But hopefully that kind of gives you at least an understanding. And then, as things change, if we need to update, we\u2019ll relook at that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical.","Kevin McCarthy","On slide 18, you referenced substantial improvement in your chemicals end use market, including a 5% jump sequentially. Wondering what\u2019s driving that, how much might have been storm related versus other factors?","Steve Angel","Well, I think some -- could easily have been storm related, given the storms in Q3, which would affect it more sequentially. Demand in -- say in China has been quite strong on the chemical side and keeping pace with the growth of the economy. As I look at the chemicals number year-over-year, I think we had a little projects start ups there and as well they contribute to somewhat to that number. But, really, demand is quite strong in the U.S. as many of you on the call would know. Chemicals volumes will be driven by just the growth in the U.S. economy, industrial production, resi production, and of course they\u2019re advantaged from a natural gas standpoint. It looks like that will be a situation that will be sustained going forward, they\u2019ll have a natural gas feedstock advantage, and they are exporting now more than they used to. And that all drives demand for the chemicals, particularly in the U.S. Gulf Coast and volume for us.","Kevin McCarthy","And Steve, as a follow-up, does the change in the U.S. tax regime make the potential separation of any non-gas businesses more palatable or more likely from the standpoint of tax efficiency and the diminished tax bite on any future divestitures that you might contemplate?","Steve Angel","Well, in terms of divestitures, they are going to be driven by strategic factors more so than tax factors. That will obviously be something that we take a look at any time that we\u2019re evaluating a divestiture where the tax bite may or may not be. But, I think, the overriding factors will continue to be more strategic, particularly going forward. Anything you would add to that, Matt?","Matt White","Yes. I would just say, Kevin, I mean, any U.S.-based asset if required to be divested holding all else constant, should have a better net cash profile and earnings profile, just given the tax reform in the U.S. So, from that perspective, I think it would bode positive on any potentially U.S. divestitures. Outside of the U.S., I wouldn\u2019t expect, to Steve\u2019s point, any material impact effect as people look at this.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Don Carson with Susquehanna. Your line is now open.","Emily Wagner","Good morning this is Emily Wagner on for Don. We were wondering about the Asian volume growth of 11%. Could you break out that base business versus new projects and how should we think about that mix in 2018 for Asia as well the standalone Praxair entity, given the strong backlog?","Steve Angel","I would say that volume growth is probably about large projects, half base volume. And of course, the large projects are driven by economic conditions. And then, your question -- I missed your question going forward.","Emily Wagner","When you think about the backlog for looking into 2018 and your expectation for volume growth if were to break it out between new projects and base business on the consolidated Praxair. Is the mix going to be sustainable or\u2026?","Steve Angel","Yes. So, we do believe the contributions of backlog are sustainable going forward. And again, this is based really on the strength of the projects that we\u2019re going to be adding to the backlog, as their contracts are signed and they\u2019re announced. I think, the right number is a 2% top-line, 3% bottom-line contribution from the projects, really over the next several years. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve said before and we feel very confident in that going forward. A lot of that contribution will come out of the U.S. Gulf Coast. But increasingly, we\u2019re going to see some contributions driven largely by electronics that will show up in the Asia segment.","Juan Pelaez","So, thank you for participating in our fourth quarter earnings.

At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce Juan Pelaez, Director of Investor Relations.","Juan Pelaez ","Thank you for attending our fourth quarter earnings call and webcast. I am joined this morning by Steve Angel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Matt White, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Kelcey Hoyt, Vice President and Controller. ","Today\u2019s presentation materials are available on our website at Praxair.com in the investor section. Please read the forward-looking disclosure section on page two of the Slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference. In addition, please also note that our discussion of earnings including year-over-year and sequential comparisons excludes previously disclosed adjustments in 2016 and 2015. These items are detailed and reconciled to the report GAAP numbers in the appendix of this presentation and the press release.","I\u2019d like now to turn over the call to Steve.","Stephen F. Angel ","What I want to cover with you is three things: give you an update on our strategy which I first reviewed with you in October 2015; provide a few comments on our outlook; and, I want to address a few topics on our potential merger with Linde. Knowing that we could have a few years of uncertain industrial demand, we developed the strategy in mid-2015 to grow earnings regardless of macroeconomic conditions. You could find a copy of that strategy in the appendix on page 19.","I\u2019m sure you\u2019re all familiar with this already so I\u2019d like to walk you through some of the key actions we have delivered on in support of this strategy on page four. The first pillar of our strategy is to optimize the base business. This is a hallmark of Praxair culture and part of our identity. We proactively took measures in 2015 and followed that up with additional measures in 2016 to mitigate a difficult environment and that helped improve our performance. ","Furthermore, we achieved solid pricing improvement globally with a world with deflation. From my perspective the best way to measure our efforts is to look at the quality of our business. EBITDA margins of 33%, operating cash flow margins of 26%, and operating cash flow growth of 3% despite significant headwinds on base volumes. With strong cash flow we can continue to invest in high quality growth projects like we are seeing in the US Gulf Coast, increase our dividends, and take advantage of opportunities to use our remaining cash flow to buy back our stock. ","Even at these levels of performance we still have significant opportunity to improve so our work is really never done. Our objective is to grow our exposure to more resilient growth markets from 25% of our sales to 33% by 2020. Resilient end markets for us would include food, beverage, healthcare, specialty gases, environmental, and aerospace. Overall, these markets represent about 27% of our total sales today with several countries such as Brazil and Canada already close to the 33% target.","A key product to serve the food and beverage industry is Co2. Over the last three years we have increased our Co2 capacity in the US by 50% and by virtue of our Yara acquisition in Europe, Co2 now comprises 10% of our total product sales and is growing in the high single digits globally. ","We concluded our JV with GE last year on aircraft engine coatings which will triple the size of our business with GE Aviation to over $200 million in a few years. Furthermore, we improved our regional density in many locations around the world through packaged gas rollups and specific customer onsite decaps, all of which improve our operational efficiency and reliability. ","One of the most exciting and impactful growth opportunities of our strategy relates to executing and winning new onsite projects in the US Gulf Coast. We added several new project wins in the second half of 2016 bringing the total value of our backlog to just over $1.5 billion, 70% of which is concentrated in the US Gulf Coast and, based on the strength of our proposal activity today, I expect the size of our backlog to continue to increase until we begin starting up some of our larger projects in Q4.","Page five gives you a map of our production system along the US Gulf Coast. As you can see our project wins to-date span a variety of petrochemicals for global blue chip Customers. These wins enable us to further expand our dense supply network and leverage our existing infrastructure for highly reliable and accretive future growth. Four years from now I expect our production system will be 50% larger than it is today.","In summary, we have made significant strides on implementing our core strategy and the benefits have not only supported 2016 but lay the ground work for future earnings over the next several years. However, the unknown factor continues to be the macroeconomic conditions. Right now it\u2019s hard to see any meaningful recovery. Some key lagging markets like South America, metals, and oil have stabilized and US manufacturing weakness appears to be slowing, but we simply are not in a position to call a recovery yet. ","Furthermore, the recent US elections and fed policies have resulted in further strengthening of the US dollar. Matt will discuss some of these items further at our 2017 guidance. But, regardless of what happens in the economy, we have confidence in our stated strategy and all of our employees are committed to a successful execution. ","Before I hand it over to Matt, I have a few comments on our potential merger with Linde. I said this on the last call but I think it bears repeating, even though we are confident we have the right strategy, as I just explained, it is incumbent on me and the rest of the leadership team to evaluate all strategic alternative that we believe could create substantially more value for our stakeholders than our standalone case and we believe that is the case with this merger.","There are a few misconceptions out there, not widespread but I\u2019ve seen this a couple times, that I would like to address. First misconception is that we would be distracted while pursuing this merger. We will ensure that the right people are involved at the right time. For the vast majority of people in our company it is business as usual, which means focusing on operational excellence and executing our core business strategy. I am not concerned about this at all.","Another concern is if the merged company will suffer from conflicting or ambiguous leadership, cultural issues, or integration challenges, issues that can arise in mergers. First of all, rest assured the leadership structure and the operating model will be well defined up front so that the company can be run in a consistent and disciplined way in order to achieve maximum performance for the combined company. That is a must. ","We\u2019re not debating car design philosophies here, or what should be the ideal user experience, or how to integrate and manage a vast global supply chain. Remember, our products are homogeneous. Oxygen is the same all over the world and our products don\u2019t travel, that is why our businesses are, and will continue to be, locally managed. The job of the local leadership team is to optimize assets and value in their respective regions.","I\u2019ll add one more point, these issues, to the extent they exist, typically emanate from headquartered personnel. In our case, 99% of our combined headcount would reside outside of the head offices. I\u2019ve read some concerns about regulatory approvals and the required level of divestitures, which is an important consideration. Obviously, this is something we looked at very closely early on and if we were not confident that this was manageable we would never have pursued this opportunity. Again, these are locally run businesses and there are multiple examples of strong independent players all over the world both in terms of industrial gas supply and sale of planned offerings.","From a risk mitigation standpoint unlike acquisitions, mergers do not contain breakup fees associated with required regulatory approvals and we will continue to evaluate the risk\/reward tradeoff throughout the process making sure we have appropriate exit ramps if needed. ","Regarding synergies, we are still working through our analysis, yet we are confident in $1 billion of synergies, the vast majority of which is cost driven. We will provide more detail on this and the overall merger process when we sign a definitive business combination agreement and formally announce we have a deal which I believe will take place in the next two to three months.","This is all I have to say about our potential merger with Linde at this time. In the interim, rest assured we are laser focused on optimizing the value exchange for all of our shareholders, myself included. Now, I will hand it over to Matt.","Matthew J. White ","As mentioned earlier, we again faced some challenging headwinds, but we were able to deliver key aspects of the strategy which not only benefitted 2016, but laid the foundation for future earnings growth. Two areas that we had particular success were both generating and allocating our cash flow, which you\u2019ll find on Slide Seven. ","The $2.8 billion of operating cash flow was 3% better than 2015 despite net income falling 6% from currency and base volume headwinds. Furthermore, we continued to prudently manage cap ex spending while investing towards more stable fixed fee onsite contracts that will ensure future earnings growth, several of which are in the US Gulf Coast as Steve stated earlier.","The combination of these led to free cashflow of $1.3 billion. So, even though we saw some of the most severe recessionary conditions in South America and upstream energy, we were able to generate record free cash flow. I believe this speaks to the efficiency and resiliency of our employees, customer assets, and operating model. We remained quite disciplined with that free cash flow, given back about $1 billion to shareholders mostly in the form of dividends, and further cementing growth prospects with almost $500,000 towards synergistic acquisitions and joint venture buyouts that met our strategic initiatives. ","Keeping focused and discipline regardless of the economic climate is how Praxair preserves and creates value for our investors and 2016 was a very good example of that in action. I\u2019d now like to briefly walk through the fourth quarter on Slide Eight to provide some background on our current trends.","Sales of $2.6 billion are 2% higher than last year, but 3% below third quarter. Year-over-year, the 2% improvement is mostly driven by price increases and acquisition impact. Volume was flat as project contribution and growth in more defensive markets were offset by weakness in energy and manufacturing end markets in the Americas. Sequentially, we experienced weaker volumes, as anticipated, due to Gulf Coast turnarounds and seasonal effects.","Despite the lack of positive base volumes, we were able to maintain strong profit margins and generate operating cash flow of 27% of sales. Recall that 2015 fourth quarter results included a gain on asset sale. Excluding that, our operating profit is fairly consistent with both last year and the third quarter. So, we maintained operating profit in a challenging environment, but that is not our goal. Our goal clearly is to grow earnings in a disciplined and sustainable manner. ","We furthered that initiative this quarter by signing two more US Gulf Coast projects to our backlog. These wins bring our backlog to $1.5 billion which will provide a steady earnings growth over the next three to four years as projects come on stream. I\u2019d like to wrap things up with the guidance on Slide Nine.","We expect full year 2017 EPS to be in the range of $5.45 to $5.80. Note that this range does not include any anticipated costs from the proposed merger. While expense to-date has not been significant there will be more expenses incurred as the opportunity progresses. However, that isn\u2019t something we can project at this time. The guidance range does include an estimated 3% negative impact from foreign currency translation. ","By the fourth quarter of 2016 we had lapped almost all negative fx impacts and started to see some small fx tailwinds. However, immediately after the US election results, we saw a steep decline in some key foreign currency rates such as the Mexican Peso, Chinese RMB, and the Euro. Based on forward exchange rates, we think 3% headwind is an appropriate estimate. You can see in the lower right table our 2016 average rates for key countries that make up almost 40% of our sales, some of which are quite different than the current spot rates.","Excluding fx translation, we are expecting to grow earnings 2% to 9%. You can see the key drivers on the lower left of the Slide. We are expecting solid positive contribution from our project startups as well as additional benefit from pricing actions and net costs. We are getting positive lift from the large European acquisition partially offset by a divestiture in Asia. ","The real unknows relate to fx rates and base volumes. For volumes, we\u2019ve estimated a range in both directions and realize that the earnings impact will be greater than sales due to the operating leverage so we\u2019ll have to see how our key end markets recover and perform in 2017. At this point we aren\u2019t anticipating much recovery from current economic trends, hence the midpoint of the volume range at a comparable level to 2016. ","The first quarter guidance range is $1.28 to $1.35. This includes about -1% fx headwind to last year. This is less than our assumed -3% for the year since Q1 of 2016 had the weakest foreign currency rates for that year. Excluding fx, we are expecting to grow earnings 1% to 6% from 2016. Note that our larger projects do not start up until the second half of 2017, so most of this projected growth comes from existing projects, acquisitions, and organic growth.","As you may recall, that first quarter consistently is our weakest quarter due to the seasonal trends which explains most of the sequential decline. Overall, we feel quite good about our ability to grow earnings from actions already taken such as price, cost, and the project backflow. Furthermore, I anticipate another very strong cash flow year in 2017. ","The excess cash enabled us to raise the dividend for the 24th consecutive year and provides future flexibility to repurchase more stock and pay down debt to further strengthen our credit ratios. Consistent with 2016, we may see some volatility in base volumes and fx rates but regardless of the outlook, we are confident in our ability to execute on our strategy and prudently invest capital for future earnings growth and value creation. ","Before we open up the line, I just want to remind everyone that we don\u2019t have any further comments to make on the proposed Linde merger so I appreciate your efforts to refrain from asking any questions on this topic. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Duffy Fischer - Barclays. ","Duffy Fischer","I guess just starting out I\u2019m a bit surprised on the wide volume guidance range for 2017 EPS especially, when some of the cyclical end markets seem to be talking a least a bit more optimistically. Can you walk me through what macro environment gets you to the high end there versus the low end in your guidance?","Stephen F. Angel","What we\u2019re recognizing is that throughout 2016 the markets essentially continue to get weaker for the most part, so you can look at South America, you can look at upstream energy, I would say US manufacturing was pretty weak, never really made a turn, metals was fairly week. When we were at the third quarter we were concerned about metals and it ended up being a little better in the fourth quarter than we had expected but still no great shakes. Then again, the South America situation was bad and continued to get worse through the year.","We\u2019re starting off the year really at pretty much a low point. Now, we said in our comments we thought things had stabilized for the most part and I think that\u2019s a good thing. But again, starting the year from a low point - now, if things improve through the year and obviously, there\u2019s a lot of optimism out there, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of reality to the numbers yet, but there\u2019s a lot of optimism, if things were to improve through the course of the year we could end up at the higher end of the range. ","But, sitting where we are today I would rather wait and see the whites of their eyes before I start declaring things are starting to accelerate forward. ","Duffy Fischer","Matt, if I look at your fx guidance for both 1Q and full year 2017, it seems like your currency headwinds are forecast to kind of increase a bit through the year. But, given the late 2016 strength in the dollar I would have thought of it kind of at an opposite cadence there. Is your guide just kind of a reflection of a South American currency benefit still kind of hitting in 1Q, or how do I think about that cadence there?","Matthew J. White ","To state the obvious initially, is that they\u2019re constantly moving. We base it on the forward rates and the forward rates clearly have devaluation assumptions in those forward rates for almost every currency vis-a-via the US dollar. What we saw, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks is, immediately after the election results the Peso, the RMB, even the CAD a little bit, the Euro, even things like the Argentinian Peso had some pretty significant sell off. ","The Peso touched almost 22, it fell below 21 for a short brief point, I think, this morning so it will move around but we had kind of picked the forward rates as of a few weeks ago and set this on that. But, rest assured whatever the actual rates are that\u2019s what they\u2019ll be booked at. It\u2019s something that we\u2019ll be continuously updating each month in our outlook and then we\u2019ll give a public update for our next quarter results. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank. ","David Begleiter","Steve, just in North America do you think you can actually grow earnings in Q1 and if not in Q1 for the full year?","Stephen F. Angel","Grow earnings in North America? Yes, I think we can. I\u2019m looking at a situation and if I kind of just breakdown what\u2019s going on in North America you can kind of start with metals which is an important market for us. I think if you look at the steel industry, they are probably pretty well tapped out on automotive unless people out there think automotive is going to grow more than it has. ","In terms of what might happen with infrastructure spending and things like that, nothing has really taken place yet. Some talk of energy investment, it looks like that may happen but again, nothing has happened yet. Then with respect to energy prices, as I said earlier, oil prices in our oil well services business has kind of continued to ratchet down through the year and that\u2019s what we\u2019re starting off with right now.","If energy prices start to become a little stronger, we\u2019re already starting to see a little activity, but what we really need to see is rather than these water based fracs in places like the Permian Basin, we really need to start see energized fracs. That\u2019s our business. That hasn\u2019t really happened yet. ","Manufacturing we\u2019re kind of waiting and seeing. I think the pricing environment; we should be able to net at least a point of price in North America. You add price, you add the productivity which I expect we\u2019ll continue to get. I don\u2019t think oil well services won\u2019t get any worse, could get a little better, that would help. I think metals probably won\u2019t perform much better unless there are additional tariffs applied on imported steel. ","With this new Commerce Secretary coming in, this Wilbur Ross, he certainly has steel in his blood and so it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if he starts taking a close look at that which would certainly help the metal side of the equation. But you know, we still have a strong dollar, that hurts the exporters. It\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag, but we always think we can grow earnings in any region coming into the year. I think there\u2019s enough elements in North America that we should be able to do that.","Keep in mind, I\u2019m talking largely about the US. You look at place like Mexico we have a Peso that\u2019s a problem. What\u2019s going to happen kind of remains to be seen with the Peso. I think base volumes will continue do to quite well but I don\u2019t really think (inaudible) is going to do much in the way of investing in maintaining their existing wells and so that\u2019s not a favorable thing on oil well services with respect to Mexico. But, I think base volumes will be fine and it kind of remains to be seen what\u2019s going to happen with the Peso.","David Begleiter","Just on merchant pricing trends, you mentioned some positive traction in the US. How are those merchant pricing trends progress in Europe as we speak?","Stephen F. Angel","Let me just kind of back up a second. In the US I think we\u2019ll get price year-over-year in the US, but if I\u2019m looking, and I am looking at the past utilizations they\u2019re no great shakes, they\u2019re kind of high 70s, (inaudible) a little higher so it is not a particularly great environment for pricing but we always manage to eek out a point of price. If I look at a place like Europe where I would say it\u2019s certainly been more of a deflationary environment in Europe and the past utilizations are even weaker in Europe than they are as I described in the US, I think it will be a little bit more of a challenge. But, our expectation is that we\u2019re going to find a way to get the point of price on average around the globe. ","Some places will do better because we do have inflation in places like South America. Some places like Europe might be a little bit more of a challenge because of the weaker demand or at least demand that\u2019s not sufficient to really increase the past utilization in a meaningful way to help pricing. Then I look around to places like Asia, we still have excess supply in places like China. ","Each environment is different. We\u2019re very much focused on pricing in each environment and again, on average we expect to get a point of price really, regardless of the environment. ","Operator","Your next question comes from [Unidentified Analyst] - Keybank.","[Unidentified Analyst]","Steve, I just wanted to get a little bit of color on your comments that you and the board, when you look at strategic alternatives that if there\u2019s a substantial opportunity to increase shareholder value, maybe what that means a little bit? Is it over a certain amount of time? Are you looking at returns, earnings growth, sales growth? Maybe just give us a little bit of thoughts generally on what you look for?","Stephen F. Angel ","Look, I think every business has a standalone case. They have a base strategy and they expect that to be able to deliver a certain level of topline in earnings per share over a certain time horizon. That\u2019s part of what you do in a strategy review process which we do annual with our board, as do a lot of companies. We take a long term view in terms of what we think we can generate but we also look at it a little shorter term, because that\u2019s more relevant. ","Again, it\u2019s the value that we think we can create on a standalone case with our base strategy versus what type of value we think can be created in looking at a strategic alternative and I\u2019ve said this before. I don\u2019t want to get into a discussion on Linde because I said I wasn\u2019t but, when you look at doing something of consequence like that, we have to make sure the value is compelling for all our stakeholders and we believe that value is compelling in this case. That is the way we look at it.","[Unidentified Analyst]","If you heard Andrew on his call he was fairly positive with what the new administration could potentially do for manufacturing. If you think about that for industrial production or industrial recoveries, where do you think that could be meaningful for you? Is it more in the backlogs, is it new projects, just the base business merchant getting better, PDI? When you think about these areas, where would you have the most leverage?","Stephen F. Angel ","Well, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me that he\u2019d be optimistic on that. But, let me just kind of back up and talk about this, this way. First of all, we spent a lot of time talking about our success in the US Gulf Coast and being very confident we can continue to build on that for the next four, five years for sure. That\u2019s not really driven by anything that\u2019s happened with respect to this last election or any policies. That is low cost energy, that is established infrastructure in place, that\u2019s ability for people to invest and serve a very strong US domestic market certainly in comparison to other geographies around the world. ","Those dynamics were in place. Then if I look at really the basis of your question, the US is 40% of our sales so anything positive that happens in the US is going to benefit us. I would certainly hope that some of these things come to fruition. Again, I think infrastructure spending can be a big deal. It can certainly be a big deal to our customers and we would certainly benefit from that. But, how much of that do you really think is going to be available? How much of that do you really think is shovel ready in 2017?","That kind of remains to be seen. Again, that legislation hasn\u2019t been passed yet either. I think people talk about tax reforms. Certainly, that would be a positive. I think it would make the US more attractive as a place to invest, if it was a lower tax structure or more favorable tax structure. Some of that depends, for us, on things like how will depreciation be treated? Today, we can accelerate depreciation. I\u2019ve heard some discussion about even making that more favorable so that would be favorable for us, that would be favorable for our customers that would have interest in investing. ","Then regulatory. I don\u2019t think less regulations is going to benefit us quite as much as it might our customers. For example, our energy customers who they would argue they\u2019ve been saddled with some very difficult regulations over the years. To the extent that that investment would take off we would certainly benefit from that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Laurence Alexander - Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander","Two quick ones. The 33% non-cyclical target that you have for the medium term, is that independent of the macro and M&A environments? That is if there is an economic reflation you would still be pushing for that target? Secondly, how much of a headwind do you have in 2017 from divestitures on the EPS level?","Matthew J. White","On the EPS level I would say probably in the 1% or so range. There were really two, there was the Asian one and then our joint venture with GE was a partial divestiture even though it\u2019s being consolidated. There was an NCI component to that. ","Stephen F. Angel ","Back to your first question Laurence, obviously, one of the reasons we\u2019re more focused on or we want to focus more on resilient end markets going forward is that they\u2019re less susceptible to large macroeconomic swings and just a more consistent growth. Obviously, it wouldn\u2019t be as high a growth as we would see if you had a big snap back in South America, for example, or like you see in some commodity products that we participate in, but it\u2019s steady growth.","As I look at that growth profile going forward, I believe that we can continue to grow it in the high single digits range and that might move around a point or two either way but it doesn\u2019t have the cyclicality that you would have in say core metals and manufacturing markets which are very important to us. It doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t expect some growth certainly over that timeframe with respect to our metals and manufacturing markets. I think we will see some growth, we\u2019re just going to see more growth in those resilient markets and I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll continue to deliver that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Zajkowski - JP Morgan.","Jeff Zajkowski","Is the $13 million in other income stemming from something that went on in the Asia segment in that Asian operation profits went up about $10 million sequentially on flat sales? Secondly, is there some margin issue in North America because, even if you subtract out $20 million in operating income from last year from gains, your operating income is still down about $26 million on sort of flattish sales. Can you comment on those subjects? Where are the gains coming from?","Matthew J. White","As you probably know, every year we probably generate anywhere from $10 million to $30 million in other income each year. As you can imagine, it\u2019s a mix of settlements, gain\/losses on asset sales. We put things there that may not be either relevant to the overall operations and\/or they could be prior year\u2019s settlements or things that we didn\u2019t want to confuse with existing operating conditions. But, it is something that we\u2019ll continue as an organization as you know. That is what\u2019s in there. ","As far as the Asia segment, there\u2019s nothing that material. You will get more on the MDNA but really we had some pretty good volume and we had some sequential pick up. We did have a startup in Korea as well. These are all adding, and we had a lot of cost actions that we\u2019ve taken in Asia, as you know especially, in the middle of this year, and that has helped the margin there. The combination of those are more the driver on the Asian margin improvements.","As far as North America, yes of the $50 million reduction about half was related to that gain last year and the other half frankly, is the manufacturing effect, the upstream oil effect on a year-over-year basis. These are some pretty negative mix and higher margin impacts that have caused this issue in that region. We have a good business in Mexico and with the continued devaluation of the Peso it weighs it in less and less. The same issue with Canada. ","The combination of all those factors has weighed negatively on the margin. We had mentioned last call, if you recall, or two calls ago, that with the packaged business you lose variable margin until you take fixed costs out and that was another reason why we needed to take some action there. We do expect that to start stabilizing on that front and if we can get any recover it should be pretty accretive.","Jeff Zajkowski","What were your packaged gas on volumes in the United States in the quarter?","Stephen F. Angel ","The same store sales, you\u2019ve got to break it down and look at gas and hard goods, which is what we do. But in terms of what we call gas, rent, and other it would be minus low single digits to mid-single digits. Then on the hard goods side, it\u2019s still double digit negative year-over-year. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews","I\u2019m wondering if you could speak a bit about China. In the third quarter it seemed like the overall operating environment was sort of flattening out. It seemed like merchant contracts and so forth less churn, and sort of just an overall bottoming out, maybe some improvement or something to be optimistic about. I know you spoke about good volume growth in the new projects there but how is everything else doing and is anything changing about your desire to invest there whether it would be through new projects or through acquisition?","Stephen F. Angel ","As we looked at Q4 and I kind of dissect what we\u2019re looking at there, our volumes, our onsite volumes were pretty strong and so that would be steel, that would be chemicals. On the chemical side the methanol producers were pretty strong. We did have some projects startups that contributed, obviously, to that. Then on the steel side we\u2019re really down to one customer, that\u2019s Baosteel. Everybody knows who Baosteel is, it\u2019s one of the largest steel producers in China and probably the most profitable of everyone there. Our one steel customer did pretty well in Q4. Automotive is strong, that\u2019s a big part of their business. Specialty steel were pretty strong.","Our [inaudible] business was pretty strong. The merchant liquid was in the kind of mid-single digit range which I think is very healthy. We continue to focus on electronics business in China as well as environmental solutions, healthcare, food and beverage growth. As you know, part of the last five-year plan is to transform the economy away from fixed investment, capital investment and more towards consumer and services driven. We want to make sure that we are positioned to capitalize on that.","In terms of project startups, really the only thing left of significance is this project with CNOOC where we\u2019re providing hydrogen for that refinery to clean up the transportation fuels. That\u2019s really the last major project that we have there. That will start up towards the end of this year. ","That\u2019s kind of the environment in China. I think the government has had more stimulus or provided more stimulus to build out some more infrastructure in the back half of the year. I think you can argue how needed that infrastructure really is but it certainly took some measures to do that. Going forward, I think on a what we should expect in terms of growth in China, what I certainly expect is something on the order of mid-single digits. Again, it was a little stronger than that in Q4, but I think that\u2019s the reality going forward. ","Vincent Andrews","No change to your interest in investing there either organically or M&A?","Stephen F. Angel ","We will invest, but it\u2019s going to be, I think, much lower capital investment dollars than what we have seen. I really don\u2019t see anything in the way of an M&A opportunity like you\u2019re describing. But none of the large capital investment dollars that we have been investing in over recent years and the reason is I just don\u2019t see - again, if you go back and you look at what China\u2019s trying to do, transform away from a capital investment large fixed investment situation to more consumer driven services driven, I\u2019ve said before, I don\u2019t think they need another plant of any kind, they have sufficient capacity. That\u2019s what we see.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Roberts - UBS Securities.","John Roberts"," A quick question, in terms of capital allocation one, are you precluded from doing any share buyback while you\u2019re contemplating the merger with Linde, or in the event that the merger doesn\u2019t happen, should we expect Praxair to be more aggressive in terms of share buyback?","Matthew J. White","Yes, there are definitely going to be more blackout windows during this process. We experienced several throughout Q4 and I would anticipate there\u2019ll probably be some in 2017 as well. Yes, in an abundance of caution we are precluding ourselves several times from entering the market. That being said, I think we\u2019ll have sufficient free cash flow. We\u2019ll have the flexibility we\u2019re just going to have to be - certain times we\u2019ll be allowed in and certain times we won\u2019t in 2017.","John Roberts","Looking around the different regions of the world, where do you have the most concerns in terms of growth? Is it still South America? Where do your concerns lay?","Stephen F. Angel ","Well, I would say that it has been South America historically but things have been stabilizing there with the new government. Our volumes have been fairly consistent. We have found a way to grow in markets, as I\u2019ve been describing several times here, growth in more resilient end markets. It looks like they\u2019re starting to get their inflation somewhat under control, interest rates will follow. It appears to me that a South America, and I\u2019m talking specifically Brazil here, is kind of bouncing along the bottom and kind of looking for a catalyst for growth.","I don\u2019t see that yet. It might not happen this year. But, one thing for sure is if it happens we will be very well positioned to capitalize on any kind of growth or any kind of turnaround in the economy that may take place. But, quite frankly, that would have been in terms of concern, that was the concern but today I\u2019m nowhere near as concerned about that as I was kind of watching things transpire through 2015 and 2016.","John Roberts","Who replaces South America as an area of concern?","Stephen F. Angel ","I don\u2019t think anything compares to that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Port - Goldman Sachs.","Robert Port","Maybe on the energy side, what has been the peak to-date decline in energy and what would it take to get back to those peak sales from this end market?","Stephen F. Angel ","For upstream energy, what would it take to get back to the sales we once had?","Robert Port","Yes.","Stephen F. Angel ","Well, you\u2019re going to need pricing, energy prices to move up to a level that they once were at. I mean, that\u2019s really the simple answer. Now, the other side of that is you look at PEMX, PEMX needs to kind of get their house in order I\u2019ll say and they\u2019ve been a bit dysfunctional from an organizational standpoint the last six months or so. I think actually they will, but that has been a compounding problem I would say in terms of our oil well services volumes.","Again, I\u2019ll look at a place like Mexico, we\u2019re down at least probably 65% year-over-year. A similar kind of number in western Canada. US down quite a bit as well. But, the big lever would be higher energy prices for sure and the sooner PEMX gets their house in order, I think, the sooner we\u2019ll see better volumes than what we have seen down there.","Robert Port","What kind of net debt leverage are you expecting in 2017?","Matthew J. White","As you saw, for 2016 we had a slight reduction in net debt. Looking in 2017 we\u2019ll probably have a little more debt pay down as well so I\u2019d expect net debt to lower again. As far as the ratios, obviously, that will be a function of other parts of the income statement and balance sheet. But, I\u2019d expect ratios to improve and net debt to be a little lower by the end of \u201917.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Harrison - Seaport Global Securities.","Michael Harrison","Steve, in terms of a new project announcement with Marathon, I know that\u2019s on your pipeline network but it sounds like there\u2019s also going to be a new SMR added to help serve that customer. Can you provide any additional details on the capital requirements there and the scale of that project?","Stephen F. Angel ","That project happened to be a case where we have sufficient SMR capacity on the pipeline system to supply that so that\u2019s not an example of one where we\u2019re going to be building a new SMR. There is some investment pipelines and so forth, but it\u2019s not an SMR based investment for that project. ","Michael Harrison","I was also hoping you could comment on the refinery turnaround activity that you talked about hitting North America sequentially. Was there a negative year-on-year impact on revenue? Can you talk a little bit about how spot hydrogen volumes looked year-on-year in North America? Also, did you have any maintenance headwind year-on-year related to the hydrogen business?","Q - SS","In the fourth quarter we had several major customers go through turnarounds and as a result our hydrogen volumes were lower. In Q4 we did benefit some spot business as that was required in Q4. But, going into Q1 it looks like all of our major refineries plan on running very hard. Capacity utilization is something on the order of 96% is what is expected and refinery margins are quite healthy so I think Q1 will continue to be a situation where everybody is running full out.","Operator","Your next question comes from PJ Juvekar - Citigroup. ","PJ Juvekar","Steve, you talked the chemical [inaudible] from the Gulf Coast as a bright spot. The first wave of those plans is coming online pretty soon, what would you say is your market share in terms of the number of volumes in the Gulf Coast?","Stephen F. Angel ","As I\u2019m looking at the investments that we\u2019re making, and you saw it the deck on page five. These are projects that we are executing and projects that are all in our backlog today firmly under contract. We have other projects that we\u2019re working on as well. Quite frankly, in terms of trying to calculate a market share by a molecule, I don\u2019t spend a lot of time doing that. I do look at our competitive position and I look at any gaps I think we might have that need to be addressed. ","We certainly make sure that where we have strengths, where we have the infrastructure in place, where we have the flexibility and the reliability and the cost position to capitalize on certain business opportunity along the US Gulf Coast, we make sure that we do that. I think probably the more important statistic is the one I gave in my opening comments where I said that if you look at the system that we show here today on page five, that four years from now that system will be 50% larger, probably a little more, but 50% larger than it is today. That shows you the growth potential that is there and that will be quite significant for us.","PJ Juvekar","In your strategy you mentioned that you want to improve the resilient end markets like Co2. What would be the end market? Is there a goal for this to become a certain percentage of the company?","Stephen F. Angel ","I said I want resilient markets to reach about a third of our total sales. That is the goal and then of course, I listed five or six markets that I consider resilient end markets. Co2 happens to be a product that you need to have to be able to participate in food markets, in beverage markets and so that is why part of the focus in growing our resilient end markets is to make sure that we have the right Co2 sources, the quality of Co2 sources, where we need them on a regional basis so we can go penetrate dry ice markets or expand our new Co2 business model and other markets like that.","Operator","Your next question comes from James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. ","James Sheehan","Could you comment on your M&A pipeline in packaged gases? Has the way you look at acquisitions in that market changed given the discussions with Linde?","Stephen F. Angel ","Linde doesn\u2019t have a substantial packaged gas business, I\u2019ll say, in the United States today, at least with respect to welding\/cutting gases and the like so that really has no bearing. But to the basis of your question, the pipeline is pretty much what it has been. As I look at it I think some of the prices for some of these properties has moved up to a point where I\u2019m less interested than we\u2019ve been. A lot of this is going to be a function of are these bolt on type acquisitions where we can really extract some pretty quick synergies?","But, I would say the pipeline itself has pretty much been steady. It\u2019s a lot of small things. But, as I look at it I think some of the price levels have moved up a point of disinterest for me.","James Sheehan","Can you breakout what your Canada and Mexico volumes were like in the fourth quarter?","Matthew J. White","Ex oil well, hold that off to the side because obviously we had pretty substantial businesses both in Canada and Mexico that are down 80% plus in some areas. We\u2019ve seen some good packaged volumes in Canada actually, noticeably better in the US especially in the eastern side of the country you\u2019re getting some good activity there whether it\u2019s auto, even the food business, and some of the things we\u2019re doing, some construction. I\u2019d say Canada has been fairly good.","Mexico ex oil well continues to do well as well. We\u2019re seeing kind of mid-single digit type growth rates in both of those countries ex the oil well impact. I think that\u2019s been fairly good.","James Sheehan","With your backlog ticking up a little bit here, I was just wondering if you could comment on what you think your cap ex is going to look like over the next two years? Do you think it stays in the flat kind of range, or do you see any major changes upward or downward?","Stephen F. Angel ","I would say that the guidance we gave was $1.4 billion for 2017. As I look at the timing of projects and project spend I think that number will probably move down somewhat in \u201918 and probably \u201919 as well. Keep in mind, I\u2019ve said a lot of activity in the US Gulf Coast, a lot of spending in the US Gulf Coast, but projects in other parts of the world are winding up. This Northwest project in Western Canada will be starting up towards the end of this year. This project with a major oil refinery in China winding up this year and I don\u2019t see those projects being replaced. Again, the activity will be concentrated in the US. But given that, I think the spend rate will probably moderate down somewhat in the next two years.","Operator","Your last question comes from Emily Wagner - Susquehanna. ","Emily Wagner","In a prior presentation on January 11th you guys made to your employees regarding the Linde merger, you said the ability to continue to optimize the standalone business further is limited. We were just wondering if that means there is limited opportunity to increase Praxair margins without economic or currency improvement? Is the ability to improve margins capped right now?","Stephen F. Angel ","You have to keep in mind who was the audience? The audience for that is our employees. We have gone through two restructurings in the last two years and then probably three out of the last four so that\u2019s not an audience that I wanted to convey that we had more restructuring type opportunities ahead of us and that\u2019s one way to optimize a business. But, that to me is more making sure that we have our cost structure aligned with the market realities. ","The other ways to optimize a business working on pricing and working capital and ongoing productivity, making sure we\u2019re taking advantage of new sources of productivity like digitalization and advanced analytics, autonomous, semiautonomous vehicles, those are all areas that we can continue to optimize the business going forward. But, I just urge you to keep in mind the audience that I was speaking to.","Juan Pelaez ","Thank you again for participating in our fourth quarter earnings call.

Please proceed.","Kelcey E. Hoyt","Thanks, Deric. Good morning, and thank you for attending our second quarter earnings call and webcast. I'm joined this morning by Matt White, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Liz Hirsch our Vice President and Controller.","Today\u2019s presentation materials are available on the website at praxair.com in the investor\u2019s section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slide and note it applies to all statements made during this teleconference.","In addition, please note that full-year, year-over-year guidance comparison include adjustments in 2013 and the reconciliation to the U.S. GAAP reported numbers on the appendix to this presentation in press release. Matt and I will now review Praxair\u2019s second quarter results including the current business environment, and updated earnings guidance. At the end of the prepared remarks, we will be available to answer questions but in the interest of time and others waiting in the queue. Please limit you question to just one with a quick follow-up in the end.","Matthew White","Thank you Kelcey and good morning everyone. Praxair had a solid second quarter and once again delivered strong operating leverage down the income statement. Excluding negative foreign currency translation impact, sales grew 5% and operating profit grew 7%. We achieve these results despite challenging conditions in our Mexican and Brazilian businesses. Growth trends continuing to improve across other key geographies, including the U.S. By maintaining price and cost discipline, we grew operating margins and held our industry leading return on capital. All these efforts resulted in a very strong operating cash flow at 27% of sales.","Please now turn to slide number 3 for our consolidated results. Sales for the quarter were $3.1 billion dollars, an organic growth of 4% came primarily from price execution across all operating segments and higher volumes from new planned startups in North America and Asia. Baseline growth in North America, Europe and Asia was offset mostly by volume contractions in Brazil and energy customers in Mexico.","Acquisitions contributed 1% growth primarily in North America and Europe. Sequentially, sales grew 2% ex currency. From higher volumes in North America Europe and Asia partially offset by weaker volumes in Latin America.","EBITDA was $1 billion. An operating profit was $697 million. Both 5% above the prior year quarter. Excluding currency, operating profit growth of 7% which is driven by higher price, productivity gains and fixed cost management. The EBITDA and operating margins were strong at 32.1% and 22.4% respectively. Net income of $467 million grew 5% from the prior year in line with operating profit growth. Our key leverage metrics slightly improved from last quarter with the debt to capital ratio at 54.5% and the debt to EBITDA ratio at 2.3 times. Earnings per share of a $1.58 with 6% above the prior year and grew faster than net income due to 1% reduction in the number of diluted share outstanding as a result of net repurchases of common stock.","Casual from operations was a very strong $847 million. This funded $425 million of capital expenditures and acquisitions to support growth. $190 million of dividends and $140 million of stock purchases net of issuances. This aligns with our capital allocation strategy. A funding growth and shareholder returns from operating cash flow.","Our after tax return on capital this quarter was 12.6% in line with the first quarter. We expect return on capital to improve towards the end of 2014. As earnings grow faster than the capital base. For the quarter, our return on equity was 28.3%. Our project backlog which we defined as projects with CapEx greater than $5 million and associate with a fully executed customer supply contract remains solid at $1.9 billion and is comprised of 28 projects.","During the quarter, we started plants in Asia and North America and signed the new long-term contract for an on-site plant located in China. Our project backlog is well diversified across all geographies and end markets. Serving a balanced set of high quality customers in the energy, chemical, manufacturing, electronics and metals industries.","I addition to these projects we are developing new opportunities to feel growth. Especially in more active regions such as Asia and the U.S. Gulf Coast. While many opportunities exist, we are being selective on our bidding to ensure we achieve an attractive return for the risk and that we meet our discipline investment criteria in the core geographies. We are not capital constrained but we will remain prudent on how we allocate our capital.","And mow Kelcey will take you through the segment results.","Kelcey E. Hoyt","Thanks Matt. Please turn to slide 4 for our results in North America. Sales in North America were $1.6 billion, 5% above the prior quarter and up 7% excluding negative currency translation. Higher onsite volumes from hydrogen project start-ups supplying refinery customers and higher pricing drove organic sales growth of 5%. Acquisitions, primarily U.S. packaged gas distributors contributed 1% growth.","Higher cost pass-through, largely higher natural gas prices pass through the hydrogen customers increase sales by 1%. Sequentially, organic sales increase 4% driven by overall volume growth in the United States and Canada, partially offset by lower oil well services volumes in Mexico. U.S. merchant volumes grew at low single digit rate year-over-year and a mid-single digit rate sequentially with growth across most end markets.","Sequentially, Canadian merchant volumes were positive ex-liquid nitrogen for packing which were seasonally lower during the second quarter consistent with the spring. This quarter we saw significant softness in our Mexican oil well services businesses. As our key customer Pemex has limited production at certain fields due to the budget constraints and uncertainty regarding the secondary laws of the energy reform.","Volumes to old well services customers declined double digit percentages year-over-year and sequentially. Excluding the energy market impact, organic sales to other Mexican end markets such as manufacturing have performed well. U.S. package Gas\u2019 organic sales grew by 5% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Acquisitions contributed 3% growth year-over-year and 2% sequentially to the U.S. package gas business.","Second quarter growth continue to be driven by gas and rent which were mid single digits year-over-year while hard goods were steady. However, as the quarter progressed, the trends improved steadily such that during May and June, hard goods growth turned positive year-over-year for the first time in more than a year.","The organic U.S. package gas growth came from customers and transportations including rail, metal fabrication, energy, chemicals, health services, universities and manufacturing. Sales to construction customers stabilized while large equipment and machinery remained weak.","The North American operating profit was $398 million, 4% above the prior quarter and up 6% excluding negative currency translation impact. The increase was primarily driven by higher pricing and higher volumes. Operating process volumes in the U.S. and Canada was partially offset by the weaker volumes to Mexico energy customers.","(inaudible) operating margin was 24.4%. The higher cost passed through year-over-year primarily natural gas, increased sales with minimal impact on operating profits and reduced the operating margin percentage by 20 basis points year-over-year.","The price environment remains positive and they are obtaining traction on our recent price announcements. During the quarter we started up 5000 tons per day plant serving Deacero in northern Mexican steel company. The state of the art energy efficient plant increases Praxair\u2019s product capacity and distribution density across the Northern Mexico. Under a long term contract Praxair is supplying oxygen to and Deacero (inaudible) in Northern Mexico which produces more than one million tons of steel annually.","The additional supply also enables Praxair to meet growing demands regionally. For gases and liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon, primarily in the metal production, metal fabrication, glass and automated markets.","Proposal activity for new on-site plants in North America remain solid and the chemicals and energy markets located primarily in the Gulf Coast region as well as smaller on-site plants for manufacturing.","Now please turn to Page 5 for our results in Europe. Sales in Europe were 7% above the prior quarter and grew 4% excluding currency in cost pass-through. Acquisitions contributed 3% primarily delay in technology gases and industrial gas company that serves the global off-shore oil and gas industry which we acquired in May of last year. Organic sales were 1% above the prior year quarter due to price attainments. Volumes were steady year-over-year as modest volume growth in Northern Europe and Russia with mostly offset by greater days impact in Southern Europe from Easter.","Overall volumes have stabilized in our European business and we are encouraged to see pockets of modest growth. This will allow us to continue to obtain strong operating leverage from existing assets.","Sequentially, organic sales increased 3% on higher price of 1% and stronger volumes of 2%. Sequential volume growth was primarily based in Northern Europe and driven by energy and metals markets. Operating profit of $78 million with up 8% for the second quarter excluding foreign currency impact. Acquisitions contributed 3% growth. Higher pricing and volume increased operating profit by 9% continue to demonstrate strong operating leverage even at steady volumes. New project activities improving in Northern Europe with opportunities to expand existing pipeline supply and further build density, as well as opportunities for small on-site plants for manufacturing customers.","Page 6 shows our result in South America. South American segment sales are $509 million, 3% above the prior-year quarter excluding negative currency translation impact of 8%. Organic sales grew 2% as higher pricing was partially offset by lower volumes in Brazil and we\u2019re steady sequentially.","The estimated industrial production decline of 4% for the second quarter was more negative than expected. Even factoring in the World Cup Holiday impact. The end market volumes to metals and chemicals were weaker year-over-year and sequentially. However, this was partially offset by volume growth to healthcare, propane paper and glass customers.","Within the South American segment, about 20% of sales come from 8countires outside of Brazil. Volumes in these regions were up 7% year-over-year driven by food and beverage, healthcare and metals.","Operating profit in South America increased 1% excluding currency effects as higher pricing was partially offset by weaker volumes in Brazil and cost inflation.","Our expectations for the second half of the year in Brazil are for currency translation effects to be stable year-over-year with little impact at current rate. However, the presidential election in fourth quarter to create further currency volatility and now that the World Cup is over, we expect to see our package and merchant businesses rebound modestly in the third quarter. In addition, we continue to find new customers with application technologies.","Consensus IP is currently forecast at negative 0.9% for the full year in Brazil which implies flat to slightly negative volumes for the back half of the year. The business has and will continue to take actions as needed to adjust the changing economic conditions including cost reductions and continued discipline and execution of price and productivity program.","Please turn to slide 7 for our results in Asia. Sales of $394 million grew 6% from the prior year quarter excluding negative currency impacts and lower cost pass through. Volume growth of 5% was primarily driven by new project start-up in India, China and Korea. Merchant volumes grew 4% year-over-year. By end market the strongest sales came from metals and energy.","Sequentially volume decrease 1% as underlying growth in China, India and Thailand was mitigated by prior quarter's spot sales and chemical customer outages in China. Price contributed to 1% increase in sales and was primarily due to helium and specialty gases.","Asia\u2019s operating profit of $76 million increased 25% in the prior year quarter due to the impact of higher volume and pricing. During the quarter, we started up supply to a glass customer in Korea via pipeline from an existing air separation plant. In addition, we recently announced a new on site project for our 900 tonne plant to supply chemical customer under a long term contract that is expected to start-up in 2016 and will build our presence in the chemical part in East China.","Looking forward, on-site project bidding activity in Asia includes energy, metals, electronics, chemical and smaller on-site plants from environmental benefit such as waste water treatment and the manufacturing end markets.","Our results for Surface Technologies are shown on page 8. Surface Technologies sales for the quarter were $174 million, organic sales growth of 4% primarily due to higher pricing. Volume for steady as commercial aviation growth was offset by weaker industrial gas industrial coatings. Operating profit of $32 million increased 3% on higher pricing. And now I will turn the call back to Matt to discuss our updated earnings guidance.","Matthew White","Please turn to slide 9. Our earnings guidance for the third quarter is for EPS in the range of $1.58 to $1.65 which represents 5% to 9% growth year-over-year. We expect sequential growth to come from continued improvement in the United States on-site merchant and package gas volumes.","In Latin America, we are expecting moderate recovery in Mexico oil well service volumes and Brazil. The third quarter is always seasonally weaker in Europe with the summer holiday and we expect underlying Asia to perform consistent with the second quarter. We are updating estimated full year 2014 EPS guidance to a range of $6.30 to $6.45 representing 6% to 9% year-over-year growth. This includes approximately 2% negative currency translation. Therefore this guidance results in 8% to 11% year-over-year EPS growth excluding foreign currency impact.","We have taken the top end of the guidance down the nickel but let the bottom unchanged. This is the function of the current environment in the Mexican energy market and Brazil. Well we believe these are both cyclical challenges they will take time to fully recover. Despite this, we are confident in our ability to manage the aspects of the business that are under our control.","We have been executing all year on our key initiatives of growth, operating profit leverage, strong cash flow generation, and capital discipline. We have acquired several core industrial gas tuck-in acquisitions including five U.S. package gas distributors, four ownership of our U.S. mid-Atlantic joint venture, and Messer\u2019s Italian business. Year-to-date we have expanded the operating margin by 50 basis points to our relentless focus on price and productivity and generated operating cash flow of 23% of sales. This operate show excellence is what drives our consistent industry leadership and operating margins and return on capital. With that I would like to now turn the call over to Q&A.","Question-And-Answer-Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will be from line of David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. ","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Thank you. Good morning. Matt just on Brazil has your longer term view of the underlying growth in that country come down over last year or two given whats happened down there?","Matthew White","No David. We still feel good about the long-term prospects in Brazil. You look at country like Brazil they have today and will have a wealth of natural resources. And there is still significant infrastructure opportunities as you have a growing middle class and the increase of the wealth. And I think those sort of structural aspects are still there. Right now what you have got going on is you got some challenges with this quarter we had negative 4% IP growth and when you look across the quarter, April and May were pretty much in line with what we expected and we are pretty consistent with what we saw in the first quarter. But June was very challenging. So the primary poor performance rest this quarter was really around June and as we have come into July here, the first couple of weeks were also little soft and we have been picking up in the back half now as we have kind of got into World Cup. So it remains to be seen but we are expecting some sequential recovery here and the elections will be a big impact here in the fourth quarter depending on who wins and what direction it goes at least for the near term.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And Matt just quickly as a backlog keeps on creeping down, are you seeing any increase competitive intensity in bidding for projects either globally or in chives specifically? There is ultimately backlog coming off little bit here.","Matthew White","I don't think anything is changed that significant from what we have been saying over the last few years. I think there are a lot of opportunities out there but we continued to be disciplined in terms of what we want to go after. What you are seeing and I think we have been seeing is decisions to just taking longer for our customer base. You look at places like the Gulf Coast while things will be built and there will be more projects announced, there is a high cost of construction and it just takes time to get permitting in the front engineering done in the approval and think in Asia you are seeing, especially in China, just a longer decision process given some of the approaches around the environmental, approaches around the capacity and that's just going to take longer before decision to make but at this point when I wouldn't characterize it as any significant change in competitive intensity.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question will be from line of Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Good morning, two questions. Can you sort of update your thinking around pricing dynamics in the US in the merchant business and possibility for that market to tighten? Secondly, on the M&A pipeline, can you characterize what the opportunity set looks like in three areas, in coatings, in regional asset swaps, and (inaudible) in the US?","Matthew White","Okay. So first on the merchant. I think in the US the pricing environment is good. For North America we have shown 1% price but when you look specifically in the US, in merchant package we are seeing low-to-mid single digit pricing that we are achieving. And that's for the merchant package. So on-site, the escalation is not part of price. So that will affect the dynamic on the equation. So US overall I think is good. And capacity utilization in the US is creeping up a bit. We are running at 80 for a while I will say we are low 80s now. So I think those going well, for the US overall merchant market. Regarding the M&A side, it think I guess the taking order here you know coding for us that's not really a core part of our business. We run it well but something that will continue to run well but at this point we are not looking for a whole lot of M&A activity in the coating side. Packaged gas is consistent with what we have said before. There is still specially in the US a large contingency of independent distributors out there and we are the ones that makes sense in the regions that we are in. we will continue to pursue those acquisitions where it makes sense. And we need to get the synergies and justified honest synergies before we would go ahead and make that acquisition. But we have as you know many ways to enter into market other than just acquisitions in our packaged business. So I think it still looks good. As you have seen we have continued to roll up acquisitions we are also seeing small package acquisition opportunities in places like Europe and South America as well. So those will continue. I think on the swaps, that's something we are still actively interested in. so we are continuing working with other potential parties to look for swap opportunities. Its just something that we need that other willing party to be able to accomplish.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will be from the line of James Sheehan from SunTrust.","James Sheehan \u2013 SunTrust","","Good morning. I was just wondering if you could comment on the 2015 potential impact from earnings from new plant startups, given your outlook on the backlog coming down a little bit, do you think that the earnings impacts will be higher or lower next year than it was in 2014?","Matthew White","I think at this point still in the same range we have set. We have laid out for kind of 2015, 2016, 2017 anywhere in the $0.20 to $0.30 EPS impact from projects. Clearly that will sort of move up or down depending on timing when the project start-up and also if we add what I will call shorter term projects today that could go up in the end of \u201916 but right now we still feel good about the $0.20 to $0.30 and we still feel good in the 3% to 4% range on top line growth going forward. So no change at this point and as you know in the current backlog we just happen to have more project start-up than we added in this quarter but this can change by few hundred million dollars each quarter depending upon what we have signed and what we start-up. ","James Sheehan - SunTrust","Thank you and also thanks for the color on Brazil and your expectations in the second half. On a related note, geopolitical events in Russia are changing the situation in that region. Just wondering how your three- to five-year outlook is changing there and are any of your projects that are under consideration now, have you officially postponed the timeline for any of those?","Matthew White","So I think first on the 3 to 5 year outlook when we entered Russia there was a lot of very strong secular drivers in Russia that were attractive. A couple of the key ones were that resources, they have some of the lowest cost producers and things like steel in the world. In addition there are some very old inefficient air suppression units that they decades that need replacement and that are looking to be what we call decaped where the customers looking for industrial gas partner to come in build the new one and own and operate it. All those secular drivers still exists. So from that perspective we still firmly believe in our outlook and we haven\u2019t really wavered too much on that. Regarding the risk, we knew going in Russia would-- there would be risks. So as I mentioned in prior calls, we have taken a lot of mitigating steps, contractual protection, we are taking protection from the ruble and those are all playing out today. So as far as what we are seeing on the ground now, based on some of the recent events, initially the impact us has been slightly positive because with the border Ukraine shut down, you are not getting import of product from Ukraine and we don't operate in Ukraine. But what that does is it puts more demand on local Russian product. So that's. So that's actually been some upside for us. In addition, the power has gone up in Russia which makes the efficiency of the ASUS even more important for our customer base. So that is also created a greater demand for higher efficient ASUs. So from that aspect, I think they have been slightly positive and we haven\u2019t seen much of change on the ground with our interaction with our Russian customers. I think if anything what could happen you could get inflation, you could get recessionary conditions, there is sanctions were to become severe. But I don't think that would be drastically different than what you could see in other geographies with either stagflation or recession. So we do have inflation protection on our contract. So we have done something upfront to try and mitigate this but clearly we are being more cautious. We are being more selective and we will just continue to scrutinize any incremental investments there but it's not a big piece of our portfolio at this point.","","James Sheehan - SunTrust","Thanks a lot Matthew.","","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs.","","Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs","Good morning guys.","Kelcey Hoyt","Morning.","Matthew White","How are you?","Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs","Good. One question I had when I look at your incremental margins in Asia they are terrific. In Europe they are quite strong but in the US there really wasn\u2019t a lot of incremental lift. I am wondering if you can talk about why that occurred and then maybe what we should expect in the future?","Matthew White","Yes. So you are referring to year-over-year or sequential?","Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs","That's right, year-over-year. I think in the US there is sort of flattish even down a little bit in Asia they were up dramatically and up \u2013","","Matthew White","Yes. So the North American basis, a couple of key drivers, first natural gas is higher. So while that's just the past they are component it's raising our top line and I talk about 10% to 15% so that's a headwind about 20 basis points on our margins year-over-year. In addition, as you know we started up our HyCO assets from last year to this year that was a big driver of our project growth and HyCO on a IRI basis, while it's fairly consistent with what we expect on our ASUS investment it tends to be lower margin base because it's more of a pass-through component of energy than what we have in the ASUS. So just the mix effect that is also reduce the margins a bit. And then finally with this significant impact to our Mexican oil and gas service business that is down double digit sequentially and year-over-year and that tends to be a bit higher margin. So with that loss that's a little bit diluted as well. So those are kind of the three big drivers I would say, two out of three are just structural in terms of how the pass-through of energy works and the third one is a mix issue for us.","Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs","Matt, can you help me out on your hydrogen business, how much of that is -- do you carry the gas cost in your revenue line versus just the customer buying the gas? Then, secondly, could you size what the spot sales of hydrogen are? Should we view those as a one-off opportunistic sale? Is it something that should be more recurring given that you've got that flexibility?","Matthew White","Okay. So I think the first question, we are probably still more than half has energy pass-through in HyCO, all of the ones we have recently started up in the gulf have energy pass-through. We do have a few that are to your point pure tolling arrangements where the customer manages the methane or natural gas and we simply paid a tolling fee to operate the asset. So I would say the ones that have been starting up they have been energy pass-through and it still is more than half of our hydrogen assets have that component. As far as the spot sales, we do actually get that consistently. What we tend to see though is bigger spikes either when other sources of hydrogen are down, we can get spot opportunities when either out customers or other users of hydrogen that may not be our customers are having a larger need due to their production slate, we can get spot opportunities to sales. So we leverage not just our network but our cavern to be able to deliver the instantaneous pressure, quality and quantity that they need and that is something that\u2019s the function of our own going which is happening to see larger sales in some quarters than other based on both our customers and other industries need at that time.","Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs","Got it, that's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will be from the line of Duffy Fischer from Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays","Good morning. I was wondering if you could breakout a little bit the very nice margin improvement you saw in Asia maybe between how much of that was self help stuff, how much of that was just the market getting better and how much of that was maybe mix effect from new business.","Matthew White","Well I think first it's about probably $4 million that was related to insurance you see that about two years ago we had some outages and some excess cost and we were able to recover it. So that's a little bit of it. But the reminder of it is couple key things, pricing well pricing is challenging in Asia. We have been able to achieve some pricing on both helium and some of the rare gases and the specialty gases. In addition, we have been making a very concerted effort to move our merchant business more direct. So we are picking up some favorable mix which is helping the margin. It may cost us a little on the top line growth but as you can see from this operating leverage it is worth it. So I think that also is a fairly significant part and we are just trying to be more tight on cost and productivity. We have had a very renewed effort in Asia to manage the cost and productivity. So I would say at this point it's kind of equally distributed among those things with the efforts that we are undertaking.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then how would you look at helium effecting your business kind of first half of the year versus second half of the year? Do you think there have been meaningful moves there?","Matthew White","Well, there is clearly being some capacity that come on stream. You have Qatar 2 which is now running really an excess of nameplate capacity. You have had some additional sources come on. So I think that stabilized the market. You are seeing less and less shortages or outages and I think for the most part the helium contingency and allocations have ended. So the balance is a little better now. Now going forward, you still have the uncertainty around both the Algerian and Qatar trends as they go up and down that could change the dynamics also the BLM the Bureau of Land Management, with the Hugoton fields depending upon what they take out of the dome and helium and the depletion of that will also impact it. So I think well now it's fairly stable. It is something that can move up or down all based on the supply situation.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. Thanks guys. ","Operator","Your next question will be from the line of Donald Carson of Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial ","Matt, you have got a competitor with a new CEO who is kind of signaling that they are going to be more capital and bump up hurdle rates as they look at bidding on new projects. What impact, if any, do you think that has on your business? Has that been an issue in the past where -- I know you have been disciplined. Has that caused you to walk away from a lot of projects that others have been more aggressive on?","Matthew White","Well, I can't comment specifically on the competitor. I think in general, any time competitors become more discipline that's a good thing for the industry. As far as reactions or interactions in past projects, I think you have seen some of our competitors pursue other avenues of investment that we simply haven\u2019t. So clearly there, there is no competitive impact us because we are simply not in those geographies or not serving those markets. But in general it should be positive for the industry and thus positive for us as participant in that industry. ","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial ","And j ust a follow-up on the tone of business in the US, Kelcey talked about hardgoods turning positive in May and June for the first positive year-over-year comparisons in some time. Is this just a catch up from the weather issues in the first quarter or is this symptomatic of. of a turn in business and did you see a pickup in your merchant volumes in June as well?","Matthew White","Yes, we have seen a pickup in merchant volumes and when you look at a business like PDI, although weather could impact it, they can recover much quicker, right? They have the ability that the customers we supply can work weekends, they can work other hours. They tend not to be 24x7 operations. So I don't think the weather impact in our package business was that significant and what impact that had was fairly quickly made up in the first quarter. So when I look at the trends we have seen and I think they are a positive underlying direction. When Kelcey talked about the markets we\u2019re seeing improvements in, it\u2019s virtually across almost every end market with the exception of heavy machinery and some of the mining type industries. So we are seeing some broad-based improvements, we are seeing improvements in the consumables of the hard goods and equipment while it\u2019s lumpy we\u2019re still seeing customers interested in buying large automation equipment. ","So I think the trend has been good. We will see if it continues but we\u2019ve been fairly pleased with the performance of that that business. ","Operator","Your next question will be from the line of Vincent Andrews, Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Matt, if I heard your commentary correctly on the merchant business, it sounds like your utilization rates may be in excess of the industry average. If that's the case, can you talk about whether you think that trend continues or if that sort of economic growth picks up that you might see some sort of deceleration in your utilization growth relative to what the industry might do? ","Matthew White","Well, I think when you look at \u2013 there is a couple of key things when you think about utilization. First, you obviously have inventory, you can manage for swings up and down but more importantly, second, you have the ability to convert liquid accounts to small on-site. So there always is an ability that if you grow beyond what that plant, the radius it serves you could either build a new liquid plant, you could truck other liquid from a farther plant away or you could put a small on-site there to replace that liquid and essentially delever or reduce the capacity of consumption of that plant. So there are lot of options. I'm not worried about hitting a capacity wall from any perspective and as you can imagine while we try to give you average numbers, it's very different across regions. And you see certain regions that are pushing in the mid-90s to high 90s and there are other parts and regions in the country that could be in the 70s or low 70s. So it is spotty in terms of what regions are stronger than others but we\u2019re not concerned about capacity; it\u2019s more just the management of your logistical costs and whether you want to have a liquid tank or whether you can supply with a small on-site gaseous form. ","Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. It's nothing related to sort of your strength in certain end markets relative to other end markets, it sounds more broad-based. Is that correct? ","Matthew White","Well I think it\u2019s broad based but one market that we have seen a recent improvement and has been the oil well service in the US. We've seen some significant pickup in that area for liquid nitrogen, so that has created a larger usage of that product. So that been a nice sort of pick up, I would say.","Operator","Your next question will be from the line of Mark Gulley, BGC. ","Mark Gulley \u2013 BGC Financial","You mentioned in the comments on Pemex, I would have thought that the reforms that they are doing in the hydrocarbon industry would be a long-term positive for companies like Praxair and yet the short term seems to be bumpy. Can you kind of resolve how long the short term pressure is going to last and whether or not my premise about long-term benefits is true?","Matthew White","Well, first, I do agree. I think mid to long term it is positive. I think in my view when you look at President Nieto came in toward the end of \u201812 and wanted to put in several reforms and sort of improve, if you want to call it the government involvement in Mexico. And so that we've seen is sort of industries that don't really have much of a government influence, and think automotive, manufacturing that tend to be export related have done quite well. And you can see that in the trends, in the industrial production trends. Industries that tend \u2013 that have a heavy-hand in Mexico like construction and oil and gas have been flat to soft. And I think part of it is some of the uncertainty around especially in the energy space, the secondary laws for the energy reform now, supposedly they will be sort of clarified here in the next few months. But in addition, there has been some budgetary constraints across a lot of government entities which has also created some social unrest in some of the localities. ","So the combination of those things I think are \u2013 I view it as sort of they\u2019re sacrificing maybe the short-term for the better outcome in the mid-and long-term. So we do believe it\u2019s positive. I do think these are cyclical issues in these government sponsored type industries but we continue to see very good strengths in automotive and manufacturing, it's just these other areas that are soft. So I think that it'll improve. Right now probably back end of this year and we still think \u201915 will be a good year. ","Mark Gulley \u2013 BGC Financial","And switching to PDI, it sounds like you are seeing a better pipeline of acquisition opportunity. Can you identify why you think things are loosening up a bit and then perhaps the transaction backlog will convert to deals? ","Matthew White","Well, you could imagine, we have a long list of potential deals that we\u2019ve been pursuing for many years. So we know they\u2019re mostly family-owned and operated, we know them quite well. We meet with them frequently. We supply them in a lot of cases. So we're just finding that that more families are willing to sell today. I think also what you saw \u2013 and you got to remember the timeframe, in the end of 2012 there was a big frontloading or an acceleration of acquisitions due to the tax law changes. So we saw, I would call an abnormally high amount of deals and then \u201913 was a bit dry because you pulled all those forward prior to tax law change. ","So now I would say we\u2019re getting back to what I\u2019d consider more of a normal run rate. So while it may feel like a step-up from what we saw in \u201913, I think it's fairly consistent with what we normally would see.","Operator","Your next question will be from the line of Michael Sison, KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Michael Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Nice quarter given the tough headwinds. In Brazil, it looks like there's roughly three major projects left in your backlog. Can you talk about maybe how bidding activity is there compared to the past and what you think needs to happen for that part of the business to improve longer term? ","Matthew White","So right now it\u2019s mostly small, small on-site, I\u2019d say the biggest things we\u2019re seeing are either improvement in more consumer driven industries, what we\u2019ll do small on-site or trying to make existing large on-site customers, think like steel, more competitive. Those are kind the main projects we are seeing today, so not a lot of big projects at this point. I think there are potential investments on the refining front, it remains to be seen whether or not those happen. That could be an area of future growth. But right now I think for that to change, I think there's going to be a lot of people that are just waiting on their investment cycle to determine what happens in the elections. ","Right now at least our opinion is if Dilma is reelected you may see a bit of a sell-off in the real and that\u2019s why we had mentioned we think there's some uncertainty in the real. And I think you might just see \u201815 as a continuation of kind of what we saw in \u201914. If there is a new candidate elected I think you will see some potential confidence just in the change itself that might improve some of the foreign investment. But regardless of who wins, they still have significant infrastructure needs for that country. So projects do have to happen, they just are expensive, there is high taxes, there is high labor content rules and I think some of the policies need to be eased to make it more competitive. Now the project we had with CSP they did ease some of those local content rules. Some of the refining projects that we\u2019re in the midst of looking at, they are looking at easing those local content rules. So I think there's some short-term measures they can take now to make projects more competitive by setting up free-trade zones, reducing the need for local content, reducing some of the tax burden, but longer-range they just need to improve the legislation and tax environment. ","Michael Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets","And then one quick one on Europe. It looks like that business is stable. Any thoughts there as you head into the second half of the year? Do you think that region has turned a corner?","Matthew White","Well, consistent to what we said last quarter, it\u2019s clearly stabilized in southern Europe. We\u2019re seeing some form of positive growth in price and volume and it's been quite stable which has been good. So from that perspective I\u2019d say yes, it\u2019s turned the corner in the fact that it is not declining, it\u2019s stable, it is more predictable. And with that I think we\u2019re very comfortable with our position there and our cost position there in terms of the capacity we have available and the margins we\u2019re able to achieve. Northern Europe, we\u2019re still seeing some good activity, not just Russia but some of the other Benelux areas and Scandinavia, investments in steel, investments in chemicals, investments in energy, so we\u2019re still seeing some customers there that want to be more efficient, more cost competitive and we\u2019re able to bring those solutions. So it's not growing at the same rate of let\u2019s say US Gulf Coast or Asia but we are seeing some modest growth. ","Operator","Your next question will be from the line of Mike Harrison, First Analysis.","Mike Harrison - First Analysis ","You mentioned that you are focusing a little bit more on trying to get some of the merchant business in China converted over to contractual customers rather than wholesale. How easy is that and I guess how -- what's the timing look like in terms of when we could see some improvement from that? ","Matthew White","From my perspective I guess there is a couple dynamics that will drive it, right? First is what\u2019s the availability of liquid, so you have not just industrial gas producers like us that have liquid capability but you also have some customer owned assets. So as long as liquid is available there it will create an opportunity for that distributor market to operate but if the country is serious about rationalizing steel assets, and if you do see some capacity that is shut in, that would be positive to help reduce that distributor market. I think from our perspective the things we can control, the key thing is showing the end customer the value and that comes with application technologies. A distributor is exactly what it says. They pick up product, they drop off product. That\u2019s all they do. ","For some customers, right now that might seem like something that works for them but as they find out from an efficiency standpoint, cost standpoint for them to be more competitive, they need someone to come in and help them on how to best utilize their gases, what blends of gases, where in their applications can they use things in certain equipment in delivery. So that is where we can bring that component and we can control and operate and maintain their tank system which from a distributor perspective they won\u2019t do that. And if your tank goes down in a lot of cases your customer goes down. And reliability is crucial. So if a distributor doesn\u2019t own their own gas supply and that supply goes down, then their customer goes down. ","So I think there is a lot of things from a liability, applications technology and then just the overall market as you see capacity sort of be reduced over time should all help this conversion and we have been seeing it. It\u2019s been \u2013 it\u2019s a long-range process we are doing but we're improving on it.","So I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Your next question will be from the line of P. J. Juvekar from Citi.","P. J. Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup","Matt, your chemical volumes were down 3%, possibly due to some turnarounds, but given the high utilization in the US, where do you see those volumes going? And what is your win rate in new plants as some of these projects go from feed into construction stage? ","Matthew White","So I think definitely we see that going up, and to your point that the reason it\u2019s down this quarter is more of some outages and turnarounds we had in some of our largest chemical customers and that\u2019s not just US, that was globally in some regions. But clearly it\u2019s an opportunity and that's something that we have a significant amount of our letters of intent sort of preengineering work right now underway, that is not in the backlog but that\u2019s something that would be future backlog. So we still feel very comfortable but for us what had to happen is this -- first phase had to play out first, which is more sort of the monetization of the olefins, whether they\u2019re taking methane and ethane and propane and basically putting crackers or de-hydrogenation units and those are not really that gas intensive but it is the next phase where we are seeing significant activity which is taking it further down the plastic stream into things like ethylene oxide or propylene, and also ammonia. So it\u2019s the next phases where we are seeing opportunities and we are in the bidding phases at this point.","P. J. Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup","Quickly last question, your India volumes are up 10%. I know there's a lot of excitement there with the new government, so when do you think that would translate into new business for you? ","Matthew White","Well, at this point we\u2019ve actually had a lot of interesting projects we have been working toward in India, primarily in refining and steel space. And I think with the new government and some of the new confidence in the country, I hope that those investment decisions might accelerate. So at this point I feel fairly good about India and if Modi can deliver on the promises that they have laid out, I think that will bode well, and I think we can see some good growth there.","Kelcey Hoyt","","Okay.

My name is Miranda, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Kelcey Hoyt, Director of Investor Relations. You may proceed now.","Kelcey E. Hoyt","Thanks, Miranda. Good morning, and thank you for attending our fourth quarter earnings call and webcast. I'm joined this morning by Jim Sawyer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Liz Hirsch, our Vice President and Controller.","Today's presentation materials are available on our website at praxair.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference. Please also note that our discussion of earnings for the full year and fourth quarter, including year-over-year and sequential comparisons, excludes previously disclosed adjustments in the third quarter of 2012 and fourth quarter of 2011. These items are detailed and reconciled to the GAAP reported numbers in the appendices to this presentation and the press release. Jim and I will now review Praxair's full year and fourth quarter results as well as our outlook for 2013, including earnings guidance. We'll then be available to answer questions.","James S. Sawyer","Thank you, Kelcey, and good morning, everyone.","Praxair delivered solid results for the full year 2012. Strong growth in our North American businesses was offset by significant currency headwinds and recessionary economic conditions in Europe and Brazil, resulting in relatively stable sales but continuing earnings per share growth.","Excluding foreign currency and cost pass-through, full year sales grew 5%, operating profit 6% and EPS 8%. This demonstrates that we continue to get leverage down the income statement by growing operating profits faster than sales through strong productivity, gains and price. EPS grew more than operating profit because of our strong return on capital and operating cash flow, which provides for share repurchases. This is the hallmark of our leadership and commitment to solid execution, effective management of what we have under our control, particularly during times of challenging economic conditions.","Our results for the fourth quarter were mixed as we had warned and -- at the beginning of the quarter. I hate to refer to the fiscal cliff, but budget anxiety and deferral of capital spending resulting from poor business confidence was strongly evident in Europe, South America and the U.S. Demand for packaged gases, primarily from the metal fabrication and machinery industries, slowed markedly in December as customers took extended holiday shutdowns in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, Europe and particularly South America. These shutdowns have extended into January, and in Brazil and Asia will probably last into February due to the Carnival and Lunar New Year holidays. Consequently, we've issued rather uninspiring earnings guidance for the first quarter. By March, we expect packaged gases to resume the strong growth we've seen over the past several years.","On the bright side, our on-site and merchant customers maintained solid demand through the year end as production from efficient steel mills, chemical plants and refinery runs continued strong. Moreover, we're clearly seeing a strong rebound in China now that the new Communist Party has taken hold and some delays in decision making that we have seen in 2012 have ended. This augurs well for exporters to China, specifically American and German machinery as well as commodities from North and South America.","While we tend to be conservative and believe things only when we see them, I'm optimistic that the remainder of 2013, we'll get back on track.","Kelcey E. Hoyt","Thanks, Jim.","Please turn to Slide 3 for an overview of the 2012 full year results. As Jim commented earlier, Praxair delivered solid results in 2012. Overall, sales were comparable with the prior year, and full year organic growth of 4% and acquisition growth of 1% was offset by the impact of currency translation and natural gas pass-through. Our North America and Asia segments delivered strong volume growth during the year, which was largely offset by lower volumes in Europe and South America. By end market, energy, manufacturing and metals showed the strongest growth from the prior year.","Operating profit of $2.5 billion was 6% above 2011, excluding foreign currency. Operating margin improved 40 basis points to a record 22.3%.","During 2012, for the fourth year in a row, we achieved more than 6% savings in our cost stack through productivity. This amount was higher than our ongoing targeted 5% per year as the Praxair businesses accelerated initiatives during the year in production, procurement and distribution. Approximately 25% of our savings came from sustainable productivity initiatives, with the largest being energy efficiency improvement in our plant.","Our after-tax return on capital for the year was 13.9% and was suppressed by the large amount of projects we have under construction and, therefore, on our balance sheet but which have not yet started up and are not yet earning revenues.","Return on equity increased to 28.9%.","Please turn to Slide 4. We generated record operating cash flow of $2.8 billion for the year, which was equal to 25% of sales.","Capital spending for the year was $2.2 billion, about 20% above 2011. 2012's capital spend at about 20% of sales was a larger-than-typical amount as this increase was driven by our strong backlog and the number of projects that we expect to start up in 2013. In a typical year, we spend about 15% of sales on capital projects.","In 2012, we invested $280 million in acquisitions, primarily for 17 packaged gas distributors in North America and in the industrial gas business in Russia.","During 2012, we also purchased $459 million of stock, net of issuances. $1 billion remains available under the share repurchase program that was authorized in 2012. We paid dividends of $655 million, and this morning announced a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend for 2013, our 20th consecutive annual increase.","Our debt-to-capital ratio was 51.9%, and debt-to-EBITDA was 1.9x, reflecting our solid investment-grade credit rating.","During the course of 2012, we took advantage of low long-term interest rates as well as our tight issuance spreads to Treasury and issued 5-, 10- and 30-year bonds at record low yields. About 85% of our debt is now termed out with long-term securities.","Please turn to Slide 5 for our fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter sales were $2.8 billion, comparable to 2011. Strong growth in Asia and modest year-over-year growth in North America was offset by lower sales in South America and Europe. Sequentially, overall sales were modestly above the third quarter. Sequential sales growth in North America, Europe and Asia was mitigated by lower sales in South America as many customers lowered production over the holiday.","Operating profit was $616 million as compared to $619 million in the prior year quarter. Operating margin remained strong at 22%.","Net income was $414 million, in line with the prior year, and earnings per share was $1.38 versus $1.36 in the prior year quarter.","Fourth quarter operating cash flow was a record $879 million and funded $586 million of capital expenditures, acquisitions of $171 million and dividends and share repurchases.","Please turn to Page 6 for our results in North America. Sales in North America were $1.4 billion, 2% above the prior year quarter. Organic sales growth was steady as increased price of 2% was offset by similar volume declines. Acquisitions of packaged gas distributors, primarily in the United States, contributed 1% sales growth.","On-site sales were strong and grew year-over-year and sequentially, with the strongest growth to energy, metals and chemicals. Energy was driven by our on-site supply systems to refineries, the majority of which are in the Gulf Coast region of the United States.","Pipeline oxygen sales to steel mills were strong as our steel customers are now very cost competitive globally. The fundamentals for our North American chemical customers are strong as their production remains advantaged with plentiful low-cost natural gas as a feedstock.","Packaged gas sales were impacted at the end of the quarter by falling business confidence among our customers with metal fabrication and machine job shops.","North American operating profit was $367 million, 4% above the prior year quarter. The operating margin was a very strong 25.9%, reflecting pricing and productivity gains.","In 2013, we are on track to start the 2 large hydrogen projects under construction for Valero at St. Charles and Port Arthur and the hydrogen supply to serve Motiva in Louisiana. In addition, we have 1\/2 dozen air separation plants due to start up in North America in 2013 and 2014.","Proposal activity for new on-site plants in North America remained strong, particularly to the cost-advantaged chemical industry using natural gas as a feedstock. The list of potential chemical projects in the United States and, therefore, related opportunities for sale of gas continues to grow.","Now please turn to Page 7 for our results in Europe. Sales in Europe were 5% below the prior year quarter due primarily to the weaker euro. Packaged gas volumes continued to decline due to weakness in the metal fabrication and manufacturing markets. During the quarter, we also saw German volumes decline modestly as machinery production fell.","Operating profit of $60 million was 6% below the prior year, driven primarily by negative currency translation effects.","During the fourth quarter, we started up our first air separation plant in Russia. This plant will produce oxygen, nitrogen and compressed air for Kaustik, a division of Nikochem, under a long-term contract in Volgograd, an industrial region in southern Russia. The highly efficient plant with capacity of 350 tons per day replace older captive units and will reduce Kaustik's electricity consumption at the site by approximately 30%. The plant will also supply merchant products to local markets such as metals, metal fabrication, glass, automotive, food, electronics and health care.","Page 8 shows our results in South America. South American segment sales were $484 million; 9% below the prior year quarter due to negative currency impacts, primarily the weakening of the Brazilian reais against the U.S. dollar. Sequentially, lower volumes across on-site, merchant and packaged reduced sales by 7%.","During the fourth quarter, customers in Brazil extended holiday shutdown periods, accelerated maintenance and reduced inventories. This impacted most end markets with the largest decreases in manufacturing and metals customers, which represents about 55% of our sales.","About 20% of Praxair's sales in South America come from the countries outside of Brazil. Underlying sales in these countries grew 11% versus the prior year quarter and 2% sequentially with growth in chemicals, food and beverage, health care and manufacturing.","Operating profit in South America was $92 million versus $118 million in the prior year quarter.","We remain very positive on Brazil in the medium to long term, given the strong growth fundamentals in place and our 100 years of operating experience and strong position.","We continue to see strong new project proposal activity. Proposal activity is broad based across South America in Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Argentina and Chile, primarily in energy, manufacturing and metals.","Please turn to Slide 9 for our results in Asia. Sales of $374 million grew 12% versus the prior year quarter. Volume growth of 12% came primarily from higher on-site sales in China, India and Korea, including new plant start-ups for metals and chemicals customers. We continue to see lower demand from the electronics end market, including semiconductor, flat panel display and solar customers.","Asia's operating profit of $69 million increased 15% from the prior year quarter. Operating profit improved from higher volumes as well as productivity gains.","Our backlog of projects in Asia continues to be replenished by new signings as projects start up and currently includes 20 projects in China, India, Korea and the Middle East that will start up between the first quarter of this year and into 2015.","During the quarter, we started our third production plant to supply Usha Martin Limited, India's leading wire and wire rope manufacturer. The plant will supply gaseous oxygen and nitrogen to support Usha Martin's expansion.","We announced the signings of 2 projects that have been added to the backlog during the quarter, one in India and one in China. In India, we are expanding our supply of gaseous oxygens, nitrogen and argon to JSW's steel mill in southern India. Praxair's air separation unit has a production capacity of 1,800 tons per day and will add to the existing Praxair; supply of 6,800 tons per day currently. The plant will also supply merchant liquid to support growing demand in the region in the steel, cement, chemical, textile, pharmaceutical and automotive markets.","In China, we signed a long-term supply contract to expand supply to our existing customer, Jinlong Copper, in eastern China with an estimated start-up of mid-2014. We will invest to double the capacity of our air separation plant in Tongling to 700 tons per day. In addition, we will acquire Jinlong's existing captive plant. Jinlong has also been utilizing Praxair's oxy-fuel burner applications technology to further improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions.","New project activity for the region remains strong. We have not seen any weakening in the negotiation and bidding process for new project activity. In fact, in a couple of instances, given the government changeover, a couple of bids have accelerated with the customer indicating they plan to make a decision quickly. The growth continues to be driven by longer-term secular growth needs and includes energy, chemical, metals and manufacturing.","Our results for Surface Technologies are shown on Page 10. Surface Technologies's sales for the quarter were $162 million, up 3% compared to the prior year excluding currency. The underlying sales growth came primarily from higher price as increased energy and aerospace coatings were offset by weaker industrial coatings, primarily in Europe.","Operating costs was $28 million for the quarter, and the increase reflects price and productivity gains.","Now please turn to Page 11 for our earnings guidance. Our earnings guidance for the first quarter is for EPS of $1.35 to $1.40. Typically, our first quarter is the softest of the calendar year due to seasonal slowdowns due to holidays in South America and Asia and slow winter sales in the U.S. construction market.","Our guidance for the full year of 2013 is for sales to be in the area of $12 billion, roughly 7% above 2012.","Our initial forecast for full year earnings per share is a range of $5.85 to $6.10, which represents an increase of 5% to 10% above our 2012 earnings. This guidance assumes a currency headwind of about $0.04 a share at current rates from foreign currency translation, the majority of which would occur in the first quarter.","Pension has a headwind of about $0.05 per share for the year, given the lower discount rates in effect on the revaluation as well as loss amortization. Interest expense will increase due to higher debt levels that are now substantially termed out. This is estimated to be a headwind of about $0.05 per share.","We expect capital spending to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. About 20% of this spend is maintenance capital for our base business. We spend another 5% for cost reduction projects such as improving the energy efficiency of our plants by upgrading compression equipment or turbomachinery. We will typically look for a 3-year payback on these projects. The remaining 75% of our capital spend, or approximately $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, is for new production plants under contracts with customers, which will deliver sales and earnings growth for the foreseeable future.","With that, I would like to turn this call over to Q&A. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander, Jefferies.","Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","This is Rob Walker in for Laurence. I guess, Jim, can you go into a bit more detail on the rebound you're seeing in activity in China?","James S. Sawyer","Right. I think there you can see that in several areas. But the most important one in my mind is really the pace of decision making and the pace of moving forward on projects. And we saw generally during the second and third quarters of 2012 kind of a lot of pause in decision making as people were waiting for the party members to get chosen and so forth. That, in turn, slowed down capital spending, and now we've seen that improve. So we're seeing much quicker decision making in terms of new project proposals, and we're also seeing additional strengthening demand in merchant gases and on-site gases, particularly December and the first couple weeks of January.","Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then can you update us on where merchant utilization rates are by region and kind of how those -- whether they were up or not sequentially?","James S. Sawyer","We don't really go through them all by region, but I would tell you that utilization rates, generally speaking, are sequentially off. In Europe, they were lower. In the U.S., they're lower. And in Asia, I would say they're up slightly. But generally, they're not as strong as we would like them to be.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark R. Gulley , Equity Research  BGC Financial L.P.","Mark R. Gulley , Equity Research  BGC Financial L.P.","If I take a look at the backlog, guys, about $1 billion of the $2.6 billion is in Asia. Does it concern you, Jim, that, that backlog is a little unbalanced in terms of a risk assessment?","James S. Sawyer","Well, it's a big number. The -- and I would be concerned if it was all in one country, but it's pretty evenly split between Korea, India and China. There's also some projects in the Middle East and Thailand there. But we've got a large backlog in Korea, mostly related to 3 projects that we're building for Samsung right now in their core Korean operations, which, incidentally, have continued to operate very well because Samsung, there's a mix of their own in-house manufacturing as well as outsourced manufacturing. When their volumes go down, they fully outsource manufacturing back in-house, and that's actually improved our business as far as -- our electronics business held up quite well during the quarter. India, we've got a couple of steel projects, refinery projects and then a bunch of kind of variety of manufacturing and mining metals and so forth. So it's pretty well balanced there. Then in China, we've got a couple large gasification projects underway. We don't have anything new in steel underway. And so it's pretty well balanced. But it's a large amount of backlog for Asia. But that's absolutely where the growth is.","Mark R. Gulley , Equity Research  BGC Financial L.P.","Right. And then secondly, one of your competitors talked about a refinery hydrogen outage that they benefited from in the quarter. Was it you or another competitor that had some operating problems on the U.S. Gulf Coast?","James S. Sawyer","It certainly wasn't us. It might have been an in-house or refinery. I'm not sure what they're talking about.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar from Citigroup.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So your CapEx is up over 50% in the last 2 years. And if you look at it, I mean, you really don't have any free cash flow because of this high CapEx and your dividend payments. So when do shareholders begin to see free cash flow? Do we need to see loadings go up before we see that?","James S. Sawyer","That's a good question. But we are -- we really ended 2012 in a steep level of capital spending, almost 20% of sales. And that's because we had a lot of backlog that we -- pretty nearly finished construction in 2012 and will start up in 2013. CapEx in 2013 will be probably a range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion, more back down to the more like 15% of sales kind of number. And I expect that it will stay at those levels going forward. Now one of the problems we have is that we're just not performing very well this quarter. We're not operating on all cylinders. Our operating profit contribution in South America was $25 million lower than the prior year. It's about $100 million annualized. About 5% of our earnings per share disappeared with that. So we've got to get business in South America and Europe performing better. We've got to get these refinery projects, well, they'll be starting up for Valero and Motiva in the second quarter. And then the $1 billion of projects that Mark and I were talking about in Asia will be starting up in 2012 as well -- or 2013, I should say. But we clearly should be on track to be generating positive operating cash flow or stronger positive operating cash flow. But we will continue to increase the dividends and buy back stock because we also have an opportunity now, with very, very low interest rates, to take out a little bit more leverage and give our shareholders some of the benefit of our low borrowing cost.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And just quickly, I think you're guiding to EPS growth of 5% to 10% this year. Your project backlog, you say, will contribute 4% to 6% of that, and plus you're buying back stock. It feels like you're not much -- giving much credit to your base business. Are you being conservative on that growth target?","James S. Sawyer","Yes. I mean, if you look at our EPS guidance, the bottom of the range essentially assumes no new contribution out of the base business. So in other words, a completely flat base business in 2013. The pickup from $5.57 to $5.85, that $0.30 or so, is all coming from new projects, partially offset by about $0.10 of -- or maybe $0.05 of headwind from pension, another $0.05 from higher interest expense, another $0.05 from currency. So the bottom of the range is no growth in the base business, no improvement in the economy. And then I think the top end of the range shows -- look, I'm hoping to see beginning of March, which is a pickup in packaged gas demand in the U.S. and a pickup in some of the oil well services activity, pickup in South America and a pickup in Europe. So hopefully, we'll get up there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer of Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So the bullishness on Latin America, well founded medium and long term. Can you kind of talk about how long is the short term and what we should expect macro-wise for your business there over the next 2 to 3 to 4 quarters?","James S. Sawyer","I wish I knew. I've been wrong the last couple of quarters, but I think like Brazil has gone through kind of a 1, 2, 3, 4 punch, starting out with their own strong currency and high interest rates. That should have bounced back, but then I think they were hit in the middle of this year by weakening demand from China for raw materials, and then they've been hit in the fourth quarter by power rationing and decreased power availability. Now one of the things that we're expecting to happen in Brazil, well, there are quite a few government stimulus programs under way in terms of lower interest rates and taxes on imported goods. But they also have plans to reduce taxes on electric power. And that's one of the Achilles' heels for the Brazil producers right now, is that electric power in Brazil costs easily probably 2.5x what it cost in the United States. Those tariffs are supposed to come down in February, and I personally believe that one of the reasons that December and January were so weak is that people are waiting to have lower power costs to start up again. So we'll knock on wood and hope that we get into the second quarter and we'll get much better contribution out of Brazil.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then if we look to the U.S., you guys got a very interesting view of the big chemical build-out that people are talking about, both supplying some product to these big plants and also in that you've done a lot of construction yourselves in the U.S. where others really haven't over the last several years. When you think about kind of the announced build-out that people have talked about going out into 2017, '18 and 19, how probable is it that you think the chemical industry can build out on the schedule that it's projecting itself? And then what's your opportunity around that?","James S. Sawyer","Yes. There are some, roughly 10-or-so projects that I think are -- there's probably 20 projects or so on the drawing board, maybe 10 of which will end up getting built. I'm not going to start giving odds on particular projects right now. But I can tell you that the construction economics, construction scheduling, construction execution on the Gulf Coast is better than anywhere else in the world. We have consistently been able to build our projects on budget, on schedule. I can tell you that if you try to build a large chemical plant in the Gulf Coast as compared to Europe or South America, your capital spending is probably going to be half as much as other parts of the world. And that's because of high skilled labor availability, good labor productivity and so forth. So I think that the Gulf Coast is in good shape for -- these guys will be able to build these projects on budget and on schedule.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison, KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","In terms of Europe, in the beginning, it sounds like it's stabilizing a little bit, maybe steady, I guess, to some degree at weak levels, and the competitors over there were a little bit aggressive at the beginning of the downturn. Has things sort of normalized there, the competitive environment? It looks like pricing was positive or weighed back to a little bit more normal.","James S. Sawyer","Yes. Well, there's a lot of different parts of Europe. But I would say that Southern Europe, obviously, has been hit for multiple years now by the constant fiscal issues. Germany kind of was very strong for a couple years and then finally slowed down in the second half, and I would largely attribute that to less -- lower exports of machinery to China and other countries, which is kind of the same thing that I was talking about before. But what we're expecting in 2013 is definitely some improvement in Southern Europe. And that's mainly because the -- they -- during 2011 and 2012, the government spending has tightened up, and that was an additional fiscal drag on industrial production growth. And then now that's over. They've reached their targets. Spain's reached its targets, Italy reached its targets in terms of austerity. And so spending should be able to pick up a little bit in 2013. And I think that as China starts to pull [ph] a little more equipment and so forth, that Germany could get a lift also.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And one quick one on PDI. Is the expectation to potentially see that business get back to maybe mid-single digits in terms of growth? And do you still see acquisitions in that area in 2013 as a good way to use -- utilize your cash?","James S. Sawyer","Right. Well, we had kind of an open window in 2012 for acquisitions in the sense that most of these acquisitions, or pretty all of them, are family-owned businesses and, as I've said before, their decision to sell is usually a family decision. Now businesses were strong in 2012, and people were concerned about capital gains taxes going up. And so a lot of people came to us, and especially in the fourth quarter, ready to sell. And so we closed those acquisitions. I would expect that the pace of acquisitions will slow down because that kind of window is over. In terms of the underlying business, I think you've got some government contractors and so forth who are unsure what kind of inventories they should be carrying. So the biggest downturn that we've seen in December and January has been in hard goods and equipment spending, and I think that the U.S. industrial renaissance concept is still alive and well. We've talked about the refinery build-outs, sort of the chemical plant build-outs in the Gulf Coast. That should be -- augur well for welding [ph] and equipment spending, packaged gases and so forth. So I think they'll get back on track as the year progresses.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edward Yang from Oppenheimer.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just following up on Mike's question. Maybe provide some color around the North American volume dip. That was an area that was previously outperforming. And what do you think volumes will be up in North America in 2013?","James S. Sawyer","In packaged gases or generally speaking?","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Generally, including the new plant start-ups, Valero and Motiva.","James S. Sawyer","Oh. With the plant start-ups and so forth, our total volumes will be up probably close to 10%.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the decline in the fourth quarter, how was that spread out between the packaged gases? And you also mentioned merchant and frac-ing as well.","James S. Sawyer","Yes, most of that was in packaged gases. I think what I was trying to convey is that sometimes, we've seen year-end production curtailments with on-site customers. We did not see that in either the steel, the chemical or the refinery industry this year. So it was mostly packaged gas and manufacturing. We've seen some slowdown in natural gas frac-ing, and I'm not sure exactly when -- what to expect there.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And finally, do you have any onetime restructuring costs or any onetimers in any of the divisions related to cost containment?","James S. Sawyer","Yes. I mean, if you decide to take a closer look at our income statement, we typically have what we would call other income of $5 million to $10 million a quarter. It was negative this quarter, and we did have to -- we did take advantage of the quarter to take out some write-downs in South America. And we also have a fairly significant severance cost this quarter, as we do most quarters. And then the other thing that was hurting other income was slightly lower partnership income from our -- one of our frac-ing joint ventures. That was a dent in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson, Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Jim, I just want to get a little more color on your outlook. So you had 2% growth of -- in volume overall in '12, obviously down from '10 and '11. So what's behind your '13 outlook? Where do you see that volume going? And can you just be a little more specific on how PDI did in the fourth quarter between gases and rent and hard goods?","James S. Sawyer","Right. Well, let me start with PDI. And basically, PDI results for the quarter were relatively flat year-on-year. But the last -- December was down 7% in hard goods, for example. So basically, what we're seeing is volume's up overall in the fourth quarter, but really all in December, and still seeing the price achievement both in gases and rent. But hard goods is where we took a hit. Now the other question was about...","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","It is about your overall volume expectation of the company. So you're up 2%, which -- in '12, which really slowed down, I guess, from 5% in '11 and 9% in '10. So what's -- is it just kind of muddle along at that level? Or do you see any -- are you baking in any sort of volume -- significant volume recovery beyond what you saw in '12?","James S. Sawyer","Well, what I said about the guidance was that the bottom end of the guidance assumes really no contribution from underlying volumes in terms of industrial production pretty much globally. But the -- we should get roughly 6% from project start-ups across the year. And then we could potentially get back to 8%, 10% if we get some help from the economy.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Yes. And then on that 4% to 6% topline contribution from new projects, what does that translate into in terms of earnings per share?","James S. Sawyer","It would be slightly higher than that because the new projects have high operating margins. For the most part, they're on-site projects with high operating margins and will contribute more to operating profit than they do to sales.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews, Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Sure. Just one last follow-up on sort of what's baked in versus what's been happening in particular to packaged gas. I just want to make sure I understand the -- how much of the sort of December and I guess now January weakness just becomes loss versus how much of it do you think can snap back later in the year? And what's baked into that 5% to 10% EPS growth?","James S. Sawyer","So I think that the time loss is lost, okay? I know there were weak volumes in December and January. I don't think that we'll get a payback for those lines in February if that's the way the question is oriented. So I think that there's just -- I mean, I just don't think we'll see that come back. So that just put a dent in the last month of 2012 and the first month of 2013.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Manthey, Robert W. Baird.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just wondering, given that you've seen good results in terms of pricing in the face of a pretty lackluster demand environment, I'm just wondering, Jim, if you can talk about your outlook for 2013 pricing even if we do get a relatively flattish volume condition.","James S. Sawyer","Right. Well, I mean, we generally, historically, have gotten on average about 2% per year price in merchant and packaged business. Now that's all kind of a long-term average. Not a whole lot different than inflation, but a pretty good number when you compare it to generally what you see in other basic materials sectors where pricing tends to come down over time. So we're pretty positive about the outlook. We have contracts in merchant and packaged which enable us to pass on price increases. And certainly, what we have to do is to be able to get productivity and price increases which more than offset our inflation. And generally speaking, our team is able to do that. We have issues around the world like the smaller argon prices in China, which we were not able to recover, and then the weak economies in Europe and South America. But I think with a little bit of economic stability, we'll be able to get -- reach our goals in pricing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter, Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Jim, just tying your last answer to the Jan. 1 price increase of, I guess, 15% for Lox\/Lin and as much as 30% for helium. I know you don't get nearly all of it, and there is a -- it comes on a bit of a waterfall. But should this imply a little bit more than the annual 2%-type price increase, at least for North America?","James S. Sawyer","Right. Well, the way that pricing works in the merchant business is that most of the customers are on contracts probably an average of 5 years, and there are a variety of types of contracts depending on what the customer is interested in. But in a lot of cases, we've got some customers who are on old contracts that are 4 years old, I would say. They come up for renewal this year and haven't seen a price increase in maybe 5 years. And so the announcement that we've put out is really more focused on customers that are situated like that and is not meant that we would get that kind of a price increase across our system.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Understood. Just, Jim, one more thing. Just on the 17 North American packaged gas acquisitions, how much sales did you acquire? And what was the average EBITDA multiple you paid?","James S. Sawyer","In terms of prices of acquisitions?","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes.","James S. Sawyer","It really depends on the specific property. But we pretty much focused on acquisitions where we've already got existing operations and we can get some good synergies. So I would say generally kind of as a rule of thumb that we will be paying somewhere in the order of 10x EBITDA pre-synergy, and then after we've done the synergies, we'll get, after synergies, something like 6x EBITDA.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And how much sales did you acquire in those 17?","James S. Sawyer","Excuse me?","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","How much sales revenues did you acquire?","James S. Sawyer","Revenue, about $120 million.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Koort, Goldman Sachs.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Jim, you talked about the incremental earnings from your new projects. And I'm just curious, given a relatively somber outlook for the base business, do most of those projects, those on-sites, have piggybacks that would have a slower ramp to that extra liquid volume? Or is there any reason to expect that the ramps of these new projects would be slower than typical given a weaker economic environment?","James S. Sawyer","There is a fair amount of that. It depends on the projects. Some of the projects are -- especially the refinery hydrogen projects -- are 100% take or pay. Others of the projects have piggyback liquid credits for liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon. And usually, we try to be fairly conservative in our expectations for both the volume ramp-up and the price of new capacity there. I would say that one of the slower parts of 2012 where we didn't get as much contribution as we would have liked to was some of the Chinese projects where we had some liquid argon projects and, as we've talked before, the price of liquid argon came down significantly.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And on another sort of second gas -- second-tier gas is helium. And I guess I've seen different views on whether the helium supply issue is being resolved or not. And then we see some unrest in Algeria, which tends to be a good source or was expected to be a good source of extra helium. Are you guys running into problems in your PDI business with helium availability? And what's pricing doing there?","James S. Sawyer","Right. We have enough helium to go around to all of our customers at this point in time. But now, we don't have any more than that, okay? And so the -- there -- probably one of the issues with helium is there's only a few places in the world where helium is found, and that's usually found in conjunction with certain natural gas wells in the Midwest or -- and also in Russia and, interestingly, in Algeria. We don't source much from Algeria, so we're not really concerned about that issue. I don't think it'd be an issue anyway. But clearly, there are limitations on supply. We as well as others in the industry are trying to find some more sources of supply. We're quite well backward integrated, and so I think we have the most robust and flexible supply system as anybody in the industry, and that's why we're the only one who does not have people who are -- allocations are reduced at this point in time. But I think that supply will be tight through 2013, and the best way to allocate that is to try to keep some pressure on pricing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas, JPM.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","In your Asian business, sequentially your revenues, I think, were up $16 million, and your operating profits were up $17 million. How did you do that? Or was there something unusual that happened in Asia this quarter?","James S. Sawyer","A couple things. And part of it's seasonal. But we've had 2 significant plant start-ups in Asia in -- started up at the end of the -- in the third quarter. And then we also have typically some power issues in Asia in the third quarter. And so that, overall, is the result that we'll achieve. We also had some makeup interim [ph] take-or-pay payments that came through in the fourth quarter that pertained to earlier in the year.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And in answer to a previous questioner who was asking you about other income, you reflected that other income was sort of unusually low for this quarter and that it was roughly $40 million for the year. Is that something you expect for 2013? Is the other income number something like $40 million?","James S. Sawyer","Probably not that high. I mean, it depends on whether you have any asset sales and so forth. But we generally get partnership income through that line and in several other categories of income. And then when we have severance charges and so forth, they come through that line. So you have kind of unusual things. But absent any restructuring charges or major asset sale gains, that's typically around $5 million a quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kelcey E. Hoyt","Kevin?","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My question relates to refinery hydrogen in North America. Specifically, I'm wondering if your 3- to 5-year view of growth prospects there has changed at all as a function of what's going on with the crude oil slate and the impact that shale oil discoveries have had in the U.S. You hosted a very helpful event in mid-2011 where you outlined some fairly specific goals there, and I'm just wondering if there's been any evolution of the growth view over the last 1.5 years.","James S. Sawyer","I would say that over the past 1.5 years, that as the U.S. has proved that it can be more self-sufficient in oil, what we've seen is that U.S. production of light sweet crude has substantially grown as well as natural gas liquids, which means that the reliance on heavy sour crude that we had forecasted several years ago is probably not going to pan out as much as we would have guessed several years ago. That then in turn means probably fewer new hydrogen projects for U.S. refiners. So we're really -- we've got some underway. The ones that we've got are [indiscernible]. But I'm not expecting that we'll see the same level of refinery investments in order to be able to have a more flexible slate of crude to refine. Now so we're focused more overseas with some projects in India and other locations where refinery capacity needs to be added just to meet growing demand for motor fuels and not many added specifically to refine heavy sour crude.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just to follow up, Jim. I think at the time back in 2011, you were looking for about 8 billion standard cubic feet a day of growth. And of that amount, maybe 5 billion was going to be outsourced and fracs there was looking to capture about 1\/3 of that or 1.7. Even if the market is slowing, is the amount of outsourcing similar? And is your win rate similar to your prior goals in terms of the projects that you're capturing?","James S. Sawyer","I would say the total market is definitely getting smaller than the outlook we've had there. In terms of the outsourcing, if anything, I would say that the tendency among refiners to want to outsource is growing. We're clearly seeing that in India and a number of other countries where in prior times, they had done it in-house and now they're going to outsource it. So I think that part of the equation is still very solid.","Kelcey E. Hoyt","Okay, thank you. With that, we'll end the call. Thank you for participating in our fourth quarter earnings call.

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Kelcey Hoyt, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Kelcey Hoyt","Thanks Tamara. Good morning and thank you for attending our fourth quarter earnings call and web cast. I'm joined this morning by Matt White, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Today's presentation materials are available on our website at praxair.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on page two of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference. Please also note that our discussion of earnings, including year-over-year and sequential comparisons excludes previously disclosed adjustments in 2015 and 2014. These items are detailed and reconciled to the reported GAAP numbers, and the appendices to this presentation, and the press release.","Matt and I will now review Praxair's 2015 full year and fourth quarter results, as well as our outlook for 2016, including earnings guidance. We will then be available to answer questions.","Matt White","Thanks Kelcey and good morning everyone. I'd like to kick off the call with a recap of 2015 and then update you on the trends we are currently seeing in the business segment. Its pretty clear that there were some tough macro headwinds in 2015. Double digit foreign currency devaluations, some of the worst recessionary conditions on record in South America, and a plummet in commodity prices created challenging conditions for industrial growth.","Despite these events, our organization did what it does best, adapt to current conditions and take appropriate actions on things we can't control. And while there were many accomplishments of our employees around the world to mitigate these challenges, I'd like to highlight four key areas.","First, we continued our strong management of cost and price. This is the hallmark of the Praxair culture. We adjusted our cost structure inline with economic trends, saving over $75 million per year. We improved pricing levels in nearly every region of the world, and we delivered strong productivity results. All of these efforts were quite visible in the financial statements, and led to record operating and EBITDA margins of 23.1% and 33.8% respectively.","Second, we prudently managed capital. We maintained our industry leading return on capital and delivered one of the highest free cash flow results in company history, by achieving 25% operating cash flow as a percentage of sales, and trimming capital expenditures 9% from prior year.","During 2015, we also raised the dividend 10% as part of the $1.5 billion return to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases, and we accomplished this without using leverage, as we held net debt flat.","Third, we never lost sight of the priority for quality growth. We signed six large growth projects for about $700 million of investment, including the largest in company history, to extend our hydrogen and nitrogen pipeline complex in the U.S. Gulf Coast, to supply the Yara\/BASF joint venture. Acquisitions also played an important role, with around 15 accretive deals being closed or announced, including the European industrial business of Yara, to help contribute another percent of global growth for the company.","We recently announced the joint venture with GE Aviation, to enhance our presence in the aerospace market, and provide additional resilient growth prospects, and we continue to deploy our application technologies to find more usage for our products, that enable our customers to increase productivity, lower costs, and improve their environmental footprint.","And finally, we recognized the cyclical shift in some of our end markets, and quickly adapted with a series of actions and initiatives. The renewed focus on more resilient industries and synergistic acquisitions at a reasonable price, will provide continued growth opportunities, in a world that is cyclically weaker across many sectors.","So collectively, these actions mitigated the current headwinds and better position the company for future earnings accretion, when markets turn. But unfortunately, we are seeing many negative trends continue into 2016.","When I look around at the current industrial state of the world, I don't see many things getting better, and a few are getting a little worse. The combination of excess supply and reduced demand, continues to put strain on several industrial end markets. However, we have exclusive customer supply contracts with our cylinders, tanks and pipelines, that are located at customer sites. The challenge, is that we are replenishing the gases to these assets at a lower frequency, due to our customer's lower production rates. While consistent with other prior industrial cycles, this will eventually turn and improve.","In North America, the impact of lower hydrocarbon pricing, continues to pressure many industries, including mining, oil and gas, railcar production, heavy equipment and general manufacturing. Furthermore, the stronger dollar has put additional strain on the U.S. manufacturing competitiveness. These negative trends can be seen in recent industrial production and PMI reports. However, we continue to see good demand in consumer oriented sectors, like food, beverage, automotive, healthcare, refining and chemicals. The U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemical buildout still provides good opportunities, renew on-site contracts, and we are pursuing several bids of which we expect to convert to new supply contracts soon.","South America has not improved, but rather worsened, which is consistent with our expectations. The combination of political turmoil in Brazil and the seasonal outages, significantly curtail the volumes, which will likely continue into Q1 for the carnival holiday, and possibly beyond. I believe the election result in countries like Venezuela and Argentina, will bode well for future business opportunities, but it will take some time to see any impact on the ground. ","We continue to take appropriate actions to preserve the quality of the business. But frankly, South America is becoming less and less of a component of our consolidated results, due to the severe currency devaluation. So the potential downside impact is less than prior years.","Europe is stable and slightly growing in several regions. Commodity consuming nations like Germany, Spain, Benelux and Italy have benefited from the lower cost of oil and weaker Euro. This is evidenced by the strong growth we are seeing in our port events or pipeline expansion, such as the recently announced Total contract. In addition to the positive growth across both cyclical and non-cyclical industries, commodity producing nations like Russia and those in Scandinavia are negatively feeling the effects, but we have partnered with some of the most competitive and lowest cost producers in the world. So they are still running their assets in this environment, and we anticipate that to continue.","Asia segment trends are quite different depending upon the country. Thailand and India continue to perform well, and we are seeing strong pockets of growth in both countries. Korean growth is primarily focused on the electronics industry, which has been in a strong cycle for a few years now. Although, certain areas are projected to slow. And China is the country getting the most press these days. Clearly, you have a situation of excess capacity across most infrastructure supporting industries, like steel, glass and cement. We have been seeing softness in those areas for few quarters now, and that will likely continue for 2016.","Consumer related industries are still performing well in China, as we continue to see good demand for things like transportation fuels, food, healthcare, environmental solutions and plastics. Examples include our new project startup with Yankuang, and our project signing with CNOOC. So we will have to see how China performs this year. But the underlying growth rates will be lower than what we saw in prior years.","So when you sum it up, we are just not seeing much improvement from the current weak industrial run rates. Given that, our strategic focus that we laid out over the past several months, is still valid in this environment, and you can find that on page three.","This slide shows the key elements of our focus to grow earnings and cash flow, regardless of the underlying economic conditions, and we are still on-track. Starting with the bar at the top, we are currently benefiting from the cost restructuring actions taken mid last year, and we continue to find new price and cost opportunities throughout our business. These are and will continue to contribute positive EPS growth.","On the second bar, we are proceeding well regarding synergistic acquisitions. We still expect to execute $500 million to $600 million of acquisitions this year, with over half already announced. Most of these are in developed markets, or more resilient industries, which will help enhance and insulate our business portfolio from some of the current cyclical trends. And we expect strong project backlog contribution for 2017, as some of our large fixed fee projects are slated to start in that year.","So we have mapped the path to growth for our earnings, but for 2016, it is not enough to offset the combination of foreign currency headwind, and the current trend of negative underlying volumes. I will cover this further, including guidance, at the end of the prepared remarks.","But first, Kelcey can provide some more details on our financial performance for 2016.","Kelcey Hoyt","Thanks Matt. Please turn to slide 4 for an overview of the full year. Overall sales were $10.8 billion steady with the prior year, excluding currency and cost pass-through. Price attainment contributed 1% growth, and was achieved in all reporting segments.","Volume growth from projects was about half weighted towards Asia, with the remainder of the contribution in Europe and North America. The full year volume decline, net of project contributions, was driven by weaker base volumes in the Americas, primarily in the upstream energy, manufacturing and metals end market.","Globally, food and beverage, healthcare and aerospace end markets were positive, with low to mid single digit organic growth. We completed a number of small industrial gas acquisitions during the year, that contributed about 1% to the overall growth of Praxair. These synergistic acquisitions will continue to enhance our production network density in all operating segments.","Operating profit of $2.5 billion grew 1% year-over-year, excluding foreign currency from higher pricing, cost actions and acquisitions. As a result, we grew full year EBITDA and operating margins to record level. Earnings per share of $5.80 grew 3%, excluding foreign currency.","Please turn to slide 5 for an overview of cash flow; through consistent capital and operational discipline, we generated strong operating cash flow of $2.7 billion for the year, at 25% of sales.","During 2015, $1.5 billion was prudently invested in CapEx for growth and density improvement. These investments are in our core regions and meet our disciplined investment criteria. More than half of the CapEx spend during 2015 occurred in North America, with the rest equally distributed to Asia, Europe and South America. During 2016, CapEx is expected to be even more weighted towards North America, given its larger share of the backlog.","When our end markets and geographies are in lower growth cycles like today, we typically generate more free cash flow than periods of stronger capital investment. Since the majority of our capital spend is for growth projects, that are only initiated with executed customer contracts. As a result, this morning we announced a 5% increase to our quarterly dividend, which represents our 23rd consecutive annual increase. This is consistent with our policy to grow dividends each year. The remaining cash that we have after growth investments and dividends, is directed towards share repurchases. During 2015, we reduced our outstanding share count by 2%. This was our sixth consecutive year of reducing the share count by at least 1%.","Now please turn to slide 6 for an overview of the fourth quarter; fourth quarter sales were $2.6 billion and 1% lower than the prior year, excluding currency impacts and cost pass through. Organic sales increased from higher pricing in most operating segments. Lower base volumes continue to be driven by the Americas, primarily in the manufacturing, upstream energy and metals end markets. This was partially offset by new volumes from project startups in Asia and Europe, as well as global growth in refining, food and beverage, healthcare and aerospace end markets. Small acquisitions within all segments contributed 1% growth. ","By operating segment, North America's organic sales declined 3% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The business achieved price improvement in the U.S., Mexico and Canada. Weaker volumes for manufacturing customers drove about half of the volume decline. This was primarily due to hardgoods, as customers are reducing investment in capital equipment, given the uncertainty in demand, and headwinds from imports, with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. The remaining volume softness was driven by upstream energy and metals, with metals down 16% organically year-over-year and 8% sequentially. This was partially mitigated by end market growth from refinery, healthcare and food and beverage customers.","In Europe, organic sales grew 4% year-over-year and were down 1% sequentially. Year-over-year growth was primarily driven by price attainment in most countries, project contribution in Russia, and higher base volumes in Spain. Sequential volume declines were primarily due to upstream energy customers.","South America's underlying sales were down 1% year-over-year, as volume declines in most end markets were partially offset by price contribution, acquisitions and growth in the healthcare and food and beverage end markets. Sequentially, volumes were down 6%, due to further deteriorating industrial production and extended holiday shutdowns by customers in Brazil. This occurred in most end markets with the largest impact in manufacturing, which represents about 20% of Brazil sales.","Underlying growth in Asia was 6% higher than last year, and 2% higher sequentially, primarily driven by new project startups in China and India, growing carbon dioxide sales in Thailand, and acquisitions. Surface Technologies organic growth was down 2% year-over-year, driven by energy and industrial end markets; and up 4% sequentially, driven by stronger aerospace coatings.","Global consolidated operating profit was $624 million in the fourth quarter and grew 5% over the prior year, excluding foreign currency. We are seeing the benefits of our restructuring actions, price attainment and acquisitions. The fourth quarter operating profit end margin also benefited from a gain on sale in North America.","Earnings per share of $1.47 grew 5% year-over-year, excluding currency. Operating cash flow was $791 million, represented 30% of sales, and funded $387 million of capital expenditures. The company paid $204 million of dividend and repaid $203 million of debt to hold net debt steady for the year.","Our project backlog, which we define as projects with CapEx greater than $5 million and associated with a fully executed customer supply contract, is currently $1.5 billion and comprised of 18 projects.","During the fourth quarter, we signed two long term contracts for new projects, located in North America and Europe, and started two projects in Asia. Existing backlog projects will startup and contribute to growth during 2016 through 2018, as shown on slide 16. North America now reflects about 45% of the backlog.","We continue to look selectively for tuck-in acquisitions in our core business, which are high quality, low risk properties, where we can bring synergies to the business we are buying, and we can achieve an attractive return on investment.","During the fourth quarter, we bought three industrial gas businesses in the U.S., with multiple locations and combined sales of more than $20 million annually. And we increased ownership of an existing joint venture in Asia.","I now turn the call back to Matt, who will discuss our outlook and earnings guidance for 2016.","Matt White","Please turn to page 6; our full year guidance for 2016 is in the range of $5.30 to $5.70. While the entire range is below our 2015 EPS, it does include $0.42 or 7% anticipated headwind from foreign currency translation. The lower right of the slide, you can see the average 2015 FX rates for some of our major currencies, which were all much stronger than what the current spot rates are today.","Excluding the FX impact, we expect underlying EPS to grow to be a low of minus 2% to a high of plus 5%. There are a few key drivers that comprise this range. We expect to deliver positive EPS growth from our price, productivity and the 2015 cost actions. Many of these items are already completed, and we have a high level of confidence in our ability to continue to improve our earnings going forward, through these company-specific actions.","We also are expecting EPS accretion through our acquisitions and share buyback program. These are good examples of contribution from our capital allocation process. We have closed several synergistic acquisitions, and anticipate completing a few more early this year, which will be immediately accretive to our results. These are primarily tuck-in acquisitions, that serve more resilient markets and enhance our existing portfolio.","In addition, our excess free cash flow has enabled us to consistently repurchase shares without increasing debt levels. So we also feel good about contribution from these areas, as most of them are already completed.","Product volume is really the key unknown factor, and an addition to foreign currency will vary the most in the near term. You can see the range showing more downside risk than upside.","The top end of this range, represents our project volume startup, which we have good visibility into, and assumes slightly positive underlying volume growth. The bottom end represents the same project growth with current underlying volume trends of negative low to mid single digit percent.","As I mentioned earlier, this volume is tied to our existing network of pipelines, tanks and cylinders. So the contracts and assets are in place, but we simply aren't supplying them at the same rate, due to the slower demand environment. We will continue to take actions to improve on this range, but this is our best estimate at this time.","Turning to the first quarter, we are calling an EPS range of $1.20 to $1.28. This range is down 10% to 16% from last year, of which 9% relates to FX impact. So we are anticipating underlying EPS to be down 1% to 7%. While we have the full benefit of cost reductions in our results, we don't expect that to fully offset the lower volumes, seen primarily in North and South America. We expect Q1 to be the weakest for 2016, given the normal seasonal impact coupled with the abnormally low volume trends, coming out of 2015. We saw extended seasonal outages during the fourth quarter, and we anticipate similar trends for the first quarter.","The first half of 2016, especially the first quarter, will be more challenging than the back half. However, we have developed a strategy around this environment, and have taken actions in anticipation of these trends. Our business usually leads these cycles, given the nature of our industry and end markets. We expect the lead to recovery. And while near term trends will be pressured, we will continue to take prudent and appropriate actions for long term shareholder value creation.","I'd now like to open up the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Your line is now open.","Mike Harrison","Hi, good morning.","Matt White","Good morning Mike.","Mike Harrison","Matt, can you give us any color on the timing and kind of volume contribution of new project startups during 2016? It looks from your chart there like you are expecting maybe kind of 3% to 4% volume contribution there at the high end potentially. And then how much stronger does that get, as we get into 2017 with the new project startups?","Matt White","Sure Mike. So I think, starting with 2015, as you may recall, we had talked about 2015 being kind of close to 2% -- 1% to 2% range on project contribution. I am expecting that to be similar heading into 2016. We have a fairly similar profile of startup. 2017 is where we really expect that to step up, and that will be closer to the 3%, 4% kind of mid-term range that we had given out a few years ago. So, we do have a gap in 2015 and 2016 on project startups. Part of it are things like the Chevron project. As you recall, that we ultimately ended up selling that asset, and as opposed to starting up as a sale of gas. But I would expect 2016 to be similar to 2015.","Mike Harrison","All right. And then you noted some CO2 supply outages in Latin America. What portion of your sales in Latin America come from CO2, and is that negatively impacting your ability to supply beverage CO2? Can you just give a little color on that?","Matt White","Sure. I would say, first of all when you look at merchant and package in total, for South America, it's about two-thirds of the whole business there. CO2 is an important merchant liquid for us, and as you probably know it, we generally feedstock -- we get the feedstock from various processes and industries. And given the situation in Brazil from an industrial perspective, rates are so low on everything from refineries to ammonia plants to chemical plants, that the CO2 sources now are actually going down for extend outage periods.","So what's happening there is, while we are still meeting the requirements that there are for food and beverage, its causing us -- extra costs. We have to haul the product much further, dislocation costs. So yes, its creating some inefficiencies in our system right now, given our supply-source outages, and its just something we have to manage and live with. I do hope that some of these will come backstream here, back in the first quarter, we are seeing a few begin to startup again. But that's something that impacted in Q4, will impact in Q1, and we will have to see beyond that.","Mike Harrison","All right. And then the last one for me, the pricing number in Asia was flat. Have you gotten to a point where you have neutralized the impact of the merchant overcapacity there? Where are you getting offsets to the negative merchant pricing?","Matt White","So with Asia, we still see some good pricing for either specialty or electronic assets, whether that's helium, xenon, neon, and those continue to contribute some positive pricing. The merchant gases of LIN and LOX and argon, still are pressured. But as you know, we have been going more towards a direct model, less through a distributor model. So I'd say, we are getting a combination of -- I will call it mix benefit by shifting more direct. And also, we are trying to take some price action. But the supply\/demand imbalance there still is an issue, especially in certain parts of the country, and we will just see in terms of capacity. If you start to see some steel capacity come out of these tier-II, tier-III steel player, that will help the mix on the merchant liquid.","Mike Harrison","Understood. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Your line is now open.","Emily Wagner","Hi its actually Emily Wagner on for Don this morning. We just had a couple of questions in terms of the volume terms in North America. How much could you say the trend was driven by weakness in Canada and Mexico in the fourth quarter?","Matt White","Well, I would say right now, one of the -- the two biggest areas we are seeing from softness in North America, the recent trends would be in metals and in hardgoods. And the hardgoods is really mostly Canada and U.S., and that's just a function of both less equipment and less hardgoods going into some of these sectors like heavy equipment, energy, manufacturing, and also we are just electing not to sell some of these hardgoods, given the margins are just not attractive to us at this time.","As far as the metals, that's primarily U.S. We are seeing some slower volumes from some of the import issues coming into the country, as well as just some of the slowing demand on certain infrastructure projects. But Mexico is mostly an energy issue that's played out in our results. It has been in our run rate for a couple of quarters, almost a year, and excluding that, Mexico is still doing quite well. Canada is mostly an energy issue story, and that also has had some negative impact here over the last few quarters, there could be a little more risk going forward. Excluding that, Canada, on the Eastern side of the country, is doing fairly well, due to the weak currency there, its making their products more competitive. But I would say, most of the challenges you're seeing in the U.S. are either related to the strong dollar, which is hurting the manufacturing, or the impact of the energy metals side, that's working its way through the supply system.","Emily Wagner","Have you broken out your end markets exposure in North America to energy and steel?","Matt White","Yeah. We actually provide that in all of our external filings. So you will see that in the 10-K that will come out here in a few weeks. But you can see it from our last Q also.","Emily Wagner","Okay. Thank you.","Matt White","Welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Sison with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is now open.","Michael Sison","Hey, good morning.","Matt White","Good morning Mike.","Michael Sison","Can you give us your thoughts on, maybe longer term, where can South America sort of be in terms of earnings power over time, given to where its at in the past, and where it is now?","Matt White","Yeah. Mike, you may recall, we have actually included in the package, the backup, sort of how South America has been as a portion of our business over time. And it's something that, at its height as a segment, it was almost 20% of the operating profit of the entire company. Today, it's slightly above 10%. So we have seen these cycles go up and down on the segment. I mean, you look today, South America as a whole, as a percentage of the company, is approaching kind of 2003-2004 levels.","So I would say, if it continues on its path of shrinking, the shrinking is less severe, than obviously coming off the peak at 2010-2011. But if it does recover the kind of the levels we have seen in the past, that's pretty significant upside, both from a growth perspective and the topline, but over the earnings, because we tend to get pretty accretive growth when it recovers.","So we will have to say; as I mentioned earlier I think, you are seeing some positive developments on the government side, in countries like Argentina and Venezuela. It will take time to work through, but you are getting more business friendly approaches in some of the governments there. I think Brazil needs more time to work through their issues. 2016 will be another tough year. 2017, we will have to see. But they do have an election in 2018. But I think right now, that is the lowest level it has been in over a decade, as far as an impact to our organization, and we will just have to see going forward.","Michael Sison","Right. And then just a quick follow-up, you talked about acquisitions, an area that can help growth this year. You have kind of done half of what you had hoped. Are the rest of them, kind of smaller ones, are there bigger opportunities? Can you look at your JVs? Can you just kind of walk us through where growth can come from in that this year?","Matt White","Sure. It will probably be a collection of smaller ones. As Kelcey mentioned, we did another three in the U.S., just this quarter here in packaged gas. And that will give us over $20 million of incremental sales. But it will be many, packaged gas, tuck-ins, primarily in the Americas, but we do have some opportunities in Europe and Asia as well. And we will just have more that will be coming through here, just given the situation that we have, as far as some of the targets are being more, I'd say open around valuation and strategic options.","Michael Sison","Great. Thank you.","Matt White","Welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Jeff Zekauskas","What's the $28 million other income item, and how does it distribute through the segments?","Matt White","So most of that Jeff, is the gain on asset sale that Kelcey had mentioned, and its primarily North America.","Jeff Zekauskas","Where else is it?","Matt White","Its spread all over. Normally other income, we average per year $10 million to $15 million net income, and it\u2019s a combination of things like some non-consolidated affiliate income, that maybe before tax line, gains, losses on asset sales, etcetera. So the rest of it would be spread across, but the larger piece is North America.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks. I think your interest expense this year has bounced around a little bit? And that I think in the third quarter it was $35 million and it was $42 million in this one. Can you talk about the volatility in it, and what do you expect for 2016?","Matt White","Sure, in our interest, as you can imagine, we have capitalized interest, the normal bond it. But we also have the derivatives on all of our intercompany loans that we hedge. So the primarily volatility we have been seeing, has been their gains, frankly, that we have picked up on these intercompany hedges. Mostly China, and their sort of one-off items. But its just a little bit of noise that's creating that on a normalized basis, our interest run rate should be kind of mid-40s. We have been doing some terming out of our bonds. So while its causing our interest costs to go up a little bit, it's actually improving the bond portfolio for us, for being out much longer in terms of term.","But I would say, modeling our interest, probably mid 40s is kind of where we expect the next few quarters.","Jeff Zekauskas","And then lastly, do you think that the direction of your capital expenditures over a three to five year period will be downward or flat or upward?","Matt White","Well, the last couple of years has been downward. And it's really going to be a function of the projects we sign. But when I look right now, we are saying around $1.5 billion for 2016. I think it can be lower than that. We are taking actions to manage that. If we sign a few large projects here, that could alter the course. So its really a function of how many growth projects we sign. But the non-large growth, we are absolutely continuing to take efforts to manage those numbers down and in line with what we are seeing in the markets around us.","So I think it can go down on its own, and then the rest is just a function of new project signings.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Matt White","Welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Duffy Fischer","Yes. Good morning. There has been a lot talked about the difficulties of steel in China, and the hope that some of the smaller, maybe unprofitable guy shut down and they have their own air separation units, so you take some offline that way. But there are also some steel plants that are somewhat competitive, that maybe have their own oxygen that would be looking to sell it in a tough financial situation like that. And if so, is that stuff that would interest you investing in China kind of at this low point, or you are trying to pull back from investing in China today?","Matt White","Well, I think, in my mind in China investments, I would sort of break it in two categories. There is investing in assets that relate to infrastructure, whether that's steel, cement, glass. I think right now, that entire sector is just too much capacity. So there needs to be some rationalization and I would see future investments in those areas being extremely limited.","The other sector of the Chinese economy in the consumer side, there still are good investment opportunities. They tend to be smaller plans, they tend to be less capital intensive. It could be, things in environmental, in food, in that we continue to see good opportunities. But when I look at the steel capacity in China right now, our steel customers are what I call tier-I. So these are the Bao steel type customers there. And they are very competitive globally. They are very well integrated, and they can withstand these cycles.","There are tier-II and tier-III steel mills that have been popped up all over the country, and those are the ones I think from a liquidity standpoint and a competitive standpoint are struggling.","Now just the Premier recently here announced their goal to take out about 100 million to 150 million tonnes a year capacity. And just to put that in perspective, that's like the entire capacity of the United States. But they are looking to rationalize and take that out, which I think would be great. I don't know when it will happen, but if that could be accelerated, that should be very beneficial on a couple of fronts, it should reduce some of the steel production and some of the imports to other countries like the U.S. But it also should help on the liquid merchant front.","So in my mind, if those are rationalized, we would not have an interest in those assets. I don't think they are viable, and you can't run the air separation plant without some baseload cost effectively. So I would rather sit back and wait and let some of this rationalization happen that they have announced, and I think that would be beneficial and constructive for the market.","Duffy Fischer","Okay. And then a similar question for Latin America, obviously lot of economic pressure there. Is there a chance that meaningful assets would be available in Latin America, and is that an area, that's still of interest for you to grow in, inorganically?","Matt White","Yeah. I mean, we are in Latin America, and in the 90s, when you had the last sort of economic significant downturn, we did exactly what you are saying, Duffy. We rolled up a lot of the steel mill assets the air separation assets. We consolidated and grew our business fairly significantly during that downturn.","In this downturn, we still are doing things like that. Its just the opportunity set is smaller. There is not as many as there was back 20 years or so ago. So yes, we continue to do it, it just may not be as big as it was in prior years.","Duffy Fischer","Great. Thank you.","Matt White","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of PJ Juvekar with Citi. Your line is now open.","Prashant Juvekar","Yes, hi. As you progress through the fourth quarter, did you see a slowdown from month-to-month, meaning that -- was December much weaker than October, if you take the seasonality out?","Matt White","Yeah. The seasonality part is a little tricky, which you tend to find in weaker demand production environments like we are, is they will extend the seasonal pieces. So they will have normal shutdown that they will actually extend. And I think you saw a little bit of that in certain regions, where they took, for instance, the Christmas Holiday season, or in South America, the summer holiday period, and they extended some of the outages around that. So I would say, we saw the normal seasonal plus a little bit more demand reduction or production reduction, and we will see how that carries into the new year.","Prashant Juvekar","Okay. And then, if I look at your backlog, project backlog, it was about $1.9 billion a year ago. Its now $1.5 billion, and we know there is troubles in Brazil, the slowdown in China. It seems like global CapEx is slowing down. What is your expectation for your project backlog, going forward? ","Matt White","So this year, we expect of the startups we have slated, might be another $500 million, $600 million that would come out of the backlog. So with no absolute change, that would drop it to $1 billion or below. I am expecting to sign a few large projects, and that should help tick it back up, but you also need to look at the acquisition front as well. So we are stepping up what we are spending in the acquisition. So I do think some of the backlog, that is declining a bit, is being replaced by acquisitions. I kind of look at both of them equally, in terms of avenues to invest capital to grow. So it is going down a bit. But acquisitions are stepping up a bit, and we have seen this in some of the cycles before.","But holding all else constant, I got about $500 million, $600 million that will come out this year. But we feel good about some of the key large projects that we have, to help bring that up, at least if not fully, partially.","Prashant Juvekar","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Vincent Andrews","Thanks very much. Matt, if I just think about your guidance, and I am just going to try to characterize it a bit. You talked about, in 1Q you are expecting sort of the slow volumetric trends to continue from the second half into the first quarter. And then if I think about the comments you made about overall 2016, the two big sort of impacts and uncertainties were foreign exchange and then volume. So if the second half weakness is going to continue into the first quarter, is it a correct statement to say that we need to see some type of positive inflection, kind of into 2Q or into 3Q, in order to get above the mid range of your guidance, absent some further help from maybe foreign currency reversing? Is that not correct?","Matt White","I think that's pretty close. If you exclude foreign currency to your point, I mean, the top end right now, if you started negative in the first half, you would need some positive in the back half to achieve the top end, which is little to no growth. Right? To get zero for the year, if you start a little bit negative, you got to finish a little bit positive.","At the bottom end of our range, essentially assumes the current negative kind of low to mid single digit trends continue all year, unabated. So yes, that's kind of how we have it laid out right now. Obviously, if we get surprised to the upside on growth, that could help. And the one nice thing about this industry in general is, is when growth comes, and it comes pretty quickly; because as I mentioned, the assets are there, its just a matter of refilling them faster, at a faster rate, or putting more molecules into the pipeline. So we will have to see. But your characterization, I think is pretty close.","Vincent Andrews","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, Airgas yesterday reported negative 10% hardgoods sales in their quarter. And I am just wondering, sort of generically if you think, you made a comment about some of the hardgood weakness, was a function of people just sort of holding off because of uncertainty. I am just wondering, if you still think hardgoods is a real leading indicator of where gas demand is going to be, or some of that negativity has been skewed, maybe by what's going on in oil and gas to such an extent, or maybe there isn't such a clear indicator of the overall U.S. packaged gas business?","Matt White","It has been tough. We have looked on this, and sometimes, it seems like a leading indicator, sometimes it doesn't. But I characterize hardgoods into two basic buckets, you have large equipment and then you have consumables. The large equipment, as you can imagine, its very large numbers that come in lumpy. And when you see large equipment purchases like automatic welders or cutters, that's when things are usually going quite well, and the customer base is confident enough, and furthermore, their backlog is big enough, that they want to invest in automation. So we saw a lot of that, a year plus ago, primarily in the oil patch, but also in the whole center part of the country that served some of the manufacturing sector that build pumps and rigs and other things for the oil patch.","So we were seeing a lot of automated equipment being purchased, and also just a function of shortage of skilled labors, skilled welders and so forth. So that part, we have had to lap. The consumables is the one that can sometimes move right with gas. You are going to use so much wire and contact tips, usually as much gas as you use.","So I would say, the equipment has been a little bit of a front end indicator, and we have seen that. Now, its just a function of some of the consumables and just some other hardgoods that we, personally, are just not going to serve that market if the margins aren't worth our effort at this point.","Vincent Andrews","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Manthey with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.","David Manthey","Thank you. Hi Matt. You mentioned that you are making acquisitions in areas that serve more resilient end markets? I was just wondering if you could help us understand what you meant by that? And then second, as it relates to the sort of generic U.S. tuck-in packaged gas distributor, has the multiple that you're paying for those, changed at all since the Airgas-Air Liquide deal?","Matt White","Okay. First on the resilient markets, I can give you some specific examples we have already announced. So Tecnogas in Peru, CO2 business, primarily food and beverage accounts that it serves. The Yara CO2 business in Europe, similar, a lot of food, beverage, dry ice, which applications go in very different areas. Some of the packaged gas businesses that we are acquiring, have specialty gases, large portion of specialty gases, and those tend to go into more industries like environmental, research, calibration gases. We have also done some medical acquisitions in Canada, with our medical gases business, as well as in South America. So those will be more into some of the hospitals and the home care areas.","So those are kinds of examples where we have gone deeper into what we will call resilient industries, that don't tend to move with the cycles of the manufacturing or industry.","As far as multiples on tuck-ins, we really haven't see much change, as you can imagine. We have been pretty disciplined on how we look at multiples and what we are willing to pay. And clearly, there is a large potential buyer that's going to be in pause for a while here. But we haven't really seen much, as far as valuations change on some of these deals.","David Manthey","Okay. Thank you. And then second, I know your backlog includes only fully executed contracts, but could you talk about what mechanisms those customers would have to either delay or cancel those contracts to the extent they can?","Matt White","Yeah. So for most contracts, a cancellation usually triggers what's called a termination payment, which is essentially a net present value of all the fixed payments. So those are pretty big numbers and pretty onerous, and you just don't see that of any project of any size.","As far as delays, most of our contracts have some type of date, certain clause, which will ensure that if the project is delayed, we either get paid day one regardless, or we get recovery through the fixed facility fee through a higher fee due to the time-loss value.","So we do have mechanisms to account for that. Of the projects that we have right now in the backlog, there is no material delays that we can see. But we do have some mechanisms. Now obviously, if the delay is due to us, that's a different issue. But these are more, if it\u2019s the customers' reasons why they delayed, we do have economic recovery mechanisms.","David Manthey","Got it. Thank you very much.","Matt White","Welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Your line is now open.","John Roberts","Thank you. How much of surface tech is now aviation, given that oilfield and industrial hardened equipment is probably down a lot?","Matt White","Yeah, its growing faster than the others, that's for sure. Its roughly about a third. Given the new announcement joint venture we have, we do expect that sector of that business to grow at a much more rapid rate. But its roughly a third.","John Roberts","And then does the JV impair your ability to somehow find options for the remaining part of surface tech over time?","Matt White","No. I think the JV enhances the value of the whole business, and right now, we are doing everything we can to help that business grow, make it more profitable. But clearly, the more we can enhance the value of the business, the more attractive it is overall.","John Roberts","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Chris Wolf","Hi guys. This is Chris on for Bob. Just curious, industrial CapEx, where you view that, where are we in this cycle for that -- sort of building off of prior questions?","Matt White","You know, I am probably the wrong person to ask. I am not sure. When you look at the cycles right now, and you look at mining, oil and gas, metals, we are in a pretty tough spot. I think from a demand perspective, they are all in kind of a deep demand cyclical challenge. From a supply perspective, metals is a little different, because of this China situation. So that's one that's short of some capacity rationalization in China. It could be a little more difficult, and that's our view right now.","But oil and gas, and some of the other traditionally cyclical. I don't know. I don't know when they will recover. The movements are pretty radical in a day you're seeing on some of these commodities. So we will have to see going forward. But, its hard to say.","Chris Wolf","Okay. And then, looking at your acquisitions and your backlog, when you guys sort of mentioned this, it seems like you are sort of derisking a portfolio, and is this reflecting just where the near term opportunities are or a long term strategic view?","Matt White","It\u2019s a little bit of both. Clearly, the near term opportunities are greater in some of -- as far as growth, are greater in some of the non-cyclical portions of the portfolio. So by investing in those areas, we can capture greater growth in this current and sort of near term outlook.","I think there is also a long term approach, which is just to further balance our portfolio. I mean, you go back several years, we took advantage of some high cycles in certain commodity markets, and we are not ashamed of that. We did quite well in that front, and now some of those cycles are at low points, and we just need to rebalance our portfolio like we do, and be able to insulate it from some of the cycles, and when those cycles return, we will be well positioned for that as well.","So it\u2019s a little bit of both, and we need to continue to manage our portfolio around these trends.","Chris Wolf","Great. One quick one then, where do you -- after the volume downturns across the globe, where do you see merchant utilization rates, sort of by geography?","Matt White","So, not too different than I think what we said in the past. But the U.S., probably a little lower high. So maybe high 70s versus, we were probably 80 a couple of quarters ago. And part of that is, the energy business was a lot of liquid nitrogen, but also some argon, you're seeing a little weaker, given the manufacturing slowing in the U.S. South America is kind of mid to high 70s. Sounds fairly high, given what you have seen down here, but a lot of our merchant goes into non-cyclical business, so its food, beverage, healthcare. So those still are holding fairly well in South America.","Europe is also mid to high 70s. We are moving a little more product and we have seen some pickup and improvement there. And Asia is kind of, I will call mid-70s, it depends on the country, we had some capacity come on in India, which will lower that number a bit as the capacity gets loaded. China is a little lower, especially now with the New Year. Lunar New Year holiday, you tend to see it soften a bit in Q1. But I'd say that's in the mid-70s.","So not radically different around the world. We definitely have ample capacity for when things recover.","Chris Wolf","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrne with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Stephen Byrne","Matt, in some of your earlier remarks, you referenced that hydrogen and nitrogen opportunity down in Texas, with that ammonia plant that Yara and BASF are building. We understand that the primary source of the hydrogen is the ethylene cracker of Dow. Is that the case? And if so, are your returns on a project like that meaningfully better than in on-demand hydrogen source, like building an SMR for such a project?","Matt White","Well I think Steve, when you look at the overall Gulf, we have a very strong network of pipelines, a cavern, in the case of the hydrogen situation to store, as well as, on-purpose production, through things like steam methane reformers and air separation units on the atmospheric side, as well as byproduct. So we will take byproduct from core alkali crackers, etcetera, and bring them into our system.","Clearly, having a blend of both, we believe is a nice benefit, because it is a lower capital intensive approach. But you do need both, because you have to give certain reliability and quality standards to the customers you supply into. So this is part of what's always been our long term strategy, in the hydrogen in syngas business, which is to have a combination of both on-purpose and sourcing. And it does help on the capital footprint. ","Now clearly, you need to make pipelines, you have to have compression, you have to have assets that can clean up the actual hydrogen source you are taking. Its usually not to the right purity that you need. But its all part of our overall strategy, and it does help us deliver the reliability and quantity that we need for our customer base, and it gives us flexibility, in terms of how we run our asset fleet connected to that whole pipeline.","So I'd say yes, we are very happy with it. We think it gives us a very strong competitive advantage and bidding for new projects, and we are looking to continue bidding off this network for some of the new opportunities throughout the whole Gulf.","Stephen Byrne","And would you say that some of those opportunities might be the other half-a-dozen crackers that are under construction? Are you looking at those as additional sources of hydrogen?","Matt White","Yes. We will continue to look at those as sources. But we don't want to get caught too long either. So its always a combination of managing your source and your sync. And so its just part of that process.","Stephen Byrne","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And I am showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Kelcey Hoyt for any final remarks.","Kelcey Hoyt","Thank you again for participating in our fourth quarter earnings call. If you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to me directly. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."],"17652":["Praxair, Inc.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Ms. Kelcey Hoyt, Director of Investor Relations. Ma\u2019am, you may begin.","Kelcey Hoyt","Thanks, Ayela. Good morning and thank you for attending our first quarter earnings call and webcast. I am joined this morning by Matt White, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Liz Hirsch, our Vice President and Controller.","Today\u2019s presentation materials are available on our website at praxair.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slide and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference. In addition, please note that year-over-year and sequential comparisons exclude a bond redemption charge in the first quarter. The reconciliation to the U.S. GAAP reported numbers are in the appendix to this presentation and the press release.","Matt and I will now review Praxair\u2019s first quarter results, including the current business environment and updated earnings guidance. We will then be available to answer questions.","Matt White","Good morning, everyone and thanks for attending. First quarter EPS finished at $1.28, which was at the higher end of our expectations. Cost management and foreign exchange rates in March were better than we originally anticipated. Global volume trends were a bit mixed as we saw certain end markets improving, with others remaining at fairly low levels. By the second half of this year, we will start to lap some of the more difficult prior year comparisons. So, I anticipate year-over-year trends should improve.","Starting in North America, volumes were weaker across our major industrial end markets of energy, metals, chemicals, and manufacturing. Chemicals and downstream energy were primarily driven by extensive turnaround activity in the U.S. Gulf Coast, which we expect to improve over the next few quarters. Metals, manufacturing and upstream energy trends have been driven by the commodity price collapse coupled with the strong dollar impact to our U.S. market. I expect upstream energy to remain fairly sluggish as most wells are not being completed therefore deferring the need for any nitrogen. We have seen some recent uptick in our steel customers as a combination of import duties and lower inventories have resulted in higher production volumes.","On the manufacturing front, while we have seen some sequential improvement in our onsite and merchant business units. U.S. packaged gas volumes have still been quite weak, especially hardgoods. In fact, U.S. hardgoods alone are driving our volumes down a full percentage point on the global results. Part of this is from weaker demand due to the slower investment cycle and part from us not participating in some low margin hardgood business. We have seen this late cycle reaction in our PDI business in the past. So, it seems consistent with our prior experience.","Looking forward, we may have a few more quarters to go with difficult U.S. packaged gas conditions, but the onsite and merchant businesses seem to be improving modestly. Canada continues to improve in the Eastern part of the country from a weaker Canadian dollar, especially in the food, manufacturing and healthcare end markets, while the west and north continue to struggle from low commodity pricing. And excluding the energy market, Mexico is growing mid single-digits from a weak peso and a very strong manufacturing base.","In South America, the volume decline appears to be stabilizing, but it\u2019s quite difficult to predict anything there right now. While there has been a flurry of financial market activity related to the political situation in Brazil, we really haven\u2019t seen much change on the ground regarding industrial activity. We did see some sequential volume improvement in merchant and packaged gases off a very weak fourth quarter. Brazilian markets of healthcare and food and beverage are growing double-digits from prior year, while industrial markets continue to struggle. We are achieving mid single-digit pricing in our merchant and packaged gas businesses, but it isn\u2019t enough to overcome current inflation. So, we are initiating new price actions for this year and continuing our cost containment efforts.","Margins have eroded from a combination of lower volumes, higher cost and continued excess dislocation costs from CO2 sourced outages. First quarter is always the weakest due to carnival and summer holiday, but we did see volumes pickup in March and we anticipate further seasonal growth into the second quarter. Europe has been steadily improving each quarter. Year-over-year volumes have increased a few percentage points supported by project startups and some volume growth in Southern Europe. Almost all end markets are up over last year, with the exception of upstream energy. We have been able to capitalize this and achieve a steady improvement in operating margins, up to 19.4% for the quarter.","We anticipate second quarter volumes will sequentially increase from project startups and the Yara acquisition. This acquisition will significantly grow our supply network and density for CO2 serving key Brazilian markets throughout Continental Europe. In our Asia segment, we continue to see mid single-digit volume growth, but a challenging price environment in China. The first quarter is seasonally the weakest in Asia due to the Lunar New Year, yet we still were able to achieve 6% volume growth, primarily from project startups. In China, industrial end markets continue to be plagued with overcapacity as the economy attempts to shift to more consumer and service driven growth. We haven\u2019t seen much impact yet on steel capacity reduction, but we feel good about our Tier 1 steel customers as they continue to run their operations throughout this period.","Other infrastructure-related industries are also struggling as capacity is being rationalized. So, we have seen our glass customers lower their production rates. And while Western expansion of coal to liquid projects has been significantly curtailed, we have limited our exposure there and instead focused on coal to chemical projects with highly competitive customers in the East. As such, chemical and electronic markets are growing well and we are increasing our focus toward food, healthcare and environmental applications. Our Indian business is growing mid single-digits driven by combination of project startups and stronger industrial activity. Korea performed as expected from consumer electronic trends and our Thai business has been growing in the food and transportation end markets.","I will wrap it up with our Surface Technologies business, which as you all know, is a global business. PST serves three key end markets of aerospace, energy and industrial. The energy business has weighed negatively on the results due to collapse in oil price and subsequent reduction in coatings for oilfield equipment, although we have recently seen positive trends for coatings to industrial gas turbines. Industrial segment growth rates have also been lower due to global trends. Aerospace however continues to be a bright spot through our strong customer partnerships and air travel trends. We also have seen very high growth rates in our metal powders business serving the 3D printing market. Finally, we expect to startup our GE Aviation joint venture by middle of this year, which should improve the business growth rates.","On balance, I would say our first quarter trends were slightly better than we expected. We still have several challenged end markets and the late cycle laggers, but we are seeing some positive volume trends in key geographies. And while our EPS is still down year-over-year from a combination of negative foreign currency translation and softer volumes, this is the second quarter in a row that our operating cash flow has grown over prior year. Furthermore, we continue to tightly manage our CapEx spending resulting in 100% increase in first quarter free cash flow.","I will now hand it over to Kelcey to walk through the financial results.","Kelcey Hoyt","Thanks, Matt. Now, please turn to Slide #4 for our consolidated results. Overall, sales were $2.5 billion, 1% lower than last year, excluding currency and cost pass-through. Price attainment contributed 1% growth and was achieved in most reporting segments. The majority of volume growth from new project startups occurred in Asia, with the remainder of revenue contribution largely in Europe. We continue to see solid growth out of the more resilient end markets globally with food and beverage and healthcare growing 7% and 3% respectively. The volume decline year-over-year net of project contribution was primarily driven by weaker base volumes in North America, largely in the energy, manufacturing and metals end markets. Sequentially, volumes were down 1% versus the fourth quarter as the improvement in South America was offset by seasonal declines in Asia and the timing of customer turnaround in North America.","By operating segment, North America organic sales declined 4% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The business achieved price improvement from merchant and packaged gases. Weaker packaged gas volumes drove about half of the 5% volume decline, largely hard goods. The remaining volume softness included continued lower upstream energy and metal sales year-over-year. In addition, chemical and refinery volumes were negatively impacted by the timing of customer turnarounds. Sequentially, organic growth to metals and manufacturing customers was more than offset by the impact of customer turnarounds, as well as modest further weakness in packaged gases.","In Europe, organic sales grew 2% year-over-year and were down 2% sequentially. Year-over-year growth was primarily driven by project contribution in Russia and higher base volumes in Southern Europe. Sequential volume declines include the seasonal impact of the Easter holiday, as well as further weakness in upstream energy. South America\u2019s organic sales grew 1% year-over-year as price attainment offset the impact of lower volumes. Year-over-year volumes again outperformed local industrial production as growth in healthcare and food and beverage mitigated volume declines and manufacturing. Sequentially, organic growth of 8% included 3% from new price actions, as well as volume growth from healthcare, food and beverage and even a modest improvement in manufacturing off of a very weak fourth quarter base.","Organic sales in Asia were 5% higher than last year, primarily driven by new project startups in China to chemical customers and in India to metals customers. Sequentially, volumes included the seasonal impact of Lunar New Year. Surface Technologies organic sales were down 5% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, driven by energy and industrial end markets.","Operating profit of $554 million was down 4% from the prior year period, excluding currency. Higher pricing increased operating profit, but was more than offset by lower volumes. Operating margin was 22.1% and the EBITDA margin grew 30 basis points to 33.3%. Earnings per share of $1.28 was down 3% excluding foreign currency. Through relentless operational discipline, we generated strong operating cash flow of $547 million, 22% of sales. This funded acquisitions of $63 million and capital expenditures of $323 million, about 65% of which was in North America given its greater share of projects in the backlog. In addition, the company paid $240 million of dividend.","Our capital allocation process is consistent and disciplined. The remaining cash that we have after growth investments and dividends is directed towards stock repurchases. We continue to expect to spend approximately $500 million on acquisitions this year, including the Yara European carbon dioxide assets and the purchase of the remaining shares in our Yara-Praxair joint venture. Given that we anticipate more capital will be allocated towards accretive acquisitions, we have temporarily reduced our stock repurchases. Our project backlog, which we define as projects with CapEx greater than $5 million and associated with the fully executed customer supply contract, is currently $1.5 billion comprised of 17 projects. During the first quarter, we added a project located in the U.S. Gulf Coast region for expansion of carbon monoxide supply to the chemical end market and started projects in South America and Europe. Existing backlog projects will start up and contribute to growth during 2016 through 2018 as shown on Slide 13. North America continues to reflect about 55% in the backlog.","And now I will turn the call back to Matt to discuss our earnings guidance located on Slide #5.","Matt White","Before I jump into the numbers, I want to make a few comments about our foreign exchange rate assumptions. It\u2019s safe to say that FX markets are volatile and likely will remain that way for the foreseeable future. In years past, we were able to rely on spot and forward rates as good indicators for near-term future rates and thus incorporated them into our guidance. However, these have not proven to be very useful over the last several quarters, as many currencies seem to be trading more in binary events than fundamentals. Speculation on political decisions or interest rate increases can move currency rates several percentage points in one day. In light of this, our current second quarter guidance reflects the recently improved foreign currency spot rates, but the back half of the year uses rates closer to the first quarter average rates given the uncertainty.","For the second quarter guidance, we are estimating EPS in the range of $1.32 to $1.39. Sequentially, we are anticipating volumes to improve from a combination of seasonal patterns and current run rates from March. We still have some volume headwinds in specific end markets, but I anticipate prior year comparisons will ease by the second half. Looking at the full year, EPS guidance is in the range of $5.35 to $5.70. We raised the range $0.05 to account for updated currency impact for the first half, but we then took the top end back down $0.05 in light of the North American volume trends, primarily related to U.S. packaged gas volumes. I believe we have a few more quarters of this late cycle impact, which will reduce some of the upside potential for the next six months to nine months. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be $1.5 billion, which is consistent with our prior guidance. We continue to manage capital spending prudently, so I hope to improve on this number.","In summary, our first quarter ended a little better than expected. Some of the macroeconomic headwinds have started to stabilize, but one quarter doesn\u2019t make a trend. Overall, we are executing the strategy, optimize the base business, prudently allocate capital for profitable growth and manage the things within our control to create long-term intangible shareholder value.","I would now like to open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citigroup. Your line is now open.","P.J. Juvekar","Yes. Hi, good morning Matt.","Matt White","Good morning P.J.","P.J. Juvekar","As CapEx cycle slows down around the world, do you imagine a scenario that Praxair\u2019s backlog continues to decline, but your free cash flow improves and you can buyback more and more shares?","Matt White","Well, I would say looking at our CapEx spending, we continue to see based on current numbers, probably two-thirds of it roughly is associated with growth projects. So if the assumption were that large capital expenditures of our customers would either be delayed or deferred into future years, then yes, our free cash flow would continue to grow. And you have seen that over the last 18 months, frankly. We have had some very high free cash flow numbers and a lot of that\u2019s been attributed to the reduced CapEx spend. But when I do look at the project opportunities, we still do see some U.S. Gulf Coast, pretty large scale projects that we are working on diligently. So I would say, as the projects are coming in, they will be larger and lumpier than they have in the past. We are seeing projects that tend to be both process and atmospheric gases. So you tend to have larger investments than I would say some of the normal investments we have seen. But to your scenario, yes lower CapEx will mean higher free cash flow. And if we are not spending it on acquisitions, which are clearly another synergistic growth area for us, we will just continue to raise the dividends and use any excess for some buyback.","P.J. Juvekar","And as a follow-up, on coal to chemical projects in China, historically, I think Praxair was a bit more skeptical of those projects. I think you said that they are now ramping up and they are more \u2013 a bit more viable today and is that due to lower coal prices? Thank you.","Matt White","Well, since we are not participating in any, I will call it, at the mine of the mouth coal, especially coal to liquid, coal to synthetic natural gas or some of those coal to olefin projects in places like Inner Mongolia we are not in there. So, I can\u2019t speak to those projects specifically. To your point, we did not participate in those projects. But what I would say we are seeing on the ground in general is this. First of all, these are very high CapEx projects. They take a significant amount of capital for the gasifiers to basically gasify that coal and make whatever product you are looking to make. I think it\u2019s pretty clear and pretty well known that the liquidity situation for a lot of companies in China is not very strong. There has been a lot of stimulus that especially this most recent month or two that\u2019s not sustainable. So, our view is if the project is permitted, there is a good chance it should be finished and built. For project that\u2019s not permitted in this space, our belief is it probably will not get built in any foreseeable future. Then the question is, if it\u2019s built, will it run given the low coal price? And that\u2019s just the function, I think of the more profitable ones, with liquidity will run and the ones that may have some financial difficulties may or may not run. So, that remains to be seen. But our customers that we supply, they are large global chemical players. They are mostly in integrated parks. So, there is multiple integrated pet chem chain and they continue to run.","P.J. Juvekar","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Matt Andrejkovics","Hi, good morning. This is actually Matt Andrejkovics on for Vincent. Thanks for taking the call. Just in North America, the 1% price gain while volume was down 5%, what\u2019s driving that? Is that perhaps a mix shift because some of the volume decline was in the lower margin hardgoods?","Matt White","There maybe a little bit of that, that mix shift. We have been announcing price increases. North America is one of the few regions in the world, where they are publicly announced price increases. You may have seen some through the press releases. So, we are getting some price in merchant. We are getting some price in packaged. Clearly, there is a mix benefit with less hardgoods. However, there is also a mix hurt with less merchant going into energy and what\u2019s called supplemental liquid that would go into places like metals that may run stronger or liquid argon that may go into places like stainless steel. So, I would say on balance probably not a lot of mix effect, this is really more a function of the price increases. They are low single-digit. And then when we show our price, it has a function of the entire revenue. So, the number tends to always show a little lower, because you have onsite in the denominator and we don\u2019t count onsite as pricing. So, we are still getting low single-digit pricing in both packaged and merchant overall and this I think pretty much reflects that.","Matt Andrejkovics","Got it. Thanks. And then just to follow-up, are you seeing any pickup in packaged gas M&A post the pending Airgas deal and then have valuation ideas changed at all given the watermark that they have established? Thanks.","Matt White","Well, I would say from a valuation perspective, we haven\u2019t seen much change at all and we are not changing our criteria. So, I will start with that statement. Yes, we did a few last quarter three or four, we executed another three or so this quarter, all U.S. packaged gas. So, we continue to see some good, small synergistic tuck-in opportunities, very consistent with the rollup strategy we have been performing. Clearly, there are some headwinds in U.S. packaged gas today. That also presents some opportunities for acquisitions and it can make the valuations a little bit better. So, we continue to pursue that, but we are still well underway in some of our independent rollup strategy.","Matt Andrejkovics","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Harrison from Seaport Global Securities. Your line is now open.","Mike Harrison","Hi, good morning.","Matt White","Good morning, Mike.","Mike Harrison","Yes. I was hoping you kind of addressed this in your discussion about North America pricing, but can you just talk a little bit about what you are seeing in underlying supply and demand dynamics in LOX\/LIN and particularly in LAR as we see maybe some improving utilization at some of the steel customers.","Matt White","Sure. What I can start with were some of the headwinds we are facing and then talk a little bit about were some pickup. So, with LOX, one area that\u2019s a headwind there is you tend to have and I mentioned it earlier, supplemental oxygen on a liquid base as you can supply the steel mills. So, when steel mills run very hard, especially areas like tubular steel, they will actually take liquid in addition to any onsite oxygen they have. Clearly that, on a year-over-year basis is a headwind. Those volumes are definitely down. Similarly, LIN is the primary product that we put downhaul for fracturing in the Oilwell service business. And that from Canada to U.S. to Mexico is down significantly given the challenges in the upstream energy business and the low oil price. So, those are both down significantly in those end markets. Excluding those, we are starting to see some pickup, areas that are resilient like LIN for food, CO2, which I know you didn\u2019t ask about, but CO2 was actually growing quite well.","We have been securing a lot of sources for CO2, if that is a game that\u2019s all about very integrated supply chain and we are seeing a lot of strength there in food and beverage, especially things like our new CO2 business usage there for carbonated beverages. But other than that, we are seeing some moderate growth in LIN\/LOX when you exclude those two sort of cyclical demand areas. On the LAR front, stainless is a little bit down year-over-year. We had some strong stainless last year, so you have got some comps here lapping there and met fab is a little down, given the trends I spoke about in PDI. So from that perspective, I would say LAR is down a bit, but LAR is still tight overall. As you imagine, when you have onsite customers that are oxygen baseloads running lower, you have to make more premium argon. So, argon is still a tight product despite the volumes being down in some of the end markets. And then liquid hydrogen is something that continues to be quite strong. We are seeing a lot of applications there whether it\u2019s for space exploration or areas in some of the hydrogen powered things like fork trucks. So, hydrogen continues to be a pretty good growth product as well.","Mike Harrison","Alright. Thanks for the color there. And just in terms of the South America business, can you update us on what portion of your onsite customers are running below take-or-pay minimums? Thank you.","Matt White","Sure. So, I won\u2019t give a specific number, but consistent with what we have said in the prior quarters, we definitely do have some several steel customers that are running below and they continue to pay. This quarter is a little more difficult simply because you have carnival and you have summer holidays. So, we always tend to see a few more customers even on a normal year, excluding what\u2019s going on in the ground, did below MTOPs, similar to what you see in Asia with the Lunar New Year. So, that\u2019s more I will call seasonal dip. But primarily steel customers, they are paying. And as you have seen from our numbers, we did see some sequential improvements, especially from a very low December. So, I think that aspect has been pretty good. In fact, we had a couple of that were below MTOP last quarter and now they are above MTOP in Q1.","Mike Harrison","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Laurence Alexander","Good morning. To get the question on consolidation and I guess self-identity longer term, are there any regions where you see an opportunity to leapfrog, I am thinking similar to like what you started doing in the Middle East when you did the ROC acquisition in 2010 as competitors are whittling down portfolios? And related to that, how do you see sort of longer term opportunity, if any, in around as it opens up? ","Matt White","Okay. So, I will start on a high level. I think Laurence, we are constantly reviewing our geographic portfolio around the world to evaluate, do we have the density that we believe we need to achieve the type of returns in the quality and the reliability of the business model that we need. So that is always an ongoing effort. And as you stated, we entered into certain countries in the Middle East. And I would say the countries that we are in, we do have a fairly meaningful density model, but not where we want it to be and we are not participating in Saudi Arabia, which is the largest country in the Middle East. So we continue to evaluate Middle East and see what options we want to take there, but that\u2019s something our portfolio will always evaluate. Russia is another area, we have been building some density given the situation in Russia today. We slowed that process down, but we have built some pretty strong density in the Volga region as well as out in Ekaterinburg. And the assets that we do have on the ground there are running as expected and running fairly well. So those are two regions that we do see some opportunity to modify our portfolio one way or the other, but we will continue to evaluate that. As far as Iran, we will clearly work with the U.S. situation there and what they allow with companies. But to say the least, the Europeans will have a head start on that just given the U.S. relationship with Iran versus, I would say the European relationships will probably soften first. So we will keep our eye on it, but it will be tough I think for American companies to get in there before any European companies.","Laurence Alexander","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Bob Koort","Thanks. Good morning Matt.","Matt White","Good morning Bob.","Bob Koort","I was wondering if you could comment, Praxair areas is always well-regarded for your efficiency and productivity moves and I am wondering we have had a pretty extended malaise in a lot of your markets I assume will come into the end of what you can do, how many more levers can you guys pull if we stay in this sort of muddling along end markets environment?","Matt White","Well, I think Bob clearly, let\u2019s remember, we took out about 7% to 8% of the workforce here towards Q2, Q3 of last year. So we haven\u2019t quite even had the anniversary of that yet, but that was a series of actions we took. And frankly before we took that action, people were asking us that same question. What can we do, we have seemed to have run out of levers. I am not saying that we would go to another action of that nature. We feel that the actions we have taken are well in line with the market we are seeing. But I would also say that we continually look for productivity opportunities. As the markets change whether volumes go down or volumes go up, it makes new opportunities in our logistics management. You are seeing mill rates around the world change quite differently and it makes projects, in some cases more viable that we may not have done in prior years whether it\u2019s an increase in mill rates or in some cases the decrease in mill rates. And so as the dynamics change on these type of input costs for us, as the dynamics change in terms of the customers we serve, it can create new productivity opportunities that may not have given us a sufficient return under prior scenarios. So we are always looking at these changes. We are always trying to evaluate how long that they will be like this. And then we would attempt to take prudent actions. But we have had to have a lot of productivity just to sustain the margin levels we have had. As you know every time we lose volume, it falls at pretty high margins. So we need to take a lot of actions in productivity and pricing to negate that effect and that\u2019s what we have been doing. So we look to continue to do that. I am not anticipating any headcount action at this point given how we are seeing the markets. But I am anticipating we will continue to push productivity the way we always have and we will continue to try and find some opportunities around that.","Bob Koort","And if I could follow-up, do you have any sense of a changing dynamic in sort of the industry growth rates relative to GDP or industrial production on a go-forward basis relative to what we had in the last decade, I hear from some investors some concern that we had sort of a basic materials in emerging markets halo for the last decade that won\u2019t repeat and therefore, may be the growth rates of the industry have changed, what are your thoughts on that?","Matt White","Well, I think when we look at the growth rates from a high level, I still firmly believe it\u2019s consistent with how we have laid it out in prior years and I think how most of the industries laid it out in prior years. But the growth rates are really going to be a function of, I will call it four basic things if you are looking at the top line, it will be price. And price tends to be, in my mind, more tied towards inflation. So if we do see some inflation here that should help. We have seen in prior year with inflation. We have seen it in markets with inflation. It tends to be tied with acquisition activity. We are seeing more rollup opportunities in this environment and we are an example of some of the acquisitions we are doing. And then it\u2019s a function of both projects and organic volume. So on the project side, it\u2019s clear, backlogs are going down. Customers or potential customers are not making the capital investments they had. This is part of the cycle you see in the capital cycle. So that is something that if that returns or when that returns, especially in some industries that have been fairly muted for a while, like mining, heavy equipment and areas like that, that will give growth. But if that doesn\u2019t return anytime soon, then that will be an area of growth that will still be a little sluggish. And then finally to your point, is this organic that we usually used IP as a proxy. And to your point, what we have always found is emerging markets IP multiples, almost always tend to be stronger than developed market IP growth multiples. And it makes logical sense, because in an emerging market it tends to be more infrastructure related growth. You tend to have a lot more application related growth. That gets to that whole intensity of industrial gas per capita and that is a real thing we see. So when the emerging markets slowed and the commodity markets slowed, you saw a portion of the backlog projects be reduced as customers didn\u2019t spend money. You saw the highest IP multiple markets be reduced, in fact all negative and the combination of those things really did make the, call growth algorithm weaker. But the question is do you believe emerging markets are out forever, I personally don\u2019t believe that. I think we are in cycles like any other cycles. Some of the issues we have today are demand driven. There are one or two that might be supply driven. But when it does rebound, you get back to those multiples you have seen and in prior years. Developed markets in my mind, tend to be more closer to IP, a little bit above IP, but that\u2019s kind of how I view it. So those are the factors of growth. And right now, yes we are in a position where a lot of people are not making investment. Emerging markets are struggling and that\u2019s created some dampening effect on the growth. But I do expect that will recover and return, when, I don\u2019t know. But we have seen these cycles in the past.","Bob Koort","Great. Thanks for your thoughts.","Operator","Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Duffy Fischer","Yes. Good morning. First question just around currency, if we actually held currencies constant with where they are at today what would be the delta in the back half where we are actually using more of a Q1 estimate?","Matt White","Yes. Duffy, I can maybe put that this way because I don\u2019t want to throw a bunch of numbers out there, given just the complete uncertainty. I mean as you know, June will be another Fed decision. So our view is basically that we felt, I will use the word comfortable enough to take spot rates and some forward rates as they stood a few weeks ago to call it for Q2. Come June, kind of all bets are off because we just don\u2019t know what could happen with the Fed decision. And frankly, we don\u2019t know what will happen tomorrow, let alone come June. But clearly if rates are better our spot rates hold, all de novo is equal, we will have better EPS than what the guidance says and that\u2019s holding our people. So there clearly is some upside. I would rather not get into numbers because what spot rates, what day, what currency, there is a lot of moving parts there. But you could probably do the math from what you get from our 10-Q we will file, you will see what the average rates were and then you could plug in whatever spot rate assumption you want, it probably would be a fairly rough proxy but it will be \u2013 it can get you close enough.","Duffy Fischer","Okay, thanks. And then in general, historically when hardgoods have diverged this much from the underlying gases, were the hardgoods of the leading indicator or the lag indicator?","Matt White","Yes. We always go around on this internally. My opinion is this. The equipment portion of hardgoods does tend to be a leading indicator. Clearly, if people stop buying large automated equipment, if our customers are not confident in their backlog of growth prospects, they will not invest in new capital equipment, so we saw that drop off first over the last, I will call it nine months or so. What we are seeing now is some of the equipment, but also just consumables. And consumables in my mind tend to move with gas to an extent as far as how they drop. If you need less shielding gas, you probably use less contact tips, you use less wire those things tend to run together. So, I would say at this point we have already seen some of the leading indicators on equipment and now we are kind of just seeing with gas in the consumables kind of down together.","Duffy Fischer","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial. Your line is now open.","Emily Wagner","Good morning. This is actually Emily Wagner on for Don. We are wondering if you could discuss the underlying tone of business in Brazil, have you seen any impact from the Petrobras scandal on your project or is it more of slow oil impact?","Matt White","Yes. So, we don\u2019t have any projects with Petrobras. In fact, we have very, very little business directed to Petrobras. What I would say the impact of the carwash situation and the Petrobras situation in general is just in an overall kind of paralysis on any industrial investment. I mean, Petrobras, like the Pemex in Mexico, is a very, very big part of the economy. It creates a very large supplier chain network of many various industrial companies that supply Petrobras directly and indirectly. So, there are many customers that we supply that supply Petrobras. And clearly, they are not doing as well. A perfect example, a steel company that makes tubular steel, they are not making much anymore given Petrobras. But in my mind, the situation on that has been baked into our results for a year now. That\u2019s \u2013 they are sort of negative reaction from carwash and some of the curtailment in their activity has already been reflected in several quarters.","I think when you look at Brazil now question we get is what\u2019s going on with the potential impeachment? Would that make any difference? And right now, we just don\u2019t know, we just don\u2019t know. Clearly, the financial markets have been reacting positively. If you look at the real, if you look at the Bovespa, but we haven\u2019t seen much industrial change yet. But I would say, on an overall basis, the fact that they are trying to rude out layers of corruption is a good thing and that should position them well for a long-term improvement in the economy. And we are seeing some positive developments in Argentina with Macri coming in, with his ability to resolve some of the bond situation his ability to issue bonds is creating a positive effect and renewed interest in Argentina. So, I hope with Brazil, we can get over this hump, but it\u2019s going to still take time to play out and we will have to see. We are not anticipating much recovery in Brazil this year and we will have to reevaluate for next year based on how we see the next few quarters play out.","Emily Wagner","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Sheehan from SunTrust. Your line is now open.","James Sheehan","Thank you. Could you comment on the situation in Europe give us a little color on what you are seeing in sort of the sub-regions there? Where we are seeing kind of a gradual macro recovery and yet your volumes haven\u2019t really picked up. So, when would you expect to see any improvement in organic growth in Europe?","Matt White","Yes. So, we have been seeing, I will call it slow and steady improvement, but very incremental. We have had project pickup. On an organic volume basis, we have been seeing some good strength in Spain. Italy has not been as strong, but I would say overall, for Europe, it\u2019s kind of continued to improve slowly, where we have the biggest headwind right now has been in our upstream energy business primarily around the North Sea and that has been a continual headwind. That\u2019s really offsetting some of the organic growth rates in the rest of Continental Europe. So, I would say when you exclude that upstream energy, we are getting organic growth in addition to our project contribution. So, that part has been good. And you see some of it in the margins as well as we have been able to get the value of that volume contribution and capture with some improved margins. I would say Scandinavia in general is a little weaker as you would imagine given it\u2019s an oil-based economy. We continue to see interest and investments and strong volumes in Port of Antwerp area, which would make sense given the euro is a little weaker, given oil is a little lower and see shipping costs are much lower. And that really helps the competitiveness of that pet chem enclave.","And in Southern Europe, like I mentioned, Spain has continued to improve here. We will have to see with the election situation where that ends up, but it\u2019s still been improving. Our medical business, which we have a fairly large medical business is quite strong across all of Europe. In fact, we just did some recent acquisitions, one in Italy in the medical and also the NOxBOX, which was UK which will serve more global. So, that has been good. And I would say, in general in Russia, the onsite assets we have are running well as our customers are globally competitive, especially at this lower ruble. And the merchant business and packaged business is somewhat soft as you would expect in a stag inflationary economy, which they still are today. So in general, the Northern in Benelux is doing well, Southern doing well, Scandinavia is weak, Russia on the ground is still a little weak and anything upstream energy is quite weak, but slow and steady improvement is the general view we have.","James Sheehan","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Roberts from UBS Securities. Your line is now open.","John Roberts","Thank you. Do you have regulatory approval yet on that GE JV? And are there any modeling changes that we should be aware of here? I believe you have majority interest, so there is no change to revenues. I assume the minority interest line will be material?","Matt White","Yes. So, we hope to finalize that here in a few months. So, we are still going through the last remaining requirements. I don\u2019t anticipate any significant obstacles on that. We would still consolidate it, but to your point there would be a minority interest impact with that JV structure. So, that is \u2013 yes, that would be the way to model it. Inversely with Yara, we would take what today is a minority interest impact and that would go away with the consolidation of the JV and then with the Yara CO2 that would obviously be just a brand new consolidated acquisition. And with the Yara version, we just have one more real regulatory hurdle here that we are not overly concerned about, which should be fine. So, I expect both of those buyback into Q2. Hopefully, it should be finalized, but you never know what the timing, so we just need to keep it open.","John Roberts","Okay. And is there a material part of your North America onsite business that\u2019s at minimum take-or-pay volumes?","Matt White","North America, I would say, metals, there are few metals customers that will be below take-or-pay. I will say that we are getting paid in all of them around the world frankly, we are getting paid, but a few in metals. And some when you see turnarounds in the golf, but again, that\u2019s more seasonal as their turnarounds, they fall below and we see that each turnaround season. So, there is no concern on that front.","John Roberts","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Sison from KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Mike Sison","Hey, nice start to the year there. In terms of South America, volumes being down 2%, I just wanted to get a better feel for how that sort of flushes through. It sounds like your industrial businesses are doing worse and the growth in the healthcare is doing really well. So, is the industrial part kind of more in line with the Brazil industrial production, you noted down 12% and you kind of have double-digits from healthcare and food and beverages driving the outperformance?","Matt White","Well, we do have double-digits from food and healthcare, probably 10%, 15% kind of growth rates. On the metals, yes, it\u2019s dropping at a rate, I would say consistent, if not more than industrial production, but remember, we have take-or-pay structures. So, they will mitigate that from a contractual standpoint. So, what we are seeing is from my view, on the industrial site, the customer volume levels are fairly consistent with what you are seeing in the overall results, but our contract structure helps mitigate that. And then on the more resilient industries, we continue to see very strong results. And when you add that together plus the price, you are getting with some of the inflation impacts there. It is allowing the organic growth to still be fairly respectable. But we still need more work in that area. As I mentioned, we are still going to work more on the pricing side. And we will have to see how volumes fare out in these coming quarters, but so far with April as expected coming out of the March results.","Mike Sison","Okay. And one quick one on Yara, is that included in the guidance or I mean is that potentially upside?","Matt White","I would say, in general we have Yara encapsulated more back half. I would anticipate much contribution in Q2 here. But from a back half perspective, we are accounting for a general bucket of the acquisitions and I would say, Yara is one of them. But so yes, it would be in there.","Mike Sison","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks very much. The industrial gas companies tend to have about 1% year-over-year price increase, is that price increase pretty evenly distributed across all of your industry end markets or does it turn out that it\u2019s more concentrated in certain ones where Europe pricing is maybe above 1% and then in certain areas, your pricing is below, I realized that you have different geographies that you sell to, so maybe if you could discuss that in terms of the United States?","Matt White","Okay, yes. Because my first answer would have been the pricing is more geographic dependent in a lot of cases as we know. So with in the U.S., I would say and we had this discussion a little bit earlier, there will be some mix effect that could influence that when you have some higher margin sales that are going away and we have seen some of that. So that could negatively influence that. But I would say pricing is still very, very regional, within a couple of hundred mile radius and it tends to be a function of any contracts that may be renewing and\/or new opportunities that could be coming up in that region. And it will just be a function of the product supply available for that. But it\u2019s very, very small transaction by transaction and that\u2019s why every time we continue to look at this, what we tend to see is at the top of the house, inflation tends to be a fairly good proxy for it. There are some regional differences that could be driven either by geographic differences even within the U.S., right where product might be tight or on the looser. And there could be some industry perspectives where for example a certain end market may get extreme high value out of the product and the pricing might be a little better than say another end market where there are alternate substitutes, maybe different than industrial gas. So from that perspective, I would say it is not too different than what you may see in other industries. But given that contractual nature and given the proximity of supply, really on the top of the house, inflation still tends to be a good proxy in my mind.","Jeff Zekauskas","So if your category in the United States was called a price mix instead of price and you have the 1%, how would you divide it in terms of price and mix?","Matt White","Yes. I would rather not go down there, Jeff. How people define mix of itself is a whole another equation. So we tend to do straight volume on molecules and then the balance goes there which we consider mix because there is customer mix and there is product mix, right, so there is two types of sharing. So rather than getting into that on this call, let\u2019s just say it\u2019s all in there.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay. Thank you so much, Matt.","Matt White","Okay. I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Our final question comes from Christopher Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Christopher Parkinson","Perfect. Thank you very much. You have clearly made some efforts to increase your exposure in food and beverage, healthcare, some other defensible end markets, naturally some of the cyclicals in manufacturing has been weaker on a relative basis, but when you look at your end market portfolio 2 years to 3 years down the road, does that all tie into your views of regional growth and how should we thing about this when you look at your, let\u2019s say large project backlog versus your own desire to end market exposure or do you simply just think about it 100% from a return perspective? Thank you.","Matt White","Sure. Clearly we continue to look at every market and we continue to look at it from a return perspective and an opportunity set. So our focus on Brazilian markets doesn\u2019t mean we are ignoring industrial markets. What it really means is this. When we look out at least in the near-term and it\u2019s no surprise that there is a bit of a commodity and an emerging market retrenchment going on right now, that some of these more cyclical markets could take some time before they will show any new growth opportunities, right. A rebound of lows, were already connected to them. Our pipe is already there. Our tank is already there. So coming off of a low and rebounding we will just automatically get without focusing or without investment, right. They are still under contract. So there is no worries that the rebound we wouldn\u2019t be capturing. The focus is more on new investments. So where is money being spent today, there is a good amount being spent in some of these resilient areas. The growth trajectories in those resilient areas are greater, excluding the rebound effect on some of the more cyclicals. So that\u2019s why our focus has been there. But it doesn\u2019t mean we are not focusing on all the growth opportunities we have. For example, in South America, we still see some opportunities for decapping in some areas that would be cyclical.","And we have done that in the 90s and it was very successful for us. And we will do it again now. So those kind of things continue to happen. But when we look at healthcare, we look at food and beverage. We look at some consumer related end markets like refining and electronics, they are growing well. We are focusing our applications technology, our sales force and even some of our acquisitions towards those resilient markets. And they will give us a nice compounded growth that\u2019s more based on either demographics or more resilient trends than kind of ups and downs that we will see in some cycles. So the view is if we have more focus on there, we get those compound growth rate and cycles return, you can get a pretty strong growth and a growth rate that is a little more stable. So that\u2019s how we have been doing it. By no means do we regret any of the exposures we have had. They have served us quite well and they continue to service well. It\u2019s just that the growth opportunities in those areas are not as great right now, in this current environment.","Christopher Parkinson","That\u2019s all I had. Thank you very much.","Matt White","You\u2019re welcome.","Kelcey Hoyt","Okay. Thanks again for participating in our first quarter earnings call. And if you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me directly. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Juan Pelaez, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Juan Pelaez - Praxair, Inc.","Thanks, Vicki. Good morning, and thank you for attending our first quarter earnings call and webcast. I am joined this morning by Matt White, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Kelcey Hoyt, Vice President and Controller.","Today's presentation materials are available on our website at praxair.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference.","In addition please note that year-over-year and sequential comparisons exclude first quarter transaction costs related to the proposed merger and previously disclosed adjustments in 2016. The reconciliation to the U.S. GAAP reported numbers are in the appendix of this presentation and the press release.","Matt and I will now review Praxair's first quarter results, including the current business environment and updated earnings guidance. We'll then be available to answer questions.","I'd like now to turn the call over to Matt.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Thanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Overall, we had a solid quarter and delivered on key initiatives from our core strategy. We have finally lapped many significant headwinds in foreign currency, upstream energy a and other industrial markets, which enabled us to grow volumes 4% from broad-based support in almost every end market.","In fact the actual results came in above our guidance range due to better foreign currencies and stronger than anticipated volumes in North America and Asia. In addition we continue to see attractive project opportunities in the U.S. Gulf Coast, as we announced the new contract with Celanese and expect additional wins in the coming months.","Turning to slide 4. I'll now briefly walk around the world to provide some color on the trends that we're seeing in our key end markets.","North America, which is the largest segment, saw high single digit to double digit growth rates across refining, chemicals, and metals customers. First quarter of last year was a difficult environment, but we've had nice recovery from our highly competitive customers, who tend to run some of the lowest-cost plants in their respective markets. Both the onsite and merchant business units have continued to grow each of the last several quarters, as the commodity and industrial declines have subsided.","In addition the project activity in the U.S. Gulf Coast continues to be highly active. As the petrochemical industry builds out, there are more industrial gas opportunities throughout the supply chain. And our strong track record of high reliability and competitive cost from a dense supply network has enabled us to secure several new customer contracts and letters of intent.","Our packaged gas business, which tends to lag in economic cycles, has stabilized this quarter with March as one the strongest months we've seen in almost a year.","Hardgoods volumes are still down a few percentage points year over year. But gas volumes have stabilized and were slightly positive in the month of March. This trend mirrors the U.S. industrial production figures, which steadily improved throughout the quarter. Time will tell on future packaged trends, but we have lapped some of the more difficult prior year comps.","The South American segment, at 14% of sales, continues to be the most challenging region in the world. Approximately 20% of this region relates to the smaller Hispanic countries, which are either stable or performing better, such as Argentina and Peru. However, Brazil makes up the majority of this segment, and the industrial end markets are still very weak.","Over the last several quarters, a combination of increases, large project startups, and continued strength from resilient and consumer end market growth has helped mitigate the significant decline and negative mix of lower volumes to every industrial and commodity related end market.","While we are starting to lap some of the positive contributors, the underlying conditions have worsened, as evidenced by the most recent negative industrial production number. Therefore, we anticipate continued weakness in Brazil for the remainder of the year, and are taking appropriate actions in line with that environment.","The European segment has been steadily improving over the last few years. Organic volumes grew mid-single digit this quarter across all end markets, except for upstream energy, with particular strength in chemicals, from our recent investment in the Port of Antwerp, as well as health care, food, and beverage. We are seeing positive growth across all supply modes of on-site, merchant, and packaged.","Our recent acquisition of the CO2 business has been integrating well and contributing mid to high single digit sales growth rates from prior year. Even though we will lap the acquisition impact by the middle of this year, I anticipate Europe will continue to grow organic volumes.","Turning to Asia. Volumes grew almost 10% from prior year, due to higher base volumes in on-site and merchant, and the impact of project startups in Korea and China. The three biggest end markets driving the growth were metals, electronics, and chemicals.","Even though steel capacity is being rationalized throughout China, we are very well positioned with the most competitive Tier 1 producers. Electronics and chemicals continue to be areas of investment, driving both current volumes as well as future project opportunities. While pricing trends are still flat to negative, especially related to helium and certain rare gases, our prior cost actions have significantly helped improve operating margins.","Wrapping up with PST. Trends have been fairly consistent, with double digit growth in aerospace coating volumes being mostly offset by weakness in the industrial and energy markets, specifically for industrial gas turbine coatings.","Our GE partnership is progressing well, as demand for aircraft engines remains quite high, supporting our current investments for future capacity.","Based on these global trends, we are starting to see some signs of volume recovery, which is evident in our top line sales trends. But more importantly, the positive impact is also evident on cash flow trends, which you can find on slide 5.","First quarter operating cash flow of $710 million was 28% above last year, and 26% of sales. In fact, this was our highest first quarter operating cash flow ever. In line with the strategy, employees around the world are managing all aspects of operating cash flow. And the positive results have been clear.","Furthermore, efforts to control capital spending have enabled $383 million of free cash flow this quarter, which is 67% higher than prior year. The free cash flow was used to fund dividends and pay down approximately $170 million of debt.","Due to the proposed merger with Linde, we have ceased all stock repurchases. We will continue to reevaluate this position in light of the events and information made available throughout the process.","Before I hand it off to Juan, I'd like to provide a brief update on the proposed merger. I'm sure some of you have read various publications and news articles providing specific details of the merger, but many of those are simply speculation. Any company-provided sources of information will be filed appropriately with the regulators. At this stage, we have the non-binding term sheet executed on December 20, which lays out the terms of a potential agreement.","Furthermore, each company has provided some limited publicly disclosed updates. We are still actively working toward a definitive agreement. And we'll have a clear and concise joint communication plan when that is executed. All relevant details, including Q&A opportunities, will be available at that time.","However, both parties still must finalize negotiations and prepare fairly laborious filing requirements. These efforts take time, but we have made good progress, and we'll provide the necessary details as soon as practicable. Until then, I appreciate your patience and understanding that we are not in a position at this time to field questions on the proposed merger.","I'd now like to hand it off to Juan to review the first quarter results.","Juan Pelaez - Praxair, Inc.","Thanks, Matt. Now please turn to slide 6 for our consolidated results. Overall sales were $2.7 billion, 9% higher than last year, and 3% higher sequentially. The year-over-year sales growth was mostly driven from 4% volume growth in North America, Europe, and Asia, including new projects, partially offset by South America, primarily due to weaker economic activity in Brazil.","Price contributed 1% growth and was achieved largely in North America. Acquisitions, mainly in Europe, also contributed 1% growth to sales. Positive currency impact increased sales by another 1%. And higher cost pass-through, primarily driven by higher natural gas prices passed through to hydrogen customers, increased sales by 2%.","We continue to see solid growth out of the more resilient end markets globally, along with higher volumes in metals, downstream energy, chemicals, and electronics.","Sequentially, volumes were up 2% versus the fourth quarter, driven by North America manufacturing and downstream energy and Europe healthcare manufacturing.","By operating segment, North America sales increased 8% year over year and 4% sequentially. Excluding cost pass through, sales were up 5% above the prior year quarter, primarily due to 3% higher volumes to metals, downstream energy, and chemicals end markets, and 1% higher pricing. Additionally, acquisitions, primarily packaged gas distributors in the United States, contributed to 1% growth.","Sequentially, organic growth in manufacturing and metals customers was partially offset by lower volumes in upstream energy, mainly in Canada, which lagged the declines previously experienced in the U.S. and Mexico.","In Europe, sales grew 11% year over year and up 1% sequentially. Year-over-year growth was primarily driven by volumes growing 6% and the acquisition of a carbon dioxide business, largely serving the food and beverage market. Volume growth was mainly driven by sales to chemicals, food and beverage, manufacturing, and metals and continued project contribution in Antwerp. Sequentially, volume increased 2% from manufacturing and metals end markets.","South America sales grew 19% year over year, mainly driven by 18% currency tailwind. Price attainment was 1% due to mix and from lower inflation, which has fallen for the seventh consecutive month to the lowest rate since August 2010.","Year-over-year volumes were flat as growth from new project contributions, food and beverage and health care was offset by negative volumes in the manufacturing end market in Brazil. Sequentially, excluding positive currency of 4%, (12:02) grew 1% from underlying volumes as fourth quarter base volumes were weaker due to extended holiday shutdowns.","Sales in Asia were up 5% year over year. Excluding a prior year net divestiture, currency, and cost pass-through, sales grew 8%, driven by higher volumes in China (12:22), India, and Korea. This (12:25) growth was primarily electronics, metals, and chemicals end markets, including project startups, mainly in Korea and China. Price was down 1%, mostly related to helium and certain rare gases.","Sequentially, volumes declined 1% due to the seasonal impact of the Lunar New Year.","Surface Technologies sales were up 1% year over year and sequentially, driven by growth in aerospace coating volumes.","Operating profit of $588 million was up 6% from the prior year, driven by higher volumes and price. Operating margin was 21.6%. And EBITDA margin was 32.5%. Cost pass-through doesn't materially impact operating profit dollars but did dilute margins by 40 basis points.","Earnings per share of $1.37 was up 7% versus prior year quarter. Our project backlog, which we define as projects with CapEx greater than $5 million and associated with a fully executed customer supply contract, is currently $1.5 billion, comprised of 16 projects, mainly in the U.S. Gulf Coast.","This backlog includes a recently announced win in the U.S. Gulf Coast, where we will supply carbon monoxide, nitrogen, and oxygen to Celanese, starting up in 2020. Our carbon monoxide plant will also produce hydrogen, which we'll use to supply our growing pipeline network in the region.","We expect existing backlog projects to start up and contribute to growth from 2017 through 2020, as shown on slide 14. Today, North America reflects about 80% of that backlog.","Now I'll turn the call back to Matt to discuss our earnings guidance on slide 7.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Second quarter guidance, excluding potential merger costs, estimates EPS in the range of $1.38 to $1.43. This does not assume any material currency impact and thus represents approximately 1% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. During the second quarter we will lap many of the acquisitions and projects from 2016, yet we don't get the benefit of 2017 projects until the second half of this year.","The combination of this effect, coupled with a weaker Brazil, has led us to guide to this range. In addition this guidance assumes that the elevated volumes in Asia and North America from the first quarter do not continue into the second quarter. So that could represent some upside if those trends carry over.","For full year the EPS range is $5.55 to $5.80. We raised the bottom $0.10 and thus the midpoint, $0.05, from prior range in light of the stronger first quarter and better currency. But tempered that with the unfavorable trends in Brazil. Our initial outlook didn't assume much improvement in Brazil, but current conditions are still weaker than expected, which now have been updated.","The range also includes approximately 1% of FX headwind, since the second half comps get more difficult due to the 2016 stronger rates. The end result is a mid-single digit EPS growth rate, which is consistent with our prior outlook.","While first quarter volume trends were mostly better than anticipated, we need to be prudently cautious looking ahead. The political landscape is still uncertain with the impact of key European elections and specific U.S. legislation. We'll need to see more industrial activity on the ground before considering the positive volume trends as sustainable.","But regardless of the political and economic climate, the global Praxair team will continue to drive for the consistent performance and high quality results that our shareholders have become accustomed to.","As I mentioned earlier, before we open up the line, I just want to remind everyone that we don't have any further comments to make on the proposed merger. So I appreciate your efforts to refrain from asking any questions on this topic.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you. Within Brazil you highlighted the continued weakness in industrial end markets, but some strength in F&B and health care as we've seen over the last years. So can you just comment on what you're seeing on a sequential basis in the more heavy industries? And what you're hearing from customers? And then also do you expect any moderation in the F&B and health care in the back half? Thank you.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Sure, Chris. So sequentially, a little bit better, but that tends to be seasonal. What you tend to see in the fourth quarter are a lot of holiday related extended shutdowns, which we did see. So when we went sequential, there was a little bit of seasonality improvement. But I'd say nothing beyond that.","And I think the challenges we're finding in Brazil is that the underlying conditions just are not getting better. In fact, if you looked at the February industrial production number, it was almost negative 1% year over year. So still slightly eroding.","And as you may recall, we had several startups in South America through the back end 2015 into 2016. And we're going to start lapping those. We had some pretty strong pricing actions that were more than offsetting a lot of the unfavorable mix. And we've been seeing negative mix in Brazil with significant lower volumes in some of our better products like Argon and some of the more manufacturing related type products.","So what's happening now is as inflation continues to drop, the pricing is just not enough to offset this negative mix. We're lapping the projects. And the underlying conditions simply aren't improving. So we're seeing pretty much kind of a flat environment, despite obviously, the currency tailwind that we're now getting.","So that's the situation in Brazil. Obviously, there's still a lot of issues going on in the political environment. People are still being convicted, going to jail. And I think that's still putting a lot of uncertainty there. So we're just going to have to work through this. And frankly, we never did anticipate much from Brazil when we started this year. But unfortunately, that looked to be even too optimistic. So we'll have to work through it.","But we are taking actions to mitigate. We've taken a few already. And we'll probably take some more. And then the Hispanic countries are continuing to run well. So at least, while 20% of the region, they should hopefully offset a little bit of the Brazil weaker performance.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And turning to something a little more positive. Can you just give us comment on the trends you're seeing in Europe? Especially around your comments around any potential effect from the election season? And then also offer an update on the CO2 acquisition, how we should think about contributions in the back half? Thank you.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Sure. So starting with just Europe based volumes. And as you probably know, we are not (19:42) in France of any significance. We exited our industrial gas presence in France.","But what we're seeing is both Spain and Germany continue to be quite strong. We're seeing very good volumes coming out of those two countries. And Italy seems to be improving with each successive quarter. So the combination of those three have been quite strong.","Our Port of Antwerp assets are running very hard. We actually have another one coming on stream here soon. That's also been and continues to be a very good area for our volumes.","Clearly, the CO2 acquisition is adding from an acquisition basis. This is the lower point in the season, being the kind of cooler months. So that will ramp up seasonally in the summer months, as it does, and you get more volumes. And by default you get a little bit better variable margin for the region.","The weaker parts continue to be upstream energy. Anything in the North Sea, really not much activity. All the offshore platforms we've supplied are still at quite low levels. And the Nordics are not improving, not declining, but fairly flat. Again given that oil-based economy, we're just not seeing a lot of activity.","So somewhat consistent with what we've seen. But Southern Europe and parts of Antwerp and Germany continue to grow quite well.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Michael Sison with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, guys. Nice start to the year there.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Thanks, Mike.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Matt, in terms of North America, can you give us a feel for the volume growth by method? Meaning just maybe liquid and PDI and onsite?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Sure. So \u2013 and I'm assuming you mean year over year on that, Mike, right?","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Year over year, right.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","So refining, downstream energy, very strong. You may recall that fourth quarter, we had some turnarounds that we anticipated. And they all came out of turnaround. And we had a very strong downstream refining, which helped pretty significantly. Chemicals as well has been running quite well for us in North America, and these are all on the onsite.","The upstream oil, we've pretty much lapped everywhere, with the exception of Canada. You may recall we talked about Canada had held on stronger for quite some time. And now we're seeing, as expected, the declines there. So while we've lapped the U.S. and Mexico for the most part, probably a quarter or two left on Canada.","For merchant, continues to improve. It's improved several quarters in a row. Clearly a good portion of that is the food, the beverage, health care. We've seen improvements in manufacturing on the merchant. It's been slower on the packaged side to get the manufacturing climbing back. But the merchant has started to see pickups there. So I'd say on merchant, it's been pretty broad-based as well.","Packaged, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we each month got a little bit better. And March was the best month we've had in quite some time. Gas is now slightly positive. Hardgoods, kind of low single digit down, almost mid-single digit down. And that's a pretty standard kind of recovery pattern we've seen in the past.","So we'll have to see if these trends continue on the packaged. But we've been getting sequentially better each month and each quarter here. And hopefully that will bode well for some of the manufacturing environment.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. And as a quick follow-up, I understand your maybe cautiousness in terms of the sustainability of the volume growth at these levels. But in the event it does stay at these levels and maybe overall industrial demand continues to improve, would you be more toward your high end of your outlook, if volumes are here?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Yes. We would be definitely more towards the high end if we maintained these run rates.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Matt, you had nice volume growth in the United States and Europe, but very little positive operating leverage. That is, the incremental margins in both jurisdictions were lower. And even if you correct for the higher natural gas pass-through, still the margins are pretty low.","And if you look at your cost of goods sold year over year, it's up almost 13%, on 8% to 9% sales growth. Like there seems to be some cost issue that you're \u2013 or newer cost issue that you're facing. And of course pricing is very difficult to come by. So can you talk about why there wasn't more margin expansion in the U.S. and Europe? And some of the general cost price issues that you face?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Sure. And I'll stick to year over year, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sure. Thank you.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","So I think, to try and isolate it on a cost of goods sold, it gets a little bit complicated, because that includes the pass-through, right?","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sure.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","So I think it's probably better to just take it straight on the margin. And to your point...","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Last year, we were 25.8% in North America; this year, 24.5%. So a decline there, about 130 basis points. A little more \u2013 almost 100 basis points of that is pass-through.","As you know, North America has the most significant hydrogen-based assets. And natural gas has come up about $1 year over year. So the majority of that decline actually is the pass-through of both natural gas, and then there's a little bit of power as well.","So you really need to explain maybe 30 basis points, 40 basis points of softness, and that's pretty much the packaged business. As you know, the packaged business still hasn't recovered to levels of last year. Like I said, hardgoods is still down. Gas was positive for the month of March, but that, not really a positive for the quarter. So we're a little bit still softer there.","And then there's a little bit of helium price. Helium is more of a factor in Asia, frankly, but helium pricing is lower. That's not a secret, as you know, across the world. And some of that helium pricing has weighed a little bit on North America.","So those three factors are driving actually more than the decline of what's going on. And it's just something we've got to work on, to try and get back to the levels that we've seen. I think you had a question on \u2013 what was it? Europe as well?","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","On Europe. Yeah.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","So Europe, there's a little bit of pass-through. But that's not that significant. I'd say there's two primary drivers in Europe. The first one, there's a little bit of FX mix issue going on there. As the ruble strengthens, we actually have, if you may recall, our contracts denominated in euros in Russia. That was to protect ourselves from a very volatile currency. So that will create a little bit of mix effect on the currency.","But the bigger impact is really the acquisitions. So the acquisitions are a bit dilutive. Two reasons. One, we're ramping up the synergies. But number two, since it's mostly food and beverage, it's a very seasonal business. So what tends to happen is, during the down season, the margins will drop, simply because you don't have the same volumes. During the high season, which tend to be the warmer months in the summer, the margins go higher, because you're selling significant amounts of CO2.","So this effect will actually have almost a seasonal margin effect, to a little bit larger degree, in Europe than we had in the past.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then you had $105 million deferred tax benefit in your cash flow statement. Do you keep that through the year or does that go away?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Well, actually, I think that's other and \u2013 if you're talking about deferred income taxes and other?","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","If you're looking at the cash statement, the one \u2013 yeah.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","So it actually \u2013 what that includes, and you'll find that in the Q. So we had a $65 million dividend from one of our non-consolidated joint ventures this quarter. And it represented almost two years' worth, because the JV was unable to pay dividends until this period, due to some debt that was paid down on third party. So going forward, we'd expect probably half of that each year going forward. But that was one of the drivers and you'd find that in the Q.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you so much.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. And good morning.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Morning.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Matt, just wondering, you referenced sort of the better than expected volume and don't want to get too far ahead of yourself sustainability. I'm just thinking through looking at the balance of the chemicals industry and then parts of industrials that have already reported this year. Some companies also far downstream from you have reported better than expected volume. And they seem to indicate that some of that was a function of their customers who are really far downstream, loading up ahead of price increases, given that we're back in a pre-inflationary environment.","So I recognize I just took you really far away from your plans. But are you at all concerned that some of the strong volume growth in the quarter was just sort of that impact of downstream, product loading, and the inflationary environment? And then you might have to reverse it a bit later in the year?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Well, I guess I would look at it this way. I mean as I mentioned, we're not assuming it continues. So we'll start with that.","But secondly, when you look at the end market slide that we have in the backup, it's pretty broad based, right? I mean the only market that did not grow for us is manufacturing. And it was really driven by the U.S. packaged and our Brazilian operations. But pretty much every end market that we serve has been growing mid to high single digit across the world.","And when I look at my supply modes, both onsite and merchant are growing quite well pretty much everywhere in the world, except Brazil. And packaged, aside from the U.S., is doing fairly well across various geographies.","So it's more broad-based than it feels like some kind of just loading of certain industries or certain end markets. Clearly, we'll have to see. We don't know, hence, why we're trying to be somewhat cautious into our outlook. But we'll just have to see what comes in the next few quarters.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Good morning.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Morning, Laurence.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","I guess two quick ones. First, can you give a little bit more detail on what you're seeing in the electronics industry?","Secondly, can you give a little bit of an update on how you're thinking about packaged gas consolidation in North America? And the chance of picking off some of the super regionals once demand trends improve?","And then I guess if you can also maybe just touch on whether you see packaged and merchant pricing shifting to positive year-over-year comps in the back half of the year in each of the regions?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Okay. So electronics first, more Asia than anywhere else. And probably most of our growth, I'd say close to two-thirds, was more on the display side, things like OLED, AMOLED doing quite well. We've had a startup here in Korea for the largest cellphone manufacturer there.","And also had some pretty good activity in China for our electronics business. So I'd say that more of it tends to be more on the display side, but it's going quite well for us there.","For packaged on the North American consolidation, and you've probably heard it, Laurence, I think in some other calls, things are getting expensive. You saw this quarter we really didn't do any acquisitions. We still have our backlog. We're still looking at opportunities. But we need to find a multiple that works for us on a synergy based return. And if it doesn't reach our threshold, then we'll pass.","So we'll just have to see what happens there. But we do have opportunities in our backlog, but it's got to be the right price and it's got to be the right fit for us.","And then just on I guess packaged and merchant pricing. And you can see by region what we're seeing. We did get some pricing in North America here. As inflation starts stepping up, hopefully that number will improve. Europe, still challenged to get some price and a little bit negative mix there. Asia, it's mostly a helium and rare gas issue right now. Neon pricing, you probably heard, quite strong last year, not as strong this year. So those factors kind of play into that on the pricing in Asia.","So I'd say still an inflation story, kind of what you see on pricing around the world. And then we'll just \u2013 we'll have to find out where the CPIs of the world go here.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Your line is now open.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes, hi. Good morning.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Hey, P.J.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Matt, you mentioned that your packaged gas business has stabilized, maybe the gas part of it. How do you see that playing out in margins? And I know you don't break out packaged gas margins every quarter, but roughly ballpark, what are margins today? And where do you think they can go if the business improves?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Well, yeah. I think just to state a couple things that I think you already know. But number one, packaged is, as a distribution business, has very good variable margins, but you've got a lot of SG&A and period costs, fixed costs that you need to distribute that product and touch it and get it around to its customers. So as any packaged volume recovers, it tends to be nicely accretive on a variable margin basis. And we obviously saw the reverse effect of that in the decline. So any recovery tends to be fairly good.","Gas is better. Since hardgoods we don't have producer economics, we're just a distributor, we don't get the type economics that we would in gas, given that we go deeper in the supply chain. So it is something that can be nicely accretive. It's something that on the rebound you can see kind of immediate effects on the business and effects to the overall organization.","So hopefully even stabilizing, we can stem the kind of decline, I'll call it, in the margin. And each incremental cylinder sold or hardgood sold should help.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And then secondly, on your backlog. Your backlog is at $1.5 billion with 80% of that in North America. So are you gaining more than your fair share in North America?","And then I noticed that you don't have any projects in India where you always had a strong position. And your competitors this morning mentioned that they are gaining share in India. Was wondering if you can talk about that dynamic? Thank you.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Okay. I'll start with India. We're growing in India, kind of mid-single, high single digit, growing as planned. There are a few projects out there that we're looking at and working on that I'll call \u2013 are in our pre-backlog. But I don't have any concerns on \u2013 if you would view it as share shift or anything in that regard in India. I think India has been a very focused area for us. It's part that we have a strong position, and we expect to continue that.","As far as the Gulf, I mean these are projects that we've been working on in some cases for years. We have a strong infrastructure of both process and atmospheric gases. We've got a great team down there. And these are very, very long sales cycles. You're working with the customer in some cases two years, possibly three years on potential projects. And you've just got to be very smart around how you allocate your time and which projects you focus your efforts towards.","And like I said we have a good team down there. They know what they're doing. And I think they've really focused on the right projects with the best chance of success. And we've been winning them. And we expect that we're going to win more. So we've been quite happy with that and more to come.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thank you. Wanted to ask about the relative size of these two cost buckets, one being natural gas for syngas and hydrogen (36:50) and the other one being electrical power for ASUs. What's the relative size of those two cost buckets? And is it fair to assume you pass-through the former and not the latter?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Well, yeah, Steve. I mean for the most part we pass through both, right? But as you could imagine, natural gas is more volatile on its pricing, number one, than say electrical power. Because electrical power, you tend to get long term contracts. There's a blend of how they're basically generated, could be nuclear, could be coal, could be natural gas. So the mill rates are more stable than natural gas.","And also our HyCO business, a much larger percentage of the revenues are actually the pass-through of energy. When you get into the ASUs, while electrical power is a component, it's not as significant as what you'd find in the HyCO business.","So long story short, when you see our pass-through impact, the vast majority of it tends to be natural gas for the HyCO business. And as our HyCO business continues to grow, that number will become more relevant.","Now obviously dependent upon the type of contract you structure, if you do a tolling arrangement, it may not be as significant, where you'd never take ownership of the molecules versus say a full energy pass-through style. So depends on the contract style. But clearly more of that is nat gas for HyCO than I'd call it mill rates for the ASU side.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And you are able to pass through some of that electrical power contractually in your liquid business?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Yes. So liquid business, there's a couple different mechanisms. Sometimes it's strictly just straight contractual pass-through. Sometimes there are surcharging mechanisms. Or there are other various ways that those costs can be accounted for in your merchant.","But as you can imagine with every successive supply mode, the lags extend. So in an onsite it's pretty much an immediate pass-through. With merchant you could have a few months' lag. And with packaged you could have even more than a few months' lag. So it's just a matter of how far it reaches through that supply chain in terms of the timing that you actually recover it.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just real quickly any trends in the month of April that are different from what you saw in the March quarter, that might lead you to be a little more cautious than what your results suggested?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Not at this stage, no.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thank you.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Welcome.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Your line is now open.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Good morning.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","You mentioned that you're not going to be buying back stock here. How much share creep would we normally expect to see in a year for Praxair?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Well, I...","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","And when do you plan on adopting the new accounting standards around option expensing?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Okay. So on the \u2013 we'll start with share creep. I think the good news is, while we are not in the market, and kind of barred from the market, the ability to exercise options is also a bit limited, as you can imagine. So the amount of dilution that's being created is also reduced, given the situation.","So I think, from that perspective, while we can't buy back, I don't expect as much dilution as in the past. There would probably be a little. But even if you look at this quarter, the share creep wasn't that significant, because the activity wasn't that significant to cause a dilution. So we'll have to see. I can't gauge a number, because it just depends upon when windows open or close. But hopefully, if a window opens, it'll open a buyback as well.","As far as the accounting standard, we already adopted \u2013 if you're referring to the one about how the treatment of taxes for share-based comp \u2013 that, we already pre-adopted. We had announced that, and that was in our quarterly results about two quarters, three quarters ago. So, assuming that that's the one you're talking about, that's already been adopted. That actually caused our tax rate to be a little bit better here on a P&L basis, since those credits were re-classed, per the accounting requirement.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. And just to put some additional numbers maybe around the manufacturing recovery that you're starting to see. On slide 15, you show the 6% sequential increase in manufacturing. What would be the normal seasonal increase? Like, how much of that 6% would be normal seasonality? Versus how much might be some recovery on top of that?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Well, both our U.S. packaged and our South American business normally see seasonal improvements. As I mentioned before, the extended holiday outages tend to make that happen. March usually is a stronger month in general for packaged anyways, especially given day count. And there was no Easter in this first quarter. It got pushed to second quarter.","So, look, it's more of an art than a science. But I'd say it's probably a little bit less than that 6%. I mean we clearly saw some recovery in the U.S. packaged on a sequential basis. So that's helping to make that number a bit higher. So maybe there's a couple percent there that are above and beyond what I'll call normal seasonal. But that's just more of a guess than something that we've got hard numbers for.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","No, that's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Matt, I was hoping you might size the decline in the oil and gas activity, either a sales or earnings basis, so we can sort of scope what the recovery might be out into the future?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Sure. So I think Bob, at one point, if you want to call it the peak, maybe it wasn't the peak. But our upstream energy business was probably as much as 5-plus percent, almost 6% of global sales. It tends to be higher margin business. You have a lot of merchant business there. You get better a packaged business to serve the oil patch. I'd say \u2013 and that's direct. That's more direct oil well service.","Clearly there's an indirect portion that's in the manufacturing side of things. And this does not really include that. So that number has pretty much plummeted to maybe 2% or less. And all that we have left is really what I'd characterize as sort of enhanced oil recovery, the onsite ones, where you'll have, say, a large nitrogen plant in a massive field and you get paid a fixed fee.","The merchant piece is pretty much down. Mexico is down 80-plus percent; U.S., probably similar numbers, at least 70-plus percent; Canada is probably down by now 50%, and will drop again here this quarter. So, pretty dramatic decline.","As far as a recovery for us, we would need two things to happen. Number one, we need completions. So these things called DUCs, the drilled but uncompleted wells, we need them to go back and complete them. The drilling itself is not a big thing for us. It'll help our packaged business, but it doesn't help our oil well service business. So the completions is number one.","And then number two, when they do the completions, we need enhanced type of fluids. So these would be more foam fracs that have nitrogen in them, as opposed to 100% \u2013 what's called slickwater, which is just all water.","So those are the two conditions. What you tend to find is, when oil price stays low, people go a little more hydrofracking. And then when the prices start rising, they'll start to switch more to these foam fracs. So we'll have to see. But a pretty significant impact, I'd say, as far as \u2013 at least almost 4% decline in our global sales.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks very much.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Welcome.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global. Your line is now open.","Michael J. Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Hey, Mike.","Michael J. Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Matt, I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about the U.S. Gulf Coast bidding activity strength. Talk maybe about where Praxair's advantages and disadvantages are as you look to get a strong return on winning bids. Are those advantages determined more by location or more by specific application and your engineering know-how?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Well, I mean it's kind of all of the above. I mean obviously every major firm that's competing, whether it's a sale of plant or a sale of gas (45:44), they have capabilities. They have know-how. I think though, what we're able to bring is a combination of all of them, right? We can bring relationships, we bring engineering, we bring know-how, and we bring an infrastructure. And a pretty good infrastructure of both hydrogen, CO, nitrogen, oxygen.","And the combination of those, plus our cavern asset, gives us really a strong proposition for not just a very good cost effective solution, but a very reliable solution. I mean you got to understand that when a potential customer wants to put anything from $0.5 billion to $3 billion into the ground, they need to make sure that what they call the utility island does not preclude them from running their assets, right? And whether that's electrical systems, boiler feed water, hydrogen, or oxygen, it's got to make it into their system so their assets run. And so that's a very, very important part of the sell process.","And in addition our team has a lot of creative solutions, ideas on how to really leverage our asset base to give them the most cost effective solution.","So \u2013 and as you can imagine, Mike, it's a lot of \u2013 especially on the processed gases, there are a lot of co-products, right? If you make hydrogen \u2013 or if you make CO, you're going to make hydrogen. Clearly with oxygen comes nitrogen. So being able to leverage all those molecules with the right network also helps bring good solutions.","So like I said, our team does a very good job of that. And we've announced some nice wins here. And we feel pretty good about the future as well.","Michael J. Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","And then I had a couple questions on Europe. Just still kind of trying to wrap my head around a 6% volume growth out of Europe. How much of that was from new projects contributing? How much was from Russia? And are you seeing any impact related to some of the higher power costs that one of your competitors was referring to?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Well, I'd say on projects, maybe it's a couple percent of that number, mostly Port of Antwerp. We're lapping some of the larger Russian ones, so the impact from Russia is smaller.","But like I said, when you look at especially our Southern Europe, it's a lot of packaged, a lot of merchant. So you have some more resilient markets. And we're just seeing better consumption in those gases for those particular markets. I mean it could be things like aquaculture in the food side, obviously beverage side. We just are seeing good progress there.","We also are aligned with, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, some of the highest, most competitive, most cost competitive customers. So the particular mills that we supply or the particular other chemical assets we supply are world-class in many, many cases and Europe included. And they run well and they run hard.","So that's what we're seeing. And I think the volumes have been -- they've been good. I mean I agree with you. I mean 6% Europe is not something we would have thought of even a year ago. But the team's running quite well there.","Michael J. Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Welcome.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of James Sheehan with SunTrust. Your line is now open.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. Could you give us some more color on your merchant utilization rates in the major regions?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Yeah, sure, James. So U.S. we're kind of running probably low 80s% right now. We've seen some improvements there as more and more merchant sales have been going on, so I think that's good. Still have obviously capacity. But those have been picking up here. Brazil, while we're probably running low 70s%, and that's mostly LIN & LOX going into the more resilient markets. Argon is below 50%. Argon utilizations are quite poor in Brazil, given what's going on.","Europe is trending up mid to high 70s%, given the volumes that we're seeing there. And then Asia, it's just a mix, dependent upon whether you're China, India, or Korea. But all in you're probably high 70s%, could be getting close to 80% there.","So I think the bottom line is we have capacity. But in the same token, we're seeing the right direction. And it's in line with kind of the trends we're seeing of merchant in those geographies.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. And how are you thinking about strategic options for PST down the line, perhaps after the Linde merger or even currently?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Well, look, PST is an important segment for us. It's running well. We have some very strong footprints in attractive markets with the leading customers. So we're going to continue to support it. And we're going to continue to give it everything it needs to be successful.","As far as any strategic decision in any form, that's just something that will be evaluated in time. And that could be any business. But at this point we're very happy with our PST business. And we're going to continue to give it the resources it needs to succeed.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Juan Pelaez - Praxair, Inc.","I think we have time for...","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Sure, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna. Your line is now open.","Emily Wagner - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good morning. This is Emily Wagner on for Don. I guess just adding on to the prior question on utilization. What is needed to get industry operating rates above 80%? I mean we've been in an industrial recovery since 2009. But operating rates have been in the similar range during that time. So what macros really need to pick up to see that rise?","Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.","Sure, Emily. So clearly the numbers we're giving relate to liquid capability for utilization, so the ability to make liquid. So that ignores whether you could be molecule constrained or distribution constrained. It's just the liquefiers.","From that perspective there are pockets in the world where we're running almost 100%. 100% is almost -- it's very, very difficult to maintain that. So clearly at full capacity you're kind of running more like 90%, 95%. But there are also parts in the world we're running lower.","So I would just say that merchant will drive that. People have made less and less onsite plants with merchant credits, given the environment we've been over the last few years. So I think capacity addition has been declining here just given the environment, given the lack of onsite opportunities, and given the current merchant pricing and utilizations over the last few years.","So it should be a slow ramp. But it's a ramp where you just need more merchant liquid demand. And we'll see. But even in the heyday, kind of pre-2008, we were probably running maybe mid to high 80s% in the U.S. We never really got much higher than that. And that felt very, very stretched for our logistics team.","So to achieve 90%-plus on a consolidated basis is quite difficult frankly. Because you always have plants that are down or turn around. Or you might be converting merchant to a small onsite. So there are other ways to keep plants from being too utilized.","Emily Wagner - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you.","Matthew J.

A reconciliation of these numbers to our GAAP reported numbers for 2011 and 2010 appears in the appendix to this presentation and the press release.","Jim will start the call with a brief overview of our results and outlook, then I'll review the slides for the full year and quarter results and then turn it back over to Jim for the guidance and business outlook. We will then be available to answer questions.","James S. Sawyer","Thank you, Kelcey, and good morning, everyone. Praxair finished 2011 delivering record results with full year sales growth of 11%, operating profit growth of 14% and EPS growth of 15%, turning right along the midpoint of our long-term growth objectives. We continued to deliver solid execution and productivity, which fueled operating profit growth in excess of top line growth, and industry-leading return on capital and return on equity which allowed us to grow EPS even faster.","For the fourth quarter, sales grew 7%; operating profit, 10%; and EPS, 9%. If you adjust out the change in foreign currency rates, which largely occurred in September, the fourth quarter would have been right on trend with the full year. We're continuing to see strong organic growth in most of our markets, with the exception of Europe and the global electronics end market. We did see slowing growth in Brazil in both the third and fourth quarters but are optimistic that growth will pick up in Brazil in the second half of 2012. More importantly, the U.S. economy, and particularly the manufacturing sector, finished the year on a strong note and we expect this to continue well into 2012.","We\u2019re issuing earnings guidance of $5.70 to $5.90 for 2012, representing 5% to 9% year-over-year growth. While this is slightly below some of the analysts' estimates, we don't believe the impact of currencies had been fully factored in. At current exchange rates, our year-over-year comps face a 5% headwind or about $0.25 of EPS. The biggest exchange rate impacts are in Mexico, India, Brazil and Europe.","I'm not always a good forecaster of currencies, but hopefully, we could have some upside in Mexico and India. However, this could be easily offset by further downside in Europe and Canada. Who knows? We do try to be nimble in adjusting our business operations to changes in macroeconomic conditions. Consequently, we've undertaken modest restructuring of our European industrial gas business, consolidating plants and reducing headcount by about 5%.","Similarly, we're restructuring our European Surface Technology operations, closing a facility in Switzerland which is no longer competitive at current exchange rates and consolidating other operations. We're also making modest headcount reductions in South America and in our electronics business.","At the end of 2011, we largely completed the $1.5 billion share repurchase program which was announced in July of 2010. Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program of $1.5 billion, which depending on market conditions, we anticipate completing in 2013.","As we expect to be able to continue our strong cash flow generation and growth in our operating profit, our plan is to repurchase enough shares to reduce the share count by about 2% annually without diminishing our credit ratios, our solid long-term debt rating of A and our low-cost funding capability.","Additionally, the board approved a 10% increase in the dividend to a $2.20 annualized payout. This is consistent with our past practice of double-digit annual dividend increases and our desire to keep the dividend yield comparable to the S&P 500 average while simultaneously repurchasing shares and continuing to grow our capital investment program.","Last year, we spent $1.8 billion in capital, the majority of which went to new on-site projects where we have signed take-or-pay contracts with customers. For 2012, we expect to increase CapEx to $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion. Our signed backlog of new on-site projects increased from $2.2 billion to a record $2.7 billion during 2012.","New project activity remains robust. We're in the part of the economic cycle recovery where our customers\u2019 capacity utilization is increasing and they are planning on new projects and expansions particularly in the emerging markets.","As the gestation period of our projects is 2 to 3 years from proposal to start-up, we expect the revenue and earnings contribution from new project start-ups to significantly increase in 2013 versus 2011 and 2012.","Now I'll turn the call back over to Kelcey, who will review in more detail our 2011 results.","Kelcey E. Hoyt","Thanks, Jim.","Please turn to Slide 3 for an overview of 2011 full year results. As Jim commented earlier, our results in 2011 were very strong. Overall sales were $11.3 billion, 11% above 2010 primarily due to 8% organic growth from volume and price, including new plant start-ups in every geographic segment. Energy, metals, manufacturing and chemical end markets showed the strongest growth from the prior year.","Foreign currency translation increased sales by 3% for the year primarily due to the weakness of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real, euro, Mexican peso and Canadian dollar during the first 8 months of 2011.","Operating profit was $2.5 billion, 14% above 2010 primarily due to volume growth, productivity and price. In 2011, we achieved $375 million in cost savings from productivity. Operating margin improved 50 basis points to a record 21.9%.","Full year net income of $1.7 billion grew 13%, lower than the growth in operating profit due primarily to higher interest expense related to 2 long-term debt issuances during the year.","During 2011, we issued $1 billion of debt with 10-year maturities at interest rates of 3% and 4.05%. We did this to take advantage of low long-term rates in our tight issue spreads to treasury. The proceeds were used to reduce commercial paper, such at year end, 85% of our debt portfolio was fixed rate and only 15% was floating rate. Thus, we have significantly reduced our exposure to rising interest rates.","Earnings per share of $5.43 grew 15% versus the prior year on a 2% lower share count as a result of our ongoing share repurchase program. Our after-tax return on capital for the year was 14.7% and return on equity was 28.2%.","Please turn to Slide 4. We generated operating cash flow of $2.5 billion for the year, which was a record. Capital spending for the year was $1.8 billion, about $400 million or 30% above 2010. This increase is driven by the strong growth in the backlog during 2011. About 75% of our annual capital spending goes into new growth projects under long-term contracts with customers, about 20% to maintenance spend and the remaining 5% in cost-reduction projects with a payback period typically of about 3 years.","We spent $294 million on acquisitions primarily related to packaged gas distributors in the United States, a joint venture in the Middle East and increased ownership of our business in Scandinavia.","In 2011, we purchased $742 million of stock, net of issuances, and paid dividends of $602 million.","Please turn to Slide 5 for our results in the fourth quarter. Overall, our results in the quarter reflected continued strength across North America and strong growth in Asia. Growth in Brazil was positive but slower. In Europe, underlying results were below prior year. Moreover, the U.S. dollar strengthened against foreign currencies in September due to macro concerns and the 4% tailwind that we had enjoyed in the first 3 quarters became a 1% year-over-year headwind in the fourth quarter.","Fourth quarter sales were $2.8 billion, 7% above the prior year primarily due to volume and price. Metals, energy, chemicals and manufacturing had the strongest growth versus the prior-year quarter. New plant start-ups in North America, South America and Asia contributed to the overall growth.","Sequentially, sales declined 3% primarily due to the impacts of negative currency translation. Overall volumes decreased 1% sequentially due primarily to declines in Europe.","Operating profit of $619 million grew 10% from the prior-year quarter due to volume, price, cost reduction and productivity savings. Operating margin rose to 22.1%.","Net income was $414 million, 7% above the prior-year quarter, and earnings per share grew 9% to $1.36. Net income increased less than operating profit due to higher interest expense, while EPS grew faster due to the lower share count. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 28%.","Operating cash flow of $791 million and a modest increase in debt funded $572 million of capital expenditures, $149 million of dividends and the repurchase of $148 million of stock, net of issuances. Our after-tax return on capital for the quarter was 14.5%.","Now I'll review our results in North America, which are summarized on Page 6. Sales in North America were $1.4 billion, 7% above the prior year. Excluding foreign currency and the U.S. Homecare divestiture, underlying sales growth was 10%. Sequentially, organic sales grew 2%, but currency and cost pass-through reduced sales by 4% due to the weakening of the Mexican peso, lower natural gas prices and power pass-through.","Merchant volumes in North America increased 6% versus prior year. Merchant volumes grew in the United States due to stronger sales of liquid nitrogen, oxygen, argon, hydrogen and helium primarily to the metals, chemicals and manufacturing markets. Canada and Mexico merchant volumes grew primarily from liquid nitrogen sales to the energy market. Packaged gas sales continue to exhibit a strong recovery in line with U.S. manufacturing. Same-store sales growth was 14% year-over-year.","During 2011, PDI acquired several distributors, following our very focused strategy in the specialty gases sector, regions where we see strong economic growth and properties where we can increase the quality of the acquisition through synergy with our existing packaged and merchant gases.","Operating profit of $364 million grew 17% from the prior year quarter due primarily to price, productivity and seasonal reliability bonuses. Operating margin rose to 26%, an all-time high for North America, as our businesses were running on all cylinders: on-site, merchant and packaged in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Our 4% year-over-year price improvement and the divestiture of the U.S. Homecare business were significant drivers of margin improvement. In addition, the 2 world-scale steam-methane reformers at Whiting, Indiana, contributed high margins because the customer contracts do not include revenue from the sale of natural gas. Sequentially, lower natural gas prices reduced sales but not operating profit, which is reflected in the higher operating margin.","Our outlook for the North America business is quite positive. Current business transfer energy remain robust. Refinery hydrogen volumes remained steady, typically impacted only by turnarounds which will occur in the first half of the year as part of the normal seasonal pattern. From a project perspective, we are tracking as expected with our hydrogen pipeline under construction in Louisiana and the 2 SMRs under construction to serve Valero's new hydrocrackers in Port Arthur, Texas, and St. Charles, Louisiana.","Frac-ing in Canada remained strong due to robust activity to recover high-value natural gas liquids. During the quarter, we supplied high volumes of liquid nitrogen to the region, and we don't see that slowing until the seasonal spring thaws impact the ability for the trucks to access the sites during the second quarter of 2012. Oil well service volumes in Mexico to supply liquids and services to PEMEX have been strong and are expected to remain so with the high price of oil.","We are very upbeat about the outlook for manufacturing in the United States, going forward. U.S. manufacturers are now globally more competitive with high productivity, low material cost and a favorable international trade picture.","Chemical sales in 2011 were strong with a resurgence in the competitiveness of U.S. producers, advantaged by low natural gas prices. This is not expected to reverse in the near term, and we remain well positioned to continue to supply the industry.","While steel producers in the United States took their typical fourth quarter seasonal shutdowns and the opportunity and lower pricing to do maintenance, January volumes have been positive and we expect our steel customers and volumes to remain robust for 2012.","Please turn to Page 7 for our results in Europe. Sales in Europe were $380 million, 12% above $339 million in the prior year quarter. This was due to increasing our ownership from 50% up to 66% of our Yara Praxair joint venture in Scandinavia, which now calls for us to consolidate the sales of the company. Excluding this consolidation, sales declined due to lower volumes.","Overall volumes declined 4% year-over-year and were 3% below the third quarter primarily due to lower packaged gases in Spain and Italy. The continued economic uncertainty is a deterrent to any potential infrastructure investment or construction activity that would boost packaged gas sales. Volume trends in Germany, Benelux and Scandinavia are stable, although we did see temporary on-site sales decline to steel and chemical customers during the quarter for inventory destocking and maintenance.","Operating profit was $61 million, as compared to $68 million in the prior year quarter, and was negatively impacted by the lower volumes, primarily in Spain and Italy. During the fourth quarter, we took actions to reduce headcount and consolidate facilities which are running at low capacity utilization. And during January of this year in Europe, we announced a price increase for merchant and packaged gases, which we hope will help to stem the margin decline in Europe.","Page 8 shows our results in South America. South American segment sales were $532 million compared to $516 million in the prior year quarter. Excluding currency depreciation, sales were 8% above the prior year primarily due to 5% higher price and 1% higher volumes. Sequentially, sales declined 12% due to 8% currency and 4% lower volumes.","During the quarter, some of our customers curtailed production for longer than the typical seasonal holiday shutdowns, as well as some acceleration of maintenance from the first quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2011 during this period of slower economic activity primarily in the steel and manufacturing markets. However, food and beverage grew due to seasonality as well as new customer signings.","Operating profit in South America grew to $118 million versus $114 million a year ago. The operating margin was maintained through strong productivity and price actions. About $350 million of the current project backlog relates to projects for South America that will start up during 2012 and 2013. In addition, the pipeline of new business proposals remained strong in the areas of energy, manufacturing, steel and chemicals.","Slide 9 shows our results in Asia. Asia had a good quarter. Sales of $325 million were 6% above 2011 due to volume and price. Our base business volumes were assisted by large plant start-ups in India and China. Electronics volumes were flat year-over-year.","Sequential volume growth slowed, in line with local industrial production. Sequential volumes in China for the manufacturing and chemicals sector remained positive, but overall volumes declined 2% primarily due to electronics as we experienced reduced demand from solar-producing customers.","Volumes in India and Korea continued to grow, but we experienced lower volumes in Thailand due to production disruptions from the floods. In Thailand, demand is picking up again in met fab and electronics as our customers' production comes back on-stream and we are seeing some slightly higher volumes from the pent-up demand.","We continue to grow the business by bringing our applications technology that enhance productivity, improve quality, reduce cost and implement environmentally friendly options into the market.","During the quarter, Praxair India set up a new state-of-the-art research and technology center in Bangalore. The facility provides a full range of research and development capabilities for various customer industries such as metal fabrication, pharmaceutical, steel and water treatment. Our growing team of engineers and scientists have expertise in understanding and meeting the requirements of our customers' processes and is a key part of our global technology organization.","In India, merchant volumes increased 12% year-over-year, and sequentially, 11%. Approximately 1\/2 of our merchant volume growth in the region is won through application technology. We've increased high-value argon sales through converting customers from CO2 welding to the use of argon-based inert gases, which provides better quality and improved productivity for the customer. Pharma applications and the related sales of liquid nitrogen for reactor cooling contributed to the growth in sync with ramped-up generic drug volumes for export. Our met fab experience allows us to differentiate ourselves and grow volumes to bring value to the customers.","Asia's operating profit increased $52 million -- to $52 million from $50 million due to volume and price.","Our outlook for Asia is quite positive. The region has more opportunities for greenfield industrial gas opportunities than any other in the world, and our project backlog reflects that we are winning our share of opportunities in the region. We are well positioned in China, India, Korea and Thailand and remain focused on growing the business at the right returns. We'll continue to do that through our focus on production and distribution density.","Our results for Surface Technologies are shown on Page 10. PST sales this quarter were $160 million compared to $150 million in 2011, which represents organic growth of 7%. Sales growth came from the energy market, from higher coatings of parts used in oil and gas exploration and from higher volumes of aviation coatings.","Operating profit for the quarter was $24 million, 20% above last year. During the quarter, we took action in the Surface Technologies business to reduce cost in the weaker-performing industrial businesses in Europe primarily through headcount reduction and site consolidation.","The outlook for this business remains positive, as well. The Surface Technologies business serves 3 primary markets: industrial for coatings on machinery such as textiles and printing; aerospace for jet engine parts; and energy, which includes industrial gas turbines as well as parts used in oil and gas exploration.","Now I'll turn this call back to Jim to discuss our guidance for 2012.","James S. Sawyer","Thanks, Kelcey.","Please turn to Slide 11. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, our initial EPS guidance for 2012 is $5.70 to $5.90, and for the first quarter, it is $1.33 to $1.38. At current exchange rates, this guidance factors in headwind of about $0.25 for the full year due to currency changes and about $0.07 for the first quarter on a year-over-year basis. Interest and pension expense combined will add about a $0.10 headwind year-over-year. Interest expense will increase about $20 million due to increased borrowings and pension expense will increase about $30 million primarily driven by lower discount rates.","On a sequential basis, the first quarter exchange rates are about 1% lower than the just-ended fourth quarter. From a seasonality perspective, the first quarter tends to be our weakest quarter. In North America, construction activity tends to be lower due to the weather, as is beverage carbonation, and we also have a higher level of refinery turnarounds in the Gulf Coast. South America is generally weaker as a result of summer holidays and Carnival, while in Asia, the Lunar New Year eclipses about a week of sales revenue.","On an underlying basis, we're continuing to see good sequential growth in most of our markets. During the fourth quarter, we were really operating on all 4 cylinders in North America, and we expect manufacturing and energy demand to keep growing.","In Europe, there's lots of room for improvement, but we will not be counting on a rising tide to float our ship. Our cost-reduction activities should begin to take effect in the second half of the year in the gases business and in PST. Additionally, we'll be working hard on getting price improvement to offset inflation. So far, we have not been able to accomplish this in Europe, but it is essential in order for us to improve our margins.","So in South America, inflation is creeping up to the high-single digits, and likewise, we will have to compensate with higher prices. We do expect the slowdown in growth in 2011 to be brief as it was punctuated with a number of temporary customer production curtailments. The government has initiated a number of stimulus actions and leading indicators suggest that they are taking effect.","Our outlook for China continues to be robust even though economic growth appears to be slowing. Fortunately, most of our new projects are in sectors like energy and coal gasification which we believe are more strategic to the country and less sensitive to retail conditions.","And now I'd like to turn the conference call over to question-and-answer.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Jim, just on the backlog. It was flat versus both Q3 and Q2 at $2.7 billion. Would you expect by year end of 2012 that the backlog is flat, up or down from current levels?","James S. Sawyer","I'm expecting that it will be up from current levels. We've got a lot of project start-ups in the fourth quarter of 2012, but more going on in 2013. So most of the project start-ups in the backlog aren't going to be taking place until into 2013 and that kind of accounts for what's coming out of the backlog. As far as what's going to be going into the backlog, we've got over $1 billion of projects that we're in tight negotiation in right now and expect to be announcing over the next couple of months. So while, I think, $2.7 billion backlog is a good kind of long-term equilibrium for us and is enough to sustain our sales growth, as we're projecting, I do think it'll be higher at the end of 2012.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And Jim, what will the backlog add to both sales and EPS in 2012?","James S. Sawyer","All right, so in 2012, we're looking for about a $0.30 contribution to EPS. In 2013, we think it'll be double that.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just last thing, on merchant pricing in Europe, can you provide a little more color on the most recent price increase?","James S. Sawyer","Right. Well, we're holding the flag and trying to raise prices across the board. Just basically, we got power cost increases going on there as well as sort of mandated labor cost increases. And as we've talked about over many times over the years, in order to get margin up, you got to get either productivity above inflation or a combination of productivity and price increase above inflation, and we just haven't been successful in getting that done. So we're going out on our own and raising prices directly to customers and we hope we'll get some traction in that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar of Citibank.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In electronics, you saw some weakness and it seems that you're expecting more of a longer downturn in electronics, given your headcount reduction in that segment. And that outlook seems a bit different from several other companies that have reported so far, so can you discuss why you\u2019re sort of more negative in electronics and recovery there?","James S. Sawyer","Yes. Well, first of all, I would say that I'm never the best person in the room to forecast what's going on in electronic demand. But basically, you've got semiconductor demand, and then on top of that, you've got flat-panel screens and solar panel activity, both of which are smaller than the semiconductor in terms of volumes. But the solar panel situation is not good, as most governments that have been subsidizing solar power are no longer subsidizing solar power. And flat panel demand has slowed down, as well. We've taken some cost reduction in our business in electronics but not a significant amount. We basically kind of restructured our management team, but we're not closing any facilities there.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, this may be the first time in many years that U.S. is strong and emerging markets are looking a bit weaker for you. Can you compare your margin operating rates in different regions, currently?","James S. Sawyer","Right. Let me just start with Mexico and South America. The principal problem in Mexico, which I think people didn't really foresee coming, is that the peso is at about 14 to $1 now and it was about 12 to $1 3, 4 months ago, and that's the biggest part of our call-down, if you want to call it that, in our earnings guidance. But underlying, we're seeing strong activity in Mexico, record volumes, good price increases and a strengthening demand from PEMEX which is our single largest customer. In Brazil, you had the economy really start to slow down in the third and fourth quarter. Part of that was the function of the currency getting too strong during the beginning part of the year. And part of that was due to some bottlenecks in production and shipping and so forth. And then, you get into the summer season in Brazil, and what we saw in the fourth quarter was a lot of our customers taking temporary shutdowns to reduce inventory, remembering that, that's both the summer and the holiday period for them, but that is largely temporary in nature and we expect those plants to be starting up again and moving forward into 2012. So we're continuing to be very optimistic on South America. India, underlying demand continues to be strong. But the Indian rupee's moved up to 52 now, so that's hurting our translation, but we don't see any weakness there. And in China, we really haven't seen weakness in our end markets. We've had difficulty getting price increases the way we would like to get price increases. Labor costs are up significantly in China, as are power costs, and so we need to get more price improvement in China. But the outlook for new business development and the proposals that we're working on continues to grow as it moves away from the steel and chemical sectors and moves into the coal gasification and power areas. So we're -- we've got more projects in China we're working on now than ever before. And the questions are really deciding which ones are practical to work on and which ones are not practical to work on. Thailand, we had a big impact in the fourth quarter from the floods. Our biggest plant in Thailand was underwater for the entire fourth quarter, as a lot of our customers' plants, and that'll take another 6 months to straighten out there. And then Korea, our biggest customer, Samsung, and so we saw some slowdown in the semiconductor sector there with Samsung, but we've got $300 million of projects starting up with Samsung about a year from now, and expect that long-term growth to go quite favorably. So if I really sum it up, we haven't seen a lot of, over the -- across-the-board weakness in emerging markets. We've got some specific issues in some specific locations. Now moving over to Europe: Europe has really been weak for us in the fourth quarter. Usually, the third quarter is the weakest quarter in Europe because it's the summer holiday quarter. I've never in my life seen the fourth quarter be weaker than the third quarter, but here it was this year, so we'll just have to wait it out and see in Europe. But I'll just come back to North America because we're very bullish on North America where volumes continue to grow, customer orders continue to pick up, the packaged gas business is strong and getting stronger every month. So I think we're most optimistic right now about North America.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Jim, last year, you used to talk about hydrogen opportunities in Brazil. Can you give us an update on how that's going?","James S. Sawyer","Yes. Well, we're still working on hydrogen opportunities in Brazil, and of course, they would be with Petrobras. We've been working with Petrobras on an exclusive basis, developing hydrogen proposals and negotiating plans with them, but they've had a lot of delays in a number of areas themselves and have not yet had to make a commitment on whether to insource or outsource the hydrogen needs at the comparative [ph] refinery and several other refineries, but we're anticipating that decision to come soon.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, there was, obviously, there was a large step-down in volume growth in your South American and Asian businesses relative to the previous 3 quarters. And so I was wondering, do you think that South America and Asia on a volume basis will grow faster in 2012 than 2011, or slower, or at the same rate.","James S. Sawyer","I would say that, in both areas, the fourth quarter was a bit of an anomaly in the sense that we had the plant outages in Thailand which offset other growth in Asia, and similarly, we had production curtailments in Brazil which offset other growth. Absent those 2 things, I'd see the underlying growth, like what we saw in the first 3 quarters of 2011, to repeat itself in 2012.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Jim, you talked a bit about pricing, and in Europe, you said you're going on your own. So my question is, just what's the, what are competitors doing? And I know you didn't really comment on sort of what operating rates are in different markets, so maybe talk a bit about Europe. But also, in the U.S., I noticed you had a very aggressive price increase on Jan 1 of up to 15% and sort of across the board, and I know that takes time to get through, but if you could just talk about your outlook for pricing and then the competitive environment for getting price increases in the different geographic markets.","James S. Sawyer","Right. Well, let me start with North America and recognize, of course, that in our on-site contracts, the pricing is basically set from the beginning of the contract other than the fact that it'll escalate by formula with power cost and inflation. So the shorter-term opportunities for price increases are in the merchant and packaged gas. And in the merchant business, the average contract length is about 5 years. So when we talk about a 15% price increase, generally speaking, that'll only apply to customers whose contracts are up for a change in price, okay? And I think that's a fairly -- that's a rate of increase, which divided over a couple of years, is 3% to 4%. That's kind of what our long-term experience has been, not necessarily in recessionary times but in good times. And I think we'll probably get that. In packaged gases, costs are rising pretty much across the board. The cost of gases are going up, the cost of transportation is going up, labor cost is going up. As well as in hardgoods business, the cost of materials is going up. And so we need to get more price increases in packaged gases just to offset our cost inflation and I think we'll be quite successful in getting that. In Europe, it's really a mixed bag. The capacity utilization in Spain and Italy is very low and I think that probably applies industry-wide, whereas in Scandinavia and in Germany, it is a lot tighter. And it's -- the thing about getting a price increase is that, the hardest part, as we say, about increasing prices is convincing your own people to go out and do it. And that's what we're all about right now.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","But Jim, when you mentioned you're doing it on your own in Europe, does that mean that the bigger European-based players are not going after price and that they are more concerned with just keeping their price low?","James S. Sawyer","I can't really, I can't speak for them, but we haven't seen it, though.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Then just quickly, on packaged gases, of that 14% same-store sales, what's sort of the split between hardgoods recovery and gases and rental?","James S. Sawyer","Right. That's continuing with hardgoods leading gases, about 22% growth in hardgoods and 10% in gases. And that should continue to be a leading indicator of more growth because, generally speaking, if we kind of simplify this into a typical job shop with your customer, when they reach capacity utilization, they need to order more equipment to do the job that they've got orders for. And that's really what pushes the hardgoods orders up as fast as they're going up so I think that's a good leading indicator.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison of First Analysis.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Wanted to ask a couple of questions around steel and in argon markets. You noted some steel weakness in a couple of different geographies. You also mentioned the work that you're doing and seeing nice growth in argon use for welding in Asia. So I was hoping that maybe you could just talk in a little bit more detail about what you're seeing in terms of argon supply and demand across the different geographies.","James S. Sawyer","Okay. Well, I think most people understand that argon is generally a byproduct of oxygen and what we're taking in our larger oxygen plants. Some of the argon is used specifically in the steel industry and particularly in specialty steels like stainless steels and so forth, but it's also used in the packaged gas business in high-quality welding. So right now, in North America, we've been seeing a pretty good steel picture, we've been actually improving as the year ended, and a pretty good, pretty equilibrium balance for argon supply and demand. Over in China, there has been a little bit of excess argon supply on the market brought on by some large plant start-ups by competitors and that needs to get soaked up in the market in order to keep the price of argon up, it's actually down sequentially in China. But the other thing that we work on, and I think we're being very successful in both China and India, is doing what we call application technology and teaching people how to weld with shielding gases like argon where they can get a higher-quality weld and more productivity in the welding. And so that's kind of a long-term opportunity to significantly increase demand for argon, but it comes in lots and lots and lots of small sales efforts.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And what about in South America?","James S. Sawyer","South America is fine. I mean, we had some steel companies down at year end for some inventory reduction, but we see that coming back during 2012. And the argon market is very stable there.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And historically, you guys have had some currency hedges that, from time to time, have swung earnings one way or another. Did you have any of those hedges in place during Q4, and do you have any in place now?","James S. Sawyer","Oh, no, we -- it's hard to hedge currencies across the quarter and so -- because you have to mark-to-market your hedges on the income statement and run that through the income statement. So we're basically not hedging across the quarter anymore.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And can you quantify the impact of Thailand on sales and earnings in the quarter?","James S. Sawyer","Let's see. Probably about, on the earnings side, $3 million to $4 million of operating profit in the quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison of KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","When you think about the restructuring cost-saving efforts you did in Europe, does that position the segment to get back to the low 20s in operating margins once demand hopefully returns over time?","James S. Sawyer","Yes. I think we've got -- I think some of you noticed a long time ago. Europe used to be north of 20% in operating margin percentage, and it's come down for, I would guess I would divide it into 3 reasons. One is just lower capacity utilization, lower volumes and there's a negative operating leverage that comes to margin percentages when volumes go down. And whenever volumes come back, we'll get some of that back, but I don't know when that is going to be. Secondly, pressure on power cost and labor costs, without the ability to retrieve that in pricing, has been an impact on margin percentages. And then lastly, and we haven't talked about this very much, but we have a lot of business development expense going on in Russia right now. We've got 4 projects underway and roughly $5 million of sequential overhead increases from the Russian business development expense, we're just, which we're just going to have to eat until the Russian plants start up, which is really going to be a 2013 phenomenon.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I noticed on your global end market trends for '11 versus '12 that healthcare was the only segment that didn't grow. Is that an area that makes sense for you to stay in longer term?","James S. Sawyer","The, there are basically kind of 2 parts to healthcare: there's the homecare and the institutional healthcare. As you know, we got out of the homecare business in the U.S. We still have a small participation in the homecare business in Canada and Europe and in South America, but it's not all that significant in total size. And the way that we operate it is pretty well integrated with our packaged and merchant gases business. So I think we share their concern that, just like homecare reimbursement rates went significantly down and made it unprofitable in the U.S., that, that could potentially be occurring in Europe as well. In South America, it's all private pay business so that's not an issue there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies.","Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","This is Rob on, Rob Walker, on for Laurence. I guess, first question, kind of given your earnings outlook and the comments around uses of cash, can you remind us what you see as an upper limit in terms of leverage over the next 2 or 3 years?","James S. Sawyer","Okay. Well, first of all, when we look at leverage, we can't really look at our debt-to-capital ratio. It's not indicative of our credit statistics, the way we get rated or anything else. So the more commonly looked-at measure would be debt-to-EBITDA, which is hovering, been hovering in the 1.7x to 1.8x area, which, that combined with our stable cash flows and the diversity of our end markets, gives us an A rating. But actually, our bonds are priced generally at a AA rating so we have no concerns right now about downgrades and all, the rest of that. I believe that we can continue to reinvest at roughly 15%, 16% of sales because we're generating cash flow of roughly 23% to 25% of sales. So we can keep that high reinvestment rate up in capital spending, at the same time, increase the dividend, and at the same time, buy back roughly 2% of the shares outstanding while still staying in the 1.7x to 1.8x debt-to-EBITDA kind of a range. Now we could go up to 2 if we wanted to, that wouldn't be a problem, but I don't think we're going to need to.","Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then just in terms of China, does the recent difficulty in getting pricing there make any of your projects in the backlog look less attractive?","James S. Sawyer","No. First of all, most of the projects in the backlog or all of the projects in the backlog are really supported by on-site contracts where the pricing is locked in escalation formulas. It's in the merchant products. And some of these on-site projects do have forecasted merchant sales going along with them, but the -- any changes in price take place in the merchant products. And the industry structure in China is a little bit different in the U.S. in that there's still a fairly sizable segment of merchant distributors who buy merchant products from tactically owned air separation units of state-owned industries and ship those products to merchant customers. We've got a very deliberate strategy to change that industry structure so that, when we go sign up merchant customers, we sign up customers like we do in the U.S. where we own the tank at the customer and we enter into a long-term fixed price contract with the customer. So it's something that we've been finding hard to do every month when we look at our China results in the merchant business. One of our key indicators is an improving percentage of merchant sales where we're going direct to the end customer and where we own the tank and we have a contract. It's in the other part of it where there are some distributors in the middle and where we've got some competitors who just start up a plant and dump the product on the market with the distributor, that's tends to be where the pricing softness can come from.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of questions on currency, just to clarify the response to a previous question. It sounds like you do not have currency hedges in place. I seem to recall that, at one point in time, Praxair was hedging, at least partially, at about 3 months. And I'm wondering whether or not there was a change in that paradigm at some point perhaps related to volatility in the markets?","James S. Sawyer","Right. Well, we've tended to hedge out 3 to 6 months, but what happens is that, if the currency changes take place evenly across the quarter, that can work for you. But if the currency changes take place sort of abruptly in the last minute, last month of the quarter, then you can end up increasing your volatility of earnings from the hedges. So we're not trying to be currency traders, we're not trying to out-guess the markets and currencies. So a couple of times, we\u2019ve found that we've increased volatility rather than decreased it. So we've just shortened any currency hedges so we stay within quarter.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I see. And then just to follow up, Jim, obviously, there has been a lot of volatility in those markets since early September. For what it's worth, they've come back your way, at least partially, on a year-to-date basis. And so I'm wondering, in crafting your guidance, are you kind of marking currency at year-end '11? Or is that up to recent business stages because the changes have been rather sharp there?","James S. Sawyer","Well, I think what's a little bit confusing is most people are focusing on the euro currency, okay, and that's not a big issue for us. It's actually come back up to close to 130, so it's a little better than it was before, but that's only been about a 5% change. The currencies that have hurt our guidance are the Brazilian real and Mexican peso primarily, but added to that, the Korean won and the Indian rupee, and they really haven't recovered yet. I'm hoping that they will, but our guidance is based on sort of rates as of today in those currencies.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And then finally, Jim, your depreciation declined about $7 million or so sequentially. Is that simply dollar strength, or are there other factors at work there?","James S. Sawyer","That's simply dollar strength. You just take the same percentage on, that we applied to sales and apply that to depreciation, you'll get the same answer.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. First, Jim, the FX issues, does that compromise any of your customers' ability to export product? Or do you think that's a pretty negligible issue?","James S. Sawyer","Well, I would say this: I think we'd say that the real got so strong during 2011 that it did compromise the ability of our steel customers in Brazil to export product and that's really why they started taking these curtailments. Now the real's weakened by about 15%, 20% since that and so I think that puts the Brazilian suppliers in a little bit better position than they were in before. But at the same time, with the dollar getting stronger, it hasn't really impacted our U.S. customers. I think what's happening is that the U.S. economy's really taking a lead in this recovery and I think the U.S. economy will be one of the stronger economies in 2012 and I think currency traders are starting to factor that in. And that's what's -- why the dollar is getting stronger again. But I don't see -- I think what we had -- I think any pain that we had relative to currencies impacting our customers, we already had in Brazil in 2011.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And in Europe, have you gotten to the point where there's anybody hitting take-or-pay thresholds?","James S. Sawyer","No, no.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then in the U.S. market, there\u2019s a lot of chemical expansion activity. Have you guys seen an increase in the hydrogen off-gas availability? Or is there an opportunity to grab some of that?","James S. Sawyer","We have not -- I think there's a lot of talk about some expansions and there are a couple of projects that are coming back on, that had been mothballed for a while and are coming -- a couple of plants have been mothballed for a while that are coming back on-stream, but we don't see that as being any significant source of byproduct hydrogen for us to buy. On the contrary, the low natural gas prices make the demand and the value of import higher than into the refinery, higher than it would otherwise be if gas prices were higher because they don't have to pay as much for the hydrogen relative to the price of oil.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Edward Yang of Oppenheimer.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have already been answered, but maybe just looking at North American margins, that ticked up nicely during the quarter. And I believe 26%, that is a record quarterly margin for you there. So what was driving that strength?","James S. Sawyer","Yes, I mean, we're really happy. Our North American team has done a wonderful job. That's an all-time high for the way we define our North American segment, which is Canada, U.S. and Mexico. That increase was partially from the fact that we got out of the home healthcare business in North America which had been a drag to operating profit and margin. But also the result of, as I said before, we're kind of running on all cylinders in North America: Packaged is good, merchant's good, on-site\u2019s good, Canada\u2019s good, the U.S. is good and Mexico is good. And we're getting pretty decent pricing as well.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Are you seeing more margin leverage on the packaged goods side versus on-site and merchant?","James S. Sawyer","I'm sorry, more...","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Operating leverage.","James S. Sawyer","Not as much as we would like to. We've seen more volume growth in packaged gases, but there's been a lot of cost inflation and there's a need to get more price in packaged gases before we're going to start to see a percentage margin improvement in packaged gases.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts of Buckingham Research.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Your comment earlier, that you expect $0.30 from backlog in earnings this year, then over $0.60, I think you said, for next year. So we should expect backlog to sort of plateau out here because it sounds like a kind of a surge in start-ups in late 2012 and early 2013?","James S. Sawyer","That's correct. And if you think about it, the, most of the projects that we started up over the last 2 or 3 years were commissioned before the recession, okay? You went into the recession, and in 2009 and 2010, there were few contract signings because customers all over the world weren't really interested in making commitments to build new things. As we moved into 2011 and right around year end last year, we signed the 2 very large contracts with Valero as well as a number of contracts in South America and Asia as well as the contracts in Russia. And so with the 2-year gestation period, those are going to be a bigger wave of start-ups in the fourth quarter of 2012 and in the first half of 2013. We just didn't have a lot of start-ups in 2011.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Got it. And then the inventory correction in the chemicals market that affected the end of the quarter, in January, have you seen the activity reaccelerate there?","James S. Sawyer","Wait, I'm not really up to date on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Manthey of Robert Baird.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","The first question is, the price increases you've announced for Europe, could you talk about the magnitude of those announcements? And second, was there any measurable impact from the helium shortages during the quarter?","James S. Sawyer","Right. Well, the price increases in Europe are going to be similar to North America where people who've got contracts rolling over and so forth, they could be 10% to 15% to 20%, but that won't be what you'll be able to average across the whole business. Helium is an interesting product. I think we are the most backward-integrated producer of helium in the industrial gas industry. And so we've been kind of the supplier who\u2019s always had supply when customers needed supply. And customers have been very thankful for that because other times and some other suppliers run out of helium, the customer gets cut off and he comes back to us. So we didn't have any impact from helium. And the one thing we have been doing is raising the price of helium, but we started doing that earlier in 2011 and we expect to continue that into 2013. I think, with that, we're well past the noon hour. And we'd like to thank everybody for joining the call today. And if you have any follow-up questions, please reach out for Kelcey or myself. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

My name is Sarah, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Kelcey Hoyt, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Kelcey E. Hoyt","Thanks, Sarah. Good morning, and thank you for attending our third quarter earnings call and webcast. I'm joined this morning by Matt White, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Liz Hirsch, our Vice President and Controller.","Today's presentation materials are available on our website at praxair.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference.","In addition, please note that quarterly and full year year-over-year guidance comparisons include adjustments in 2013 and the reconciliation to the U.S. GAAP reported numbers are in the Appendix to this presentation and the press release.","Matt and I will now review Praxair's third quarter results, including the current business environment and updated earnings guidance. At the end of the prepared remarks, we'll be available to answer questions. [Operator Instructions]","Matthew J. White","Thanks, Kelcey, and good morning, everyone. Praxair delivered record earnings per share of $1.62, and again delivered a solid quarter with year-over-year sales growth of 5% and operating profit growth of 6%, excluding currency. We achieved a 2% price improvement globally. Trends are improving in the U.S. and India, where we are very well-positioned to capture our fair share of the growth.","In more challenged countries, we will continue to prudently manage our costs and take actions consistent with prior years. This relentless focus on cost management enabled us to reduce our SG&A spending levels and improve our operating margins from the prior year quarter.","We generated strong operating cash flow of 23% of sales, which enabled us to fund our growth capital and returned almost $300 million to our shareholders without impacting our debt levels. While we had a solid third quarter, we continue to face challenging macroeconomic conditions in certain markets. The energy market in Mexico has not yet recovered to levels we're accustomed to, given the continued government budgetary constraints. Brazil and Italy are in technical recessions and China growth has been decelerating. Overall, most emerging markets have not been growing to their potential.","Developed markets, with the exception of the U.S., had been only moderately growing at best. Commodity pricing has been unpredictable, which impacts the investment confidence and timing of our customer base. And now, we are see seeing significant devaluations of most foreign currencies. The cumulative effect of these events has led to a reduction in our fourth quarter earnings guidance.","And while it may be difficult to be bullish on emerging markets right now, I'm confident in Praxair's ability to continue to generate attractive margins and healthy free cash flow in these difficult conditions. We'll continue to manage the things that have enabled our industry-leading position, which include operational excellence and disciplined capital allocation. And when these markets do recover, we will not miss a beat. In fact, we will be rewarded with higher accretive earnings since our productivity efforts will make us leaner.","So in summary, all of these factors result in Praxair still being the best-performing industrial gas company, and we expect to stay that way.","And now, I'd like to hand it off to Kelcey to walk through the financial results.","Kelcey E. Hoyt","Thanks, Matt. Please now turn to Slide #3 for our consolidated results. Sales for the quarter were $3.1 billion; and organic growth excluding currency of 5% came primarily from higher price across all operating segments and higher volumes, including new plant start-ups in the Americas and Asia.","Sales growth was stronger in the manufacturing, food and beverage and health care end markets. Sequentially, sales grew 2% ex currency from higher volumes in North America, South America and Asia, partially offset by seasonally lower volumes in Europe.","Operating profit was $711 million, 5% above the prior year quarter. Excluding currency, operating profit growth of 6% was driven by higher volume, price, productivity gains and fixed cost management. The EBITDA and operating margins were strong and grew to 32.5% and 22.6%, respectively.","Net income of $477 million grew 6% from the prior year, greater than operating profit growth, as higher interest expense was more than offset by growth in equity affiliate income, primarily in Asia, and less noncontrolling interest due to the acquisition earlier this year of the remaining noncontrolling interest in a U.S. packaged gas distributor.","Our key leverage metrics including the debt-to-capital ratio increased sequentially to 55.7% despite higher net income through the impact of negative currency translation on the capital base, while the debt-to-EBITDA ratio slightly improved to 2.2x.","Earnings per share of $1.62 were 7% above the prior year and grew faster than net income due to a 1% reduction in a number of diluted shares outstanding as a result of net repurchases of common stock. $1.3 billion remains available under the current $1.5 billion share repurchase program. Cash flow from operations were strong at $713 million. This funded $436 million of capital expenditures and acquisitions to support growth.","During the quarter, we paid dividends of $189 million and repurchased $100 million worth of stock, net of issuances. Our after-tax return on capital this quarter was 12.6%, consistent with the first and second quarters of this year. We expect return on capital to improve as earnings grow. For the quarter, our return on equity was 28.2%.","Our profit backlog is currently $1.9 billion and well-diversified across all geographies, with roughly 1\/3 of the CapEx investment in North America, 1\/3 in Asia and the remainder in South America and Europe. These projects will serve a balanced set of customers in the energy, chemical, manufacturing, electronics and metals industries.","In addition to the existing backlog projects, we are developing new opportunities to fuel growth with the constant goal of building density and obtaining synergies between the new and base business. The more active bidding regions currently include India and the U.S. Gulf Coast. Opportunities exist in the energy, manufacturing, metals and chemicals end markets.","These potential projects tend to be large for our customers as well as Praxair and are taking longer to close. Customers are reviewing their refreshing cost estimates for their own plant economics, especially given high cost of construction in certain geographies and ever-changing macro conditions. The timing of when these potential projects will be added to our backlog varies. Some projects are in contract negotiation for final terms and conditions, and others are still in the early phase of the bid process. As such, we still expect that the backlog could go up or down in a quarter, depending on the exact timing of final contract execution and existing backlog project start-ups.","In addition, our small on-site plant growth platform for new plants that are too small to be included in the backlog is currently at about $60 million in CapEx, with a little more than 15 projects under long-term contracts that will start up over the next 12 months. The majority of existing projects are located in North and South America, with additional opportunities globally.","Please turn to Slide 4 for our results in North America. Sales in North America were $1.6 billion, 3% above the prior year quarter, and up 4%, excluding negative currency translation. Organic sales growth of 2% was driven by higher pricing and volume growth in United States and Canada. Sales grew to manufacturing, metals, food and beverage and healthcare markets.","Higher energy-related sales in the United States and Canada were mostly offset by weaker energy sales in Mexico. As of the third quarter, both significant hydrogen project start-ups have now been running for a year. One having started in June and one in August, and so these volumes will now be included in year-over-year comparisons going forward.","Acquisitions, primarily U.S. packaged gas distributors, contributed 1% growth. Higher cost pass-through, largely higher natural gas prices passed through to hydrogen customers, increased sales by 1%. Sequentially, organic sales increased 2%, with the strongest end market sales growth to metals and food and beverage customers.","U.S. merchant volumes grew 3% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, with broad-based product growth strongest in metals, energy, manufacturing and food and beverage end markets. We've been able to take advantage of strong liquid argon demand due to operational excellence, diversity and supply sources and recent production capacity increases identified through productivity initiatives.","Food and beverage-related growth is driven both by new application technology and our new CO2 acquisition from early last year. Canadian merchant volumes grew year-over-year and sequentially, with strength in liquid nitrogen for fracking.","This quarter, we continue to see significant softness in our Mexico merchant oil well services business as our key customer, PEMEX, has continued limited production at certain fields due to budget constraints. Volumes to oil well service customers are below last year by double-digit percentage. Excluding negative oil well service volumes, organic sales to other end markets in Mexico, which is manufacturing and health care, have continued to grow.","U.S. packaged gas organic sales grew by 5% year-over-year, with gas and rent [ph] up 6%, and hard goods up 3%. In addition, acquisitions contributed 3% growth year-over-year. Organic growth was more heavily weighted to volume and price. The organic U.S. packaged gas growth was broad-based and strongest to customers in transportation, metal fabrication and machinery. Sales to energy, chemicals, health services and education such as welding schools also continue to grow.","North American operating profit was $416 million, 2% above the prior year quarter, and up 3%, excluding negative currency translation impact. The increase was primarily driven by higher pricing. The price environment remains positive and we are gaining traction on our recent price announcements. The year-over-year margin declined 20 basis points, in part due to headwinds from higher natural gas cost pass-through as well as the prior year quarter contract termination settlement. Segment operating margin was strong at 25.4%.","During the third quarter, we expanded our production network in Canada, with the start-up of a new 325-ton per day air separation plant that will supply gaseous oxygen and nitrogen to Vale, at its new nickel processing facility. Vale is utilizing a new hydrometallurgical process that uses oxygen to remove sulfur and iron from the nickel. This method makes it possible to process the nickel or concentrate directly into finished metal without having to smelt it first, avoiding sulfur dioxide and dust emission. Praxair's new plant will also serve merchant and packaged gas customers in a variety of sectors, including healthcare, offshore energy, metal fabrication and food and beverage.","Proposal activity for new on-site plants in North America remains solid in the chemicals and energy market relocated primarily in the U.S. Gulf Coast region as well as smaller on-site plants for manufacturing.","Now please turn to Page 5 for our results in Europe. Our European segment sales regenerated about 50% from Spain and Italy combined and the other half in Scandinavia, Germany, Benelux and most recently, Russia, which is still quite small. Sales in Europe were steady with the prior year quarter and grew 2%, excluding negative impacts of currency and cost pass-through. Organic sales were 2% above the prior year quarter due to price attainment and modest volume growth in most countries. Sales growth was driven by metals, food and beverage, healthcare and manufacturing end markets.","Sequentially, volumes were lower due to the obvious holiday season.","Operating costs of $71 million was up 11% for the third quarter, demonstrating strong operating leverage on modest growth and higher pricing and reflecting net density and efficiency benefits from the divestiture of our industrial gas business in France to Messer and acquisition of Messer's assets in Italy. New project bidding is active in Russia and Northern Europe, with most opportunities related to smaller on-site plants for manufacturing customers.","Page 6 shows our results in South America. South American segment sales were $523 million. Organic sales, excluding currency translation, grew 8% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Strong price of 5% year-over-year and 3% sequentially included recovery of high inflation, largely in Venezuela and Argentina. South America volume growth of 3% year-over-year was about 2\/3 from Brazil and 1\/3 from the countries outside of Brazil. Praxair Brazil outperformed the estimated negative 4% industrial production in the quarter, driven by growth in health care and food and beverage end markets and application technologies. These were partially offset by weaker demand from metals customers. Merchant and packaged gas sales grew year-over-year and sequentially, while on-site sales were down year-over-year and steady sequentially.","Operating profit in South America increased 5%, excluding currency effects, as higher pricing and volumes were partially offset by cost inflation. The operating margin was strong at 22.6%, even with the challenging economic environment.","As we look forward to the fourth quarter, our expectations for Brazil include currency translation headwinds year-over-year and sequentially, given the approximate 10% devaluation of the reais since mid-July. We're expecting sequential volume declines in conjunction with extended holiday production curtailment by customers, primarily in the metals and manufacturing end markets. This is consistent with prior years.","And with the elections now behind us in Brazil, we are not expecting any fourth quarter volume impact. However, we look forward to 2015 as the president identifies the new Finance Minister and begins to layout and implement her prospective agenda. Regardless, the business has and will continue to take action as needed to adjust to changing economic conditions, including cost reductions and continued discipline and execution of price and productivity programs.","Please turn to Slide 7 for our results in Asia. Sales of $426 million grew 11% from the prior year quarter. Volume growth of 10% year-over-year was driven by new project start-ups in India and Korea, and included a sale of equipment to our joint venture in China, serving a large chemical complex.","Price contributed to a 1% increase in sales and was primarily driven by helium. China had only modest base volume growth during the quarter, attributable to slowing macro conditions and our ongoing efforts to shift merchant sales from distributor channel to direct-served customers. Application technologies are driving growth to end users in the areas of combustion, metal fabrication and water.","India represents about 20% of the Asia segment sales for Praxair. Volumes grew 15% year-over-year, including project start-ups and 6% sequentially. Organic growth was strongest in metals and manufacturing end markets.","Asia's operating profit of $75 million increased 12% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to the impact of higher volume and pricing. On-site project bidding activity in Asia includes energy, metals, electronics and chemical companies, as well as smaller on-site plants for environmental benefits such as wastewater treatment and the manufacturing end market.","Our results for Surface Technologies are shown on Page 8. Surface Technologies sales for the quarter were $171 million, with organic sales growth of 3%, due primarily to higher pricing and coatings volume growth to energy and aerospace customers. Operating profit of $31 million increased 11% on higher volume, pricing and productivity improvement.","And now, I'll turn the call back to Matt to discuss our updated earnings guidance.","Matthew J. White","Please turn to Slide 9. Our earnings guidance for the fourth quarter is for EPS in the range of $1.53 to $1.60, which is about $0.10 lower than the implied guidance when using our prior full year projection. Approximately half of the impact is due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and the other half is due to a lack of recovery in key emerging markets, most specifically Mexico energy and Brazil.","The month of September saw significant selloff in global currencies, especially those related to commodity-linked countries. We included in the Appendix a summary of foreign currency movements since we provided our prior guidance back in July. You can see our major currencies devalued anywhere from 5% to 10%. This is a significant move, especially for such a short time period. Like many others, we simply haven't seen improvement in key emerging markets. Budgetary constraints with PEMEX continue to hinder onshore well stimulation, which negatively impacts our Mexican energy business. This is down about 30% year-over-year.","And last July, we anticipated that Brazil would recover from the production curtailment after the World Cup and get back to about 0% industrial production. But instead, we have seen negative 4% to negative 5% figures every month. We also included a chart in the Appendix, where you can see that the majority of 2014 has been a technical recession for Brazil. Therefore, our current assumptions are that these trends will not reverse, but rather continue into the fourth quarter.","On the bright side, the U.S. continues to grow at mid-single digits and we are able to achieve positive price increases across the globe, in addition to our ongoing cost actions and productivity initiatives.","Using this updated fourth quarter outlook results in current 2014 full year EPS guidance to be in the range of $6.23 to $6.30, which represents 5% to 6% growth. Excluding negative currency translation, our full year EPS growth rate is projected to be 8% to 9% above 2013.","Before we go to Q&A, I'd like to highlight some key year-to-date accomplishments. We have successfully started up 9 projects from our backlog and integrated several acquisitions around the world. Operating profit margin has expanded 30 basis points to maintain a healthy industry-leading 22.4%. Operating cash flow of $2.1 billion is a robust 23% of sales and funded $1.3 billion of capital expenditures and $1.1 billion in shareholder returns split between dividends and stock repurchases. The key takeaway is that we know how to operate in challenging conditions and we will continue to improve our performance.","And I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Harrison from First Analysis.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","I know it's pretty early since we've had the elections in Brazil, but are you getting any sense that we're starting to get back to business as usual between now and the holidays? And I guess, maybe if you could just give a little more color on your expectations around the holidays. It sounds like you expect that, that typical seasonal weakness, probably not a whole lot worse than in past years, but I know that in the past, we've seen that -- those holiday shutdowns last all the way into Carnival. What are your thoughts there?","Matthew J. White","Yes. So Mike, I think, first of all, you are correct. Our current assumption right now is kind of a continuation of the current trends and then sort of a normal both summer holiday and sort of Christmas break shutdown here in the fourth quarter. Obviously, this is coming off of a lower base than what we've seen in prior years. And as far as the election, clearly, too early, I think, to guess what impact it will have and we really don't anticipate any impact, up or down, here in the fourth quarter. I think, there have been some encouraging signs from President Rousseff as far as trying to work with the other party, trying to have some more pro-business initiatives. I think, Kelcey had mentioned in the prepared remarks, there's 2, I think, very good candidates for Finance Minister. Names are being floated around. I think, that could be beneficial. So we are hoping to see some traction here. And as you know, in the election, it was a very split election between sort of roughly the North and the South in terms of outlook. So I think, if what we're hearing so far kind of carries through, then we hopefully should be able to see some more business reforms, probably some of the social program reforms. Although we will -- we do anticipate we'll see some higher inflation here, at least in the near term, as they work through these. Remains to be seen. And it will be more of a 2015 impact, I think, at this point. But for 2014 and the back of this quarter here, pretty much kind of a continuation of what we have with a normal seasonal impact.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Okay. And then, you noted the sales and operating profit excluding FX for the quarter up 5% and 6%, respectively. That's maybe a little bit less leverage than we've come to expect than you've shown in the past few quarters. What are some of the obstacles that you saw in the quarter to better operating leverage? And as we look into 2015, do you expect that to improve assuming we can still grow volumes at a kind of a low to mid-single-digit rate?","Matthew J. White","So clearly, we are still very focused on generating positive operating leverage. Part of the headwinds that we've had, clearly, the emerging market slowed down, that loss of volume comes at a fairly heavy margin, so by not having that incremental volume, that's a bit of a headwind on the -- on your operating leverage. We've had some start-ups in HYCO here that will be lapped here in the third quarter. But as you know, HYCO is a very pass-through-intensive type of energy, so while it's not much of an operating profit dollar impact on the pass-through, it will dilute your margins a bit. That will be lapped here in the fourth quarter. This was the last quarter of the Valero start-ups. Natural gas is higher year-over-year, so even North America specifically, that's about a 20 to 30 basis point headwind on our operating margins. And some of the unfavorable mix, I mean the Mexican energy headwinds that we're seeing, that tends to be a little bit higher-margin business. That's causing some challenges there as well. So we still are in the mist [ph] like we always are in cost actions and managing our costs around the market outlook. So we still expect to achieve positive operating leverage going forward. And I think, in this quarter, we just -- it wasn't as strong as we'd liked.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Matt, I was wondering, in your Appendix, you talked about the individual end markets around the chemical side, you mentioned the North American growth offset by Europe in customer maintenance. Can you give us a sense of what the customer concentration is in that end market in Europe? I would have thought maybe you could still see some growth there, but is there just 1 or 2 customers that are a big chunk of the business in that industry?","Matthew J. White","Yes. As you know, Bob, we don't have a very large presence in Europe. So some of our on-site chemical customers tend to be larger enclaves. So a few of them could move that particular end market for Europe a little more than some of the other regions where we are larger. And as far as the U.S. here, we've seen some good growth there. Coming into the fourth quarter that we are expecting a bit more turnaround than normal, especially in the energy space in the Gulf area. So -- but I wouldn't look into that anymore in Europe than it's just a couple concentrated pet chem enclaves where we're seeing a little bit of that.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And can you talk about what you see on the CapEx profile looking forward? I know you'd guided up to $2.2 billion, and then it came back a little $2 billion, I see what you guided for this year in your Appendix. What do you think in '15 and beyond, how does that CapEx number look?","Matthew J. White","For capital expenditures?","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, sir.","Matthew J. White","I think, right now, our latest number is around $1.7 billion, $1.8-ish billion, in that range. And it just really depends on the timing of some of the projects. I don't anticipate much of a difference from where we are now, kind of the run rate into the fourth quarter. We'll give more clear guidance in January, on 2015, but if we continue to see kind of some of the delays in signings, the number could be a bit lower. However, if we do start to sign some of these Gulf projects, it could spike up, especially with some of the pre-ordering of equipment. So remains to be seen. Right now, though, based on conditions that we're looking at, I'd expect it to be roughly consistent, plus or minus a few hundred million.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Regarding Asia, you referenced sale of equipment to a joint venture in China. Would you comment on the trend of underlying volume growth in Asia and\/or China, excluding the equipment sales?","Matthew J. White","Sure. The equipment sale is probably about 2\/3 of that. And like you said, that was to one of our JVs. Some of the offsetting benefit to that would be in equity income as they start to ramp up their volumes. But underlying trends right now, I think, what we're seeing is our on-site customers continue to run fairly well. On the merchant front, it still is challenging given the supply\/demand situation. There's just, frankly, excess supply in several regions, due to some of the customer-owned liquefaction capacity. And as Kelcey had mentioned in the prepared remarks, we continue to pursue a channel strategy to shift more of our liquid direct and away from the distributor market. So that may hinder or be a bit of a headwind on our top line growth, but we still firmly believe it's going to help expand our margins and help improve our returns overall. As far as the on-site opportunities in China, kind of going forward, some of the big coal gasification projects, as you know, we've been quite selective on those. And I think, that was a good move on our part as several have been delayed some significantly. Permitting is still very challenging in China, given some of the environmental and corruption crackdown initiatives. So our view at this point is we probably see more smaller type assets that we would install small standard plants like our VPSA's end plant and more of an integrated density play. So that's kind of where we see it going, probably not growing at the same clip, maybe low-single digit to mid-single digit, but we're looking to improve profitability and our returns there.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's quite helpful. As a follow-up, shifting gears to Mexico. How large are your energy-related sales in Mexico as a base would you say? And then, on the trajectory, it sounded like, last quarter, you were hopeful that maybe you'd start to see some improvement. Now it appears that's not the case, at least for 4Q. How are you thinking about deeper into '15 and whether or not we'll eventually see some rebound there?","Matthew J. White","As far as percentage of our sales, it's roughly 1\/4 to 1\/3 when you add all forms of energy sales. So direct to PEMEX, as well as indirect to, say, service companies, so that's kind of a rough size of that component of the business. Looking at our thoughts back in July sort of versus now, if you may recall, in July, it was still kind of early in the reform and there was not clarity around the secondary laws. And at the time, our thought process was once there was clarity around the secondary laws, you would see some recovery of the activity levels in onshore. And what the least we've seen now is while there has been some clarity, budgetary constraints is still weighed heavily on this and it's kind of continued to be less activity and we're kind of at a bottom right now, I would say, in terms of the activity levels we're seeing. So our view is we just don't see it ticking up here in the fourth quarter. But you look at a company like PEMEX, it is a substantial portion of the tax revenue for a country like Mexico. It is a very, very important part of the economy there. So we don't believe this to be a long-term trend. We think it is more of a sort of short-term cyclical item. So we still think, in '15, it will be better. We're in the midst of developing our kind of '15 outlook on this and we'll give more clarity in January. But right now, we do expect recovery in '15, although, clearly, we'll have some tougher comps to lap in Q1 and Q2 of '14 when we were running at sort of normal levels.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Do you plan to change your absolute level of debt? Do you want to reduce your net debt or do you want to keep it at the same level? What do you plan to do with your capital structure?","Matthew J. White","So from a net debt perspective, right now, we're kind of keeping it around that $9 billion, plus or minus a few hundred million. We have been looking to term out commercial paper shorter-term debt where it makes sense. But right now, that general area is sort of an area where we're fairly comfortable in. We're not looking to expand it rapidly, but at the same token, I'm not looking to really decrease it either.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess, I should have been more precise. You generate a reasonable amount of free cash flow and the question is what you're going to do with it? You've got a share repurchase authorization, you can make acquisitions. Do you plan to allocate any of this for debt pay down?","Matthew J. White","No. I mean, again, if we're going to hold our net debt levels at this point, the view is there won't be significant allocation on a net-debt basis if that number essentially holds.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then, lastly, can you talk about what's happened to on-site volumes in the United States in the quarter? And what your outlook is for them?","Matthew J. White","So on-site volumes in third quarter, I think, it was a bit mixed. We saw some fairly good volumes in the Gulf. We had some challenges in steel and that was primarily due to some customer outages, some unplanned customer outages. But our expectation is that in fourth quarter, that the steel will recover and we've been seeing that. But as I mentioned earlier, we do see some fairly large hydrogen customer outages in the Gulf, primarily refiners that are taking some opportunistic turnarounds. So I think, steel, we'll see some recovery since these customer assets are back running and they want to run. And on the refining side, I think, it's just some turnarounds and some outages that will reduce those volumes a bit there in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Gulley from BGC Financial.","Mark R. Gulley - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","I have 2 questions that kind of relate to the Investor Day about 13 months ago. At that time, you established a 2017 sales goal of about $17 billion. And of course, there have been some speed bumps since then that you talked about already this morning. So based upon 2014, you'd need a CAGR of 9% to get to that goal, is it time now to kind of back off that $17 billion sales goal in 2017?","Matthew J. White","Yes, Mark, the way I kind of look at it is we have been, over the last year, sort of guiding toward the high-single-digit sales target. And granted, 9% to get to that $17 billion is on the top end of that. But when I break down the components of that high-single-digit number and look at the pieces, of which, it's organic growth project contribution, acquisitions and price. I think, from an acquisitions and price standpoint, we're pretty much hitting where we expected. And at this point, we haven't seen any reason to think differently on that front. I think, the base volume piece has been more challenging and clearly the emerging markets. As you may recall, we had sort of to build that high-single-digit number look to be sort of 2% to 3% on base volume growth and we're operating lower than that and it's a combination of some South American macro challenges, this cyclical Mexican energy situation and you are seeing some decelerations in China. So I think, that has made that piece of the pie a little more difficult. And on the project piece, I think, the delays are stretching it out a bit. So we do expect to sign projects and get our backlog back up, but probably will push out the contribution a bit. So we'll give more clarity in January, on '15. But when we look out a few years, we still think that high single digit, now that would be more 7%, 8%, 9% kind of number, it's feasible, but we're going to have these challenges in the macro front and potentially timing of project contribution.","Mark R. Gulley - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. Now also, at the Investor Day, you indicated the share count reduction goal of 1% to 2% per year. Quite frankly, you've been running at the very low end of that for some time. I think, maybe going back to 2012. So there have been some questions on capital allocation already. How are you thinking about's share repurchases going forward to stand at that 1%? Or perhaps moving up towards the 2%?","Matthew J. White","Yes. So right now, our view is to clearly still stay in the range, 1% to 2%, and we are in that range currently. And it's kind of an overall, as you can imagine, capital allocation structure. So if we do see our CapEx declining a bit, that number will continue to go up. But we do look to keep raising our dividend every year in line with earnings, which is another component of the use of cash. And to the question earlier, we're looking to roughly maintain our net cash debt position. We're not looking to lever that up too much. I mean, it may go up a bit, it may go down a little bit, and it will bounce around, but we're going to stay in that kind of general range. So if there -- if you envision a scenario with a lower CapEx, this number will climb a lot. If CapEx were to stay roughly flat and our operating cash flow grows at this rate, this number will climb a bit. So it just remains to be seen how those numbers work out, but our intention is absolutely continue in this range.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Sheehan from SunTrust.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just on the Lin\/Lox operating rates, could you give us a sense for what those were like in your outlook going forward given the macro situation?","Matthew J. White","Yes. Sure. So kind of looking at some of the rates around the world. And as I've mentioned in prior calls, these are kind of different within each region, but we try to sort of give a generic average rate across. So even within each region, it could be quite different. But North America is low 80s and creeping up a little bit as we've seen kind of mid-single-digit merchant numbers in the U.S. So that's been driving some positive outlook there. Also, argon is quite tight in the U.S. today. So we've been essentially selling a significant amount of argon, which is also keeping the utilizations up a little bit. South America right now, mid-80s. And again, this is on the Lin\/Lox LAR now. And we are seeing in South America, on-site is more sluggish. We probably have a handful of maybe 4 or 5 customers that are sort of below M top levels given some of the challenges in steel in Brazil right now, especially around flat for the auto and somewhat along related to construction. But the merchant still runs quite well and a lot of that is servicing healthcare, food, beverage, which, as you saw on our end markets, continue to do quite well being the noncyclical type of industries that they are. Europe is mid-70s right now, kind of spread across the North and South combined. We're seeing very high utilization still in Russia. Utilization is a little bit lower in the South and a little bit better in the North. And Asia is kind of a mix, depending upon the country. But when you add it all together, probably high 70s right now, and part of this is part of, I mentioned earlier, our channel strategy on merchant liquid by pursuing more of a quality approach. We are just selling less liquid, so our utilizations there will drop a little. But clearly, we have ample capacity around the world. And when these markets do recover, we're very well-positioned to be able to supply the liquid end of the market for it.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Terrific. And also, you talked a little bit about your return on capital. What do you see as the trend going forward over the next 12 months or so, given the current macro headwinds you're seeing?","Matthew J. White","Yes. I think, our expectation is still that will improve. Clearly, it's got 2 parts to the equation, the NOPAT in the numerator and then the capital base in the denominator. And we expect to continue to grow NOPAT. So in fact, if you look at our sort of, some people call it instantaneous calculation this quarter, that was a nice improvement, it just wasn't enough to weigh enough into the average calculation. But we do expect to climb that up. But it's a slow climb, as you imagine, it's a 5-quarter trailing capital base that you have to overcome. So we do expect to continue to bring it up and that's a very important metric for our presidents around the world that they are compensated on So we're going to continue to work to improve that.","Operator","Next question comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.","George D'Angelo - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","This is actually George D'Angelo on for Laurence today. Given oil price declines, have you seen any projects there in your backlog, maybe thinking about when they would start producing their CapEx? Is there a peg for at what oil price you would really start to see some changes there?","Matthew J. White","So I think, lower oil price actually had impact us a couple of different ways, in addition to probably just the backlog. I'll kind of try and briefly touch on some of them. Clearly, currency, any commodity-linked countries sort of getting the currency headwind and that for the most part is reflected in our outlook in numbers, as you've seen the real, the Canadian dollar, Mexican peso, sort of selloff. But looking at sort of other impacts, I think, there's 3 kind of potential impacts for us, the sort of our current customer base, our potential future customer base related to backlogs and projects, and then just sort of the aggregate demand across our portfolio. So when you first start with the sort of aggregate demand across the portfolio, lower energy costs should bode well for a good portion of our customer base, in manufacturing, transportation. And consistent with what we've seen with our sort of diverse portfolio, we tend to see both positives and negatives with moves in commodities like this, up or down. So I think, we'll probably see some positive pickup on that side. Now when you look at the direct impact to energy customers, our current energy sales are about 13% to that end market, which is roughly $1.5 billion in the top line. So about 2\/3 of that is downstream. So that's primarily hydrogen and a little bit of oxygen and nitrogen mostly into the refining space. So we don't really anticipate much of a negative impact in the refining space. I mean, some could argue that they might benefit here on spreads given lower feedstock costs. But at this point, we're not anticipating much of a change in the refining behavior. So the remaining third is mostly upstream with a little bit of midstream. And the upstream is kind of spread all over. It's primarily Canada, U.S., Mexico. It's a combination of our offshore business with Dominion, our packaged business to the well site, and it's also CO2 and nitrogen that we're putting downhaul for either EOR or fracturing. So that one clearly will have some impact, but it's hard to gauge because our customers are -- have different products. Some are going oil, some are going NGLs, some are hedged as far out as 18-plus months. And they all have different well cost to produce. So on a high level, what I'd anticipate is, at this point, we think, we'd probably start to see some impact in the 70s. So think $70 to $80. We'll see some of the higher costs drilling areas, probably Northern Canada, start to tone it down a bit. Then if we get into the 60s, we might see another tranche of spot producers that have higher costs. And then, if we get down into the 50s, we'd probably see a more significant impact as well. So I think, the impact would be gradual. It would step down and it would impact everyone differently. I think, Mexico right now, we're sort of at a floor already. And that's been more government budgetary-driven than commodity price-driven. So really, it's more U.S. and Canada at this point, I think, that are -- that will be impacted. And then, as far as to your specific question on project, current backlog projects are mostly all downstream in the refining space. And then, future opportunities, we're looking at the vast majority of either refining or petchem. And those are more long-range kind of secular plays and that we're really basing it on the low-cost feedstock. So clearly, their end plastics products may go up or down on oil. But they're really, I think, chasing a low-cost feedstock and that's what's attractive to them. So it remains to be seen, but at this point, we're not hearing anything on those projects to the contrary.","George D'Angelo - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful. And can you guys just provide a little bit of granularity in manufacturing to your largest end market and just kind of what was accelerating, what was decelerating within that end market?","Matthew J. White","Sure. U.S. has been good. We've seen manufacturing across the board do well, especially areas like manufacturing for transportation, so automotive, railcars. And that's been fairly broad-based. South America, it's been okay, some of the manufacturing. But again, they're seeing some pretty big macro headwinds. And I'd say, in other parts of the region, it's been kind of low-single-digit improvement. But really, U.S. has been leading that effort. We're probably seeing some of the best results in the U.S. on manufacturing improvements.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Matt, can you remind us on the new plant impact for 2014 and 2015 on EPS basis in terms of new plant start-ups?","Matthew J. White","Yes. So for 2014, as you know, we've always kind of been giving a range of $0.20 to $0.30. In 2014, we're around the bottom end of that, pretty close to the bottom end of that number. Looking out to '15, expectation is we'd still be in that bottom part of the number as well, given that things are just a little slower to execute and some projects may carry a little bit into next year, and some of the other projects that we'd hope to sign earlier this year that might have smaller turnarounds just drag a little bit. So I think, in both cases, lower end of that number is kind of where we're ending up.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And you mentioned some positive comments on pricing. Would you say the overall pricing environment in industrial gases has improved? And any impact from the new management team at your products in terms of an overall better pricing environment?","Matthew J. White","There's nothing that I could comment on. I've seen from a specific competitor that's maybe overall pricing environment better. But what I can say from at least our view of what we've seen is, clearly, areas with higher inflation, we're getting better pricing. For example, South America. So as inflation gets higher, we should be able to continue to get better pricing. We've made a few announcements here in the U.S. Apparently, our competitors have made some announcements as well. I think, that's based on some of the tightness of supply and also especially around argon is quite tight. So I think, definitely, we're seeing where product is tighter, pricing is better, and where there's higher inflation, pricing is better. And you take an area like China, it's still challenging, pricing. And hence, why we're sort of changing our channel strategy.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Sison from KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Matt, in terms -- when you take a look at the last 3 years, EPS growth is lower than your typical double digits you've done historically. I understand a lot of this is the external environment. But are you seeing anything on a secular basis that maybe is slowing the demand for industrial gases? Or you feel pretty comfortable that as the economy picks up, you can maybe get back on that track?","Matthew J. White","Yes. I think, Mike, you look back a couple of years, first, we've had FX headwinds almost every year. So I think, you probably want to look at that, excluding FX. And as you know, that's primarily translational impact. So excluding that, we've been pretty close to the double digit. Clearly, we've seen some challenging macro conditions as well, think Southern Europe. Obviously, Brazil is kind of going in and out of recessions and sort of back in. So the macro conditions have been slower. The FX headwinds have been greater. And I think, that's really what's been driving it. We haven't seen any change in view or change in technology or just less consumption. I think, what you're just -- from a technological standpoint, what you rather just seen is people aren't running as hard. There's just not as much industrial activity or consumption from some of these, especially emerging markets. I mean, we've seen some very good improvements in some of our markets like the U.S. It's just been the emerging markets have been a challenge.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Great. And then, in terms of the backlog, at what level do you need to keep it at to be able to produce sort of this $0.20 to $0.30 on an annual basis? And when you think about some of the stuff that you're bidding on, is there enough bidding activity in the areas where you can hit your hurdle rates or return profiles to continue to keep that backlog where you want it to be?","Matthew J. White","Yes. I would say we'd probably need a backlog of at least about $2 billion consistently without many delays and how projects start or rollout. So that would be important for that to happen to help contribute to those numbers. And when I kind of look at the type of projects that we are in the midst of bidding, they are larger. They are probably longer in duration, not just design, but some of them potentially to build. So I just think, going forward, it will probably be a little lumpier, just given the size of some of these petchem enclaves.","Operator","Your next question comes from Duffy Fischer from Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just wondering, if you held FX constant where it's at today, roughly how big of a headwind would that be for next year?","Matthew J. White","Yes. Well, Duffy, you could probably do the math based on our filings for what percentage of sales we have in each. But put it this way, when we went from our Q4 guidance to our new guidance and we've called it down $0.10, half of it was FX-related. So you could probably work that math through. But right now, you've got the reais, it's close to BRL 2.50, right. The Canadian dollars bouncing around CAD 1.12. The euro continues to devalue. So it's definitely created some headwinds. But as you know, it's impossible to predict where it will be. We just sort of laid out a view of kind of where the rates have been over the last couple of weeks and that's sort of what we baked in. So I think, if you sort of take those movements in those numbers, you could probably build that into a model.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then, second one, a lot of stuff has changed in the last year. The Russia political stuff. Mexico, weaker. Brazil, weaker. China, weaker. Have your hurdle rates changed in any of these countries as your bidding business versus a year ago?","Matthew J. White","No. As you probably know, the way we've developed our hurdle rates have a component for sovereign risk and currency devaluation risk. So we've always embedded that into our IRR model. So for example, if the U.S. return would be 14%, we might expect a 19% or 20% in a different foreign country because of the devaluation risk. And then, when you look at that on a U.S. basis, it equates back to that U.S. 14%. So what we would do is we would just tweak those devaluation sort of sovereign risk ratings, but that's all that we've really done. And now, when you look at Russia specifically, we're definitely going to be more cautious given the situation there. But frankly, the preventative measures we've taken are playing out. They have been protecting us and they're working. So I think, we anticipated that fairly well. But we're going to continue to be as cautious as we have been, I think. And specific situations like Russia, we're going to add another layer of analysis just to make sure that we're comfortable.","I think, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Our last question comes from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I had a question, just to clarify. So earlier this year, you started out the year with $6.25 to $6.55 guidance. You're cutting $0.25 at the top end. What would you see -- what portion of that is FX versus what portion of that would just be weaker volumes and hence, lower operating leverage potential?","Matthew J. White","Yes. I think, FX is probably close to 3%. And I guess, if you go back to Duffy's question, looking forward, it could be more than that next year, we can just say it that way. But the other challenge that we -- FX year-over-year, by the way, Don, at 3%. I think, the biggest challenge we've had this year on where we started in January to where we are now is really this Lat Am piece. We did not have this PEMEX impact reflected with these volume slowdown. And frankly, we didn't see it until partway through toward the end of Q2. And frankly, we looked at Brazil, you may recall, we said it would be uneven, we said it would be up, we said it would be down. And that was how it started the year. And then, we went to the World Cup, we never quite recovered. And my personal opinion is everything just kind of went on a freeze going into the election. There was a lot of uncertainty, there was a lot of investments being held back. And frankly, I think, there was a lot of overaction in terms of some doom and gloom. Now that, that is behind us, now that there's certainty, I'm hoping that at least bring back some confidence in decision-making. Because that, I think, had a bigger impact on investment over the last 4 to 5 months than it probably should have. And they still have a lot of infrastructure needs. I mean, people forget they still have the Olympics in about 1.5 years, and there's still some significant amount of transportation infrastructure and some of the country infrastructure that they need to spend money on. So that's the big driver, I think, between where we started the year and where we're ended up right now.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And just one follow-up. On packaged gas, you talked about being up 5% year-over-year and flat sequentially. What's the split there between hard goods and gas and rent? And last quarter, you had a pickup in hard goods, which I would have thought would have given you some more growth in gas and rent this quarter, especially with what appears to be some better nonresidential construction data.","Matthew J. White","So on the 5% sort of improvement, about 6% gas, rent and other and 3% is hard goods. And really, what we're seeing on the hard goods side is the majority of this is automation equipment. And I think, what we're seeing more in our customer base is it's not as much adding automation equipment to increase capacity, which would obviously result in incremental gas pull through. I think, it's more putting automation equipment because of either high cost of labor or lack of availability of labor. So think automatic cutters, automatic welders, robotics. So that's a big driver of some of our hard goods and really making our customers more efficient. So that part is not having that big of a pull through, but we still have a very healthy gas number at 6%. As Kelcey have mentioned, we're seeing virtually all markets improving now, even the heavy industry, we're starting to see a little bit of uptick. The only, I'd say, market right now that is still negative for us is the government side. We're just not seeing a lot of activity there. But education, welding schools, universities, spec gases across the whole industrial sector has been quite good and transportation has been very strong. So that's kind of what we've been seeing on that front. But that business continues to perform well.","Kelcey E. Hoyt","Thank you again for participating in our third quarter earnings call.

My name is Sue, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would like to turn the call over to Kelcey Hoyt, Director, Investor Relations. Thank you.","Kelcey E. Hoyt","Thanks, Sue. Good morning, and thank you for attending our first quarter earnings call and webcast. I am joined this morning by Jim Sawyer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Today's presentation materials are available on our website at praxair.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference.","Please also note that our discussion of earnings in the first quarter, including year-over-year and sequential comparisons, excludes the impact of the Venezuelan currency devaluation, which was announced during the quarter. This devaluation resulted in a charge to our earnings of $23 million and $0.08 of earnings per share. A reconciliation of these results to GAAP reported numbers appears in the appendices to this presentation and the press release, including full-year guidance and year-over-year comparison.","Jim and I will now review Praxair's first quarter results, including the current business environment and updated earnings guidance. We'll then be available to answer questions.","James S. Sawyer","Thank you, Kelcey, and good morning, everyone.","Praxair turned in solid results for the quarter despite a landscape of mixed global economic conditions. While North America was the key earnings growth driver in 2012, several weak spots developed in the first quarter, notably reduced drilling activity and consequently lower volumes in our oil service business. Additionally, the machinery and nonresidential construction sectors weakened as a result of deferred capital spending decisions due to the uncertainty of sequestration.","However, our key on-site customers in steel, refineries and chemicals remain strong. China improved substantially during the quarter with significant volume growth and new project startups. Brazil seems to be turning the corner as well with improving results in March, which is a good bellwether for the rest of the year. Europe continued to disappoint and came in well below our expectations. However, our restructuring actions remain underway and we will continue to evaluate the right cost structure for the region. Once we see some volume growth in Brazil and Europe, we'll be able to deliver strong operating leverage to the bottom line.","On March 1, we closed the acquisition of NuCO2. The business operations and growth outlook appear to be as good as, or better, than we anticipated. We expect the business to be accretive to earnings by about $0.02 per quarter going forward.","Looking ahead, we are narrowing our earnings guidance range for the remainder of the year. We're raising the bottom of the range by $0.05 to $5.90 of EPS. This reflects the additional contribution to earnings for the NuCO2 acquisition. We are also lowering the top end by a nickel to $6.05 because we just don't see enough meaningful economic growth for the remainder of the year in the U.S., Canada and Europe. In fact, the IMF just lowered its GDP forecast for every country in which we operate. Therefore, we see less potential for base business volume growth for the remainder of the year. Nonetheless, our earnings guidance implies steep sequential earnings growth to the second, third and fourth quarters. We're confident in delivering these results as projects currently under construction start up. Additionally, we are expecting ongoing earnings contribution from pricing programs and productivity improvements. In fact, for the fourth quarter, we expect to be again delivering double-digit earnings growth year-on-year.","And now, I will let Kelcey explain in more detail, her first quarter results.","Kelcey E. Hoyt","Thanks, Jim.","Please turn to Slide 3.","Consolidated sales in the first quarter were $2.9 billion, up 2% versus the prior-year quarter. Foreign-currency translation negatively impacted sales by 2% as foreign currencies, primarily the Brazilian real, was weaker against the U.S. dollar as compared to the prior-year quarter. In the first quarter, we lapped the majority of the currency headwinds from devaluations during 2012. If currencies stay at current levels, we expect minimal currency translation impact for the remainder of the year.","Total Praxair volumes were steady year-over-year and sequentially, and include a negative 1% impact from day count effects. Fewer working days had a more significant impact this year than is typical as last year included an extra day for leap year and Easter occurred at the end of this quarter versus April in 2012. This is incremental to the typical first quarter seasonal effects of the Lunar New Year, Carnival in Brazil and customer turnarounds in North America.","Overall, sales grew 5% excluding currency and the impact of fewer working days. Organic growth came primarily from higher sales to metal, energy, chemicals and manufacturing customers, including new plant startups in Asia and South America. Acquisitions contributed 1% growth, primarily from U.S. packaged gas distributors acquired last year, as well as NuCO2, which closed March 1 of this year.","Sequentially, sales grew 3%, excluding currency and the impact of fewer days primarily from growth in North and South America. In Asia, volumes were lower with the seasonal impacts of the Lunar New Year. Operating profit was $623 million as compared to $627 million in the prior-year quarter.","Excluding currency and day count effects, operating profit was above prior-year driven by price, productivity gains and acquisitions. The EBITDA and operating margins remained strong at 31% and 21.6%, respectively.","During the first quarter, we continued to take advantage of low long-term interest rates, as well as our tight issuance spreads to treasuries, and issued 3 tranches of debt for a total of $1.4 billion, with terms of 3-, 5- and 10-year, and rates of 0.75%, 1.2% and 2.7%.","In addition, we closed the acquisition of NuCO2 and refinanced other long-term GAAP maturities. About 90% of our debt is now termed out with long-term securities. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 55.8% and debt-to-EBITDA was 2.1x.","Net income of $414 million decreased 1% from the prior year, in line with operating profit. Earnings per share of $1.38 was comparable to the prior-year quarter as the impact of lower net income was offset by a 1% reduction in the number of diluted shares outstanding as a result of net repurchases of common stock.","During the quarter, we repurchased $117 million of stock, net of issuances. $833 million remains available under the $1.5 billion share repurchase program authorized in January of last year. Our after-tax return on capital this quarter is 13.3%. There are really 3 factors causing the decline in NOPAT return on capital. First, earnings growth has been mitigated by the recessions in Europe and Brazil. When the volumes come back, we will get strong operating leverage without any new capital.","Secondly, similar to any capital project spend, the acquisition of NuCO2 is dilutive to return on capital and below the corporate average for the first few years.","And lastly, we are moving into the late stage of the CapEx cycle. We have over $2 billion of construction in progress which has not yet started up. This is really a timing issue as the plants begin to start up. Praxair's return on capital will start to trend upward in 2014 and '15 as earnings contribution begin and merchant loadings ramp on our existing capacity plus the new projects.","Now please turn to Page 4 for our results in North America.","Sales in North America were $1.5 billion, 4% above the prior-year quarter. Organic sales were steady as increased price of 3% was offset by similar volume decline. Acquisitions grew sales 3%, including packaged gas distributors, plus the acquisition of NuCO2, micro-bulk carbon dioxide, which closed on March 1 of this year. Refinery and chemical customer maintenance programs reduced on-site volumes 6% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Pipeline oxygen sales to steel mills remain very strong. With low-cost natural gas, our steel mill customers are utilizing increased natural gas injection in their blast furnaces in lieu of coal. Natural gas in the blast furnace requires about 25% more oxygen than coal. Merchant volumes were steady year-over-year as underlying growth was offset by reduced frac-ing activity in the United States.","U.S. packaged gas sales grew by 5%, with the net effect of acquisitions and day count contributing 3%. The acquisitions we made in the past year are in the process of being integrated, which will improve profitability. Gas sales were up 6% and hard goods sales were down 5%. The decline in hard goods is a reflection of future uncertainty among business owners, as well as the government, who are postponing purposes of equipment and inventory. In particular, nonresidential construction and machinery are weak. However, the other markets, including general manufacturing, agriculture and oil and gas, are doing well.","North American operating profit was $358 million, 1% below the prior-year quarter. The increase in operating profit from higher pricing, acquisitions and productivity savings was more than offset by lower volumes, partially attributable to fewer working days and higher pension costs.","The operating margin remains very strong at 24.6%. Effective March 1, we acquired NuCO2, the largest provider of fountain beverage carbonation in the United States with approximately 162,000 customer locations. The NuCO2 micro-bulk beverage carbonation offering is a service model of choice for customers offering fountain beverages as it is cost effective, reliable and less labor-intensive for the customer.","85% of NuCO2's business is with restaurant chains and they're well-positioned in the top 100 chains. The revenue model is similar to our industrial gas model, typically 5-year contracts with monthly facility fees that include escalation formulas tied to inflation. We are on track to start the 2 worldscale hydrogen projects under construction for Valero at St. Charles and Port Arthur, and the hydrogen supply to serve Motiva in Louisiana during the second and third quarters. These projects will increase our hydrogen capacity in the United States by more than 25%.","Valero's 2 new hydro crackers will break down hydrocarbon molecules in order to produce more refined gasoline and diesel fuel per barrel of crude input. In addition, we are planning to start up 4 air separation plants in North America during the remainder of 2013.","Proposal activity for new on-site plants in North America remains strong in chemicals, metals, energy and manufacturing. Earlier this week, we announced the signing of a long-term supply agreement with North West Redwater to build, own and operate an air separation unit in Alberta. The plant capacity will be 2,000 tons per day of oxygen, and associated volumes of nitrogen and merchant argon. The North West Redwater gasification process will consume oxygen to produce hydrogen, which is then used to upgrade bitumen to diesel and other higher value hydrocarbon products. Initially, the refinery will convert 50,000 barrels per day of bitumen. The plan is scheduled to start up in mid-2016 and will be Praxair's third worldscale plant in the province.","Now please turn to Page 5 for our results in Europe.","Sales in Europe were 2% below the prior-year quarter. Higher pricing was offset by lower sales volumes due to weaker industrial activity, which resulted in lower packaged gases volumes in Spain and Italy. Fewer working days reduced volumes by 2% versus the prior year. Operating profit of $62 million was down 9% due to the negative operating leverage from lower volumes, higher maintenance costs and startup costs in Russia.","We are in the commissioning phase of starting up our second plant in Russia and are on track to start up a worldscale 3,000 ton per day plant to serve EVRAZ steel early in 2014. Our cost restructuring activities are underway, and we are in the process of consolidating packaged gas facilities in Southern Europe. The segment is well-positioned for margin improvement as volumes stabilize in Southern Europe and we begin to further load the new plants in Russia.","Page 6 shows our results in South America.","South American segment sales were $531 million, 6% below the prior-year quarter due to negative currency impacts of 10%. Underlying sales grew 3% from higher volumes and higher pricing. Higher on-site and merchant liquid volumes increased sales by 2% and were driven by new on-site production facilities. Volumes to packaged gas customers were below prior-year, largely attributable to fewer working days.","By end market, year-over-year sales increased to metals and healthcare customers, and were relatively flat to manufacturing customers. About 20% of Praxair sales in South America come from 8 countries outside of Brazil. Underlying sales in these countries grew 9% versus the prior year and were steady sequentially, with growth in chemicals, food and beverage, healthcare and manufacturing.","Operating profit in South America was $114 million versus $115 million in the prior-year quarter. Currency translation reduced operating profit by 9%. Excluding currency effects, operating profit in the quarter increased 8% from the prior year due to higher productivity, lower energy costs and the result of last year's fixed cost actions.","South America currently has 6 projects in the backlog across 4 countries, which includes Brazil, Peru, Argentina and Uruguay, that will serve the manufacturing and metals market. These projects are scheduled to start up over the next 12 months.","Please turn to Slide 7 for our results in Asia.","Sales of $367 million grew 10% versus the prior-year quarter. Strong volume growth increased sales by 11% due to higher volumes in China, India, Korea and Thailand. New plant startups in China, primarily from metals and chemicals customers, contributed significantly to this volume growth.","Asia's operating profit of $63 million increased 11% from the prior-year quarter. Operating profit improved from higher volumes, partially offset by lower merchant gas pricing primarily in China. China's backlog currently includes 9 projects under contract, including 5,000 tons per day supply to an integrated chemical complex in Chongqing and 3,000 tons per day of oxygen supply to Yangkong for its gasification process.","In India, we have 3 projects under long-term contracts under construction, including 1,800 tons per day of oxygen to supply JSW Steel, 2,500 tons per day of supply to Steel Authority of India and 90 million standard cubic feet per day of hydrogen for Indian Oil.","Korea's backlog includes 4 projects under construction, including 3 plants to serve Samsung for electronics and 1 plant for a manufacturing customer. Our results for Surface Technologies are shown on Page 8.","Surface Technologies sales for the quarter were $163 million, a decrease of 2% compared to the prior-year excluding currency and comps pass through. Higher pricing in the quarter partially offset the impact of lower volumes. Operating profit of $26 million was comparable to the prior year. Lower sales volumes, primarily coatings for industrial and military aviation, were offset by higher pricing and lower cost resulting from productivity and previous restructuring actions.","With that, I'd like to turn this call over to Q&A. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from P.J. Juvekar, Citi.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just quickly, a quick question on China. You saw some good growth in China. I think, Jim, you mentioned that in your prepared remarks. Some of the chemical and industrial companies are not seeing much growth. So is this something related to your business or your project startups that you're seeing better growth than others?","James S. Sawyer","Yes, P.J. I would say that the China -- we basically saw in underlying base business, 0 growth in 2012. We started to see some of the underlying base business pick up in the form of higher merchant volumes and so forth. But the largest share of our improvement in sales and operating profit comes from starting up new plants.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And secondly, your net debt to capital is now 56%. So what is the upper level or upward band where you think you can take this and be comfortable with the ratings?","James S. Sawyer","Right, that's a good question. We still have very strong ratings and we're single A. And if you look at the spreads in treasuries that we issue our bonds at, they are basically as well with any company out there issuing debt, even AAs. And consequently, we have a lot of headroom in order -- if we needed to raise debt. We don't plan on raising debt any higher than this level, but if we needed to raise debt higher than this level, we still got a lot of headroom to stay in the single A category.","Operator","And your next question is from Vincent Andrews, Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Could you talk a little bit about the pace of the business sequentially through the quarter by region? I know you just touched on a little bit in Asia, and maybe more specifically, what happened in March in Brazil? I know some of that is related to seasonality down there, but what is it that gives you the confidence that they're turning the corner?","[Technical Difficulty]","Kelcey E. Hoyt","Vincent, I'm sorry, it's Kelcey Hoyt. We had a technical difficulty with the phone, if you want to go ahead with your question.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","My question is if you could talk a little bit about the pace of business sequentially during the quarter by region. I know you mentioned that Brazil seems to have turned the corner in March, if you can kind of just discuss what gives you the confidence there. And then as we run into April, what are you seeing, and maybe the other piece you could touch is sequestration in the U.S. And at what point do we think we're going to get beyond that absent some change in government policy?","James S. Sawyer","Okay. Well, let me start out with Brazil. It seems to have turned the corner from a very slow 2012 and particularly the fourth quarter, but we did have improvement in March. It is definitely not up to the volumes that we had seen a couple of years ago, but it is up sequentially in March from the third and fourth quarters of last year. And based on what I'm seeing right now, April seems to be a good continuation of March. So I'm expecting that Brazil will do better in 2013 than it did in 2012, but not up to the full potential of prior years. And I'm really speaking about the industrial economy there. There are many, many roadblocks and bottlenecks in the economy, and the federal government is probably the main sponsor of nonresidential construction and they are moving very slowly on -- forward with projects. So that's an issue there and also, the competitiveness of the steel industry is an issue as well. So as I said, we're doing everything we can to offset a relatively weak economy. If you look at the last statistic, industrial production was negative by 4% in Brazil. But we are hopeful that we will become positive as the year progresses. Then North America, I think it's a bit of a puzzle. And I think that anything in construction and military spending in materials is going to be weaker with the government austerity program. It's probably a surprise, but the government accounts for 50% of all nonresidential construction. And about 1\/3 of our products go ultimately, in some way, shape or form, into construction. And so with the austerity programs going on and spending off[ph] , that's not a positive sign. So hopefully, that will straighten out as the year progresses. But the very nice lift that we saw in industrial production in 2011 and 2012 seems to have flattened off, and people are holding back on decisions to invest in new capital. And the leading indicator we have of that is in our packaged gases business, where our gas sales are up but our hard goods sales are down by 4%. And that's kind of a leading indicator of people spending money on capital and equipment. So I think, as I said before, that last year, the big improvements came in North America. I think this year, we're going to have to see more help from South America, Asia, and Europe is really problematic because industrial production is negative in every single country in Europe and negative by 6% in Italy and 8% in Spain. That's a big drop. And that's reflected in our results, as well as many other companies' results. So I think the outlook is cloudy for the whole global construction and industrial machinery area.","Operator","And your next question is from Duffy Fischer, Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A couple of questions. First, a number of other companies have talked about it, you didn't mention it but what do you think the weather effect, particularly in North America, was, where we had a really tough winter this year in the first quarter versus very easy one last year for your business and kind of for your customers' businesses?","James S. Sawyer","I'm not really sure. I think in retrospect, some people said that they thought that last year's first quarter was better than normal seasonality because the weather was warmer, and this year's first quarter didn't match that because the weather was colder. That's probably true, but I don't have any data to support that. But we -- as we said, we also had fewer working days. And the fewer working days is like 2% on sales. But those are sales that come to the bottom line at a 50% operating margin because you don't -- your salaries and so forth is the same. So I think that's a drag in the first quarter for almost every company.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then a question on returns. If you look at the business you've won, business your competitors have won, what would you estimate is the difference in the return that's being bid in on-site projects over the last 2 years versus maybe 4 and 5 years ago? Has there been a change, do you think, in the return assumptions that have won bids in the last couple of years?","James S. Sawyer","I don't think there's been a change in the return assumptions. Certainly, in our projects, we're using the same hurdle rates and return criteria that we used to use. I don't think there's been a change in that. But I think one of the things that's happened is that the construction period for these projects is getting drawn out. And so 10 years ago, we would have said that the duration from signing a contract to startup might be 2 to 3 years. Now, I think on these big refinery projects and big grassroots projects for gasification and so forth, these projects just take longer to build. And so what you're seeing is that we, and I suspect our other industrial gas companies, have got more construction in progress on our books for a longer time before we start getting revenue.","Operator","And your next question is from Laurence Alexander, Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to follow-up on the phrase about being in the late stage of the CapEx cycle. It's been a very long time since the industrial gas industry has seen any sort of a harvest cycle. Can you talk a little bit about how you think EPS, earnings growth and free cash flow conversion would shift if you had an extended period of a falling CapEx backlog?","James S. Sawyer","Well, my guess is that the next 10 years, globally, is just going to be a lower growth time period than the past 10 years. And that particularly will apply to construction and materials. I do not believe that China will ever get back to the amount of construction it had before, and demand in U.S. and Europe is pretty flat. And to a large extent, the Latin American economies have, I think, moved out of the emerging country into the mature country in terms of growth rates. So I think it's been a slow decade for everybody, and we are still building out the projects that were begun in the past couple of years. We do continue to see a lot of activity in project bidding. We have not seen a decline in the activity in project bidding, but I'm guessing that a lot of these projects in China, a lot of these projects in the Gulf Coast that we're bidding on won't take a long time before the customers finally really decide to go forward with them. That's just my personal opinion. So I'm expecting our capital spending will probably go down. I think 2013 was a peak year for us in capital spending. We'll probably be closer to $1.8 billion to $2 billion this year and maybe around there for the remaining period. So I think that means that, well, in 2013, we didn't generate a lot of free cash flow. We're certainly expecting to generate a lot more free cash flow in 2013 and 2014.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then as you look at sort of your priorities for uses of cash, if you do have an extended period of higher free cash flow generation, will there be any differences from how you went through sort of the late '90s period?","James S. Sawyer","I don't want to be confused by talk about the late '90s period.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Skip that part, just as you think looking forward?","James S. Sawyer","Tell you what we would -- we're going to stay in the industrial gases space. And there are 3 golden rules about industrial gases in my opinion, and that is cylinder rental, merchant contracts and on-site contracts. And then the key to getting high return on capital and decent growth at the same time is focusing on density, where you can deliver product to customers with less capital investment and less operating cost than your competitors can. So everything we do is going to be like that. Now, if the opportunities for new on-site projects decline and dry up, then we're just going to be distributing more money to our shareholders.","Operator","And your next question comes from David Begleiter, Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Jim, just on your backlog, given the number of project starting up over the next few quarters, should your backlog by year-end be down from current levels or be flattish?","James S. Sawyer","Well, it's going to be lumpy going forward. And that will depend on the projects that we sign, it will also depend on the timing of the projects because, I said, the negotiations on these projects seem to go on forever these days before a customer makes a final decision. And so we are seeing what I would call a stretch out in when we think we're going to sign the project. But we do think that they are out there. We'll probably end up with a backlog somewhere between $2.0 billion and $2.5 billion kind of on a continuous basis. But it will be lumpy, it may be higher than that or lower than that at certain periods of time.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just on the 3 hydrogen startups, should they all be from day 1, fully loaded? And what will the impact for them will be this year and next year as well?","James S. Sawyer","Yes, so we have basically 4 items in startups this year. And that's a lot of the capital investment that we've got on our books right now that hasn't started up. That will technically come out of the backlog when we start them up, which will lower the backlog, and there aren't going to be substantial contributors to both sales and operating profit as they do. I can't -- I'm not going to give you a specific number on each project though.","Operator","And your next question is from Mike Harrison, First Analysis.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Jim, I was hoping that maybe you could walk through a little bit what you're seeing in terms of Lox\/Lin supply and demand dynamics in Europe and Asia. Are you guys seeing any increased price competition for new accounts in Lox\/Lin in those geographies?","James S. Sawyer","Well, let me talk about Europe first. And I can tell you that our Lox\/Lin capacity utilization is in the low 60s now in Europe. It's been going down quarter-by-quarter. And I suspect that the other players in Europe are similar just because there's been so much negative industrial production going on. So there is clearly more capacity in Europe for Lox\/Lin than there is demand. Now, we have been focusing on pricing like we do everywhere else in the world. And you'll see that our pricing's up about 1% in Europe, but up about 3% in North America. And that primarily -- I think if Europe was a tighter supply\/demand balance, we'd be looking at pricing up 3% there. I forgot -- so Asia, well, I would talk about China. At this point in time, there's probably excess Lox\/Lin in China as well. But that depends on the specific region that you're in. And it's really the argon supply and demand which is getting priced from a commodity base. But we're holding price and increasing prices in Lox\/Lin. Argon, I think, will come back, but the demand for argon sort of significantly decline when the photovoltaic industry declines.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","All right. And I was hoping also to get a little bit more color on what you're seeing on the oilfield side. It sounds like that's a pretty significant headwind right now, but how do you expect that to play out as the year progresses?","James S. Sawyer","That's hard to say. But what we're seeing right now, it is a mix, okay? And we are seeing definitely, in the United States, onshore, less drilling going on and lower volumes of frac-ing gas that we sell and pumping that we do. That definitely was down in the fourth quarter and continues to be down in the first quarter. I don't know. I think that will come back when the price of natural gas comes up a little bit. Even though -- and so all the frac-ing and oil services demand we have right now is in oil or in wet natural gas. Up in Canada, it's low as well. Mexico, on the other hand, is very strong for us because PEMEX is really working hard to get more oil out of the ground.","Operator","And your next question is Mike Sison, KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Jim, when I take a look at North America volumes, it's been quite a long time, really '09 since you had 2 quarters in a row with negative volumes. I know you have some projects coming on stream and for the rest of the year, but how do you see sort of the base business there playing out this year, and when could you potentially see an inflection point?","James S. Sawyer","Well, the weak spot on North America volumes is primarily the frac-ing business that I was just talking about, because that cycles up and down and that has a meaningful impact on the volume number. So the frac-ing is down. Canadian volumes are down because negative industrial production in Canada. Other volumes to other industries are up. But unfortunately, what's going on not only in North America, but globally, is that we're starting up new projects and adding volume with those, but in certain areas, we've got recessions going on and volumes are negative, offsetting the positive volumes from project startups.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then it looks like you did a small tuck-in there for NuCO2, and I know you just closed the business. Do you feel better about what you've seen thus far? And when you think about this business longer term, run rate of 2 50 in terms of sales, is it something you can double over a short period of time?","James S. Sawyer","I wouldn't say double it over a short period of time. But we would expect to get high single digit growth in the business for probably the next 10 years. So that may be a 50% or 75% increase or something of that order. But doubling is probably about the limit. We're very happy with how the business is performing. We're now in there operating the business. We've integrated their financial reporting systems. We're beginning to integrate operationally, and it's a very well-run company.","Operator","And your next question is from Edward Yang, Oppenheimer.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Could you provide some additional color in terms of the margin decline you saw in North America?","James S. Sawyer","Yes. It's kind of a small number. But the 2 contributors to the margin decline, or really 3, and each of them being quite small, is the packaged gas acquisitions that we made. They added more sales but at lower operating margin percentages because packaged gas generally runs in the mid teens operating margin. Secondly, natural gas prices are up, which means that the pass-through effect is up. You see it's up 1%, I think, in the chart. And that expands sales without expanding operating profit, so there's a little bit of impact there. And then thirdly, the lower volumes to oil well services and frac-ing, those are very high margin sales. But I think we're running a strong business and close to the 25% operating margin I'm not complaining about.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And a lot of downbeat comments about Europe, obviously. But in your slides, you referenced improving volumes in Germany, and I was curious what was driving that.","Kelcey E. Hoyt","The lift in Germany sequentially?","James S. Sawyer","No, I can't speak to that. You know what that is?","Kelcey E. Hoyt","I mean just generally, it's a pickup. Some of it's holiday, some of it's with China lifting a little bit, they get the benefit of that. It's modest, but it is somewhat of a pickup.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And Kelcey, one of your competitors talked about European weakness spreading to central and northern countries. Are you seeing any indication of that?","James S. Sawyer","Yes, I mean it is. It's generally, France is not looking too good right now and Germany has got -- had negative growth for the year also. We landed some new accounts and started up some new projects and so forth. But the German economy was just chugging along nicely, while Spain and Italy were suffering. And I think the German exports are down because they export machinery and demand for machinery and power units and so forth is off.","Operator","And your next question comes from David Manthey, Robert W. Baird.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I'm interested in the effective selling days here, this quarter's. I believe you said 2% drag. I'm not sure if that was just Europe or if that was companywide in terms of the revenue drag for the fewer selling days year-over-year. That's number one. And then number two, could you discuss, is there a corresponding benefit next quarter particularly because of Easter?","James S. Sawyer","Yes. Basically, everybody had the 29th of February, whatever country you're in. And that's an extra selling day, plus the way the New Year's holiday fell in the middle of the week. That shortened the first week in January, plus we had Easter at the very, very end of March. So that was a compression in selling days. And when we roll forward to the second quarter, I think we'll be up probably 2% or 3% sequentially.","Operator","And your next question comes from John McNulty Credit Suisse.","Ernie Ortiz","This is actually Ernie Ortiz filling in for John. Just following up on NuCO2, are you still comfortable with the $15 million to $20 million in synergies for next year? And now that you've closed on it, do you think they're going to be a little bit hard to get, a little bit easier to get?","James S. Sawyer","Could you repeat the question?","Kelcey E. Hoyt","Synergies on NuCO2, what are we expecting? Are we still expecting the $20 million? How's it going?","James S. Sawyer","Yes, I mean we're expecting to get to $20 million but probably after about 2 years. And as I said, we've integrated the IT systems and so forth. But the greater synergies will come from several factors, the first one being distribution synergies, with our bulk and packaged gas businesses in the U.S. And then the second one will be coming from the sourcing of the CO2 from our plants rather than from competitors' plants. And then the third one will be to the extent that we can take that business model and operate it in some other countries that we're not operating right now.","Ernie Ortiz","Okay. And then you've also given out the end market trends like, say, energy and metal's up 4%, 6% this quarter. Do you see a lot of the end markets changing as we move into the next quarter?","James S. Sawyer","In metals?","Ernie Ortiz","No, just overall. What kind of end markets do you see changing a lot or [indiscernible].","James S. Sawyer","I don't see them changing, moving into the next quarter. But I will say that when we show those percentages in end markets, sometimes, they are distorted by several onetime events like, for example, we have a lot of turnarounds in refinery and chemical in the first quarter of this year. We won't have that in the second quarter. So -- but I don't see underlying demand really changing.","Operator","We'll move to the next question, which is from Mark Gulley, BGC Finance.","Mark R. Gulley - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Just a question on operating rates [indiscernible] in Europe. If operating rates are in the low [indiscernible]","Kelcey E. Hoyt","Mark, can you repeat that? We can't hear you.","Mark R. Gulley - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Yes. Addressing operating rates in Europe, the low 60s, it would take years and years to -- for those operating rates to get to those satisfactory levels. Therefore, do you see a round of restructuring and plant closures so that capacity really reflects end-use demand?","James S. Sawyer","Well, as we mentioned over the past year, we are doing plant closures and restructurings of packaged gas facilities. So we're reducing the number of packaged gas facilities and redirecting the source of gases to fewer plants to get better operating margin out of that. But I don't see any ASUs or cryogenic plants being restructured.","Mark R. Gulley - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Jim, I was referring to merchant in my question.","James S. Sawyer","Right. Well, the merchant is all made by ASUs, so I don't see that being restructured.","Mark R. Gulley - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then switching to on-site, 2 new developments here recently on the on-site side that I thought were intriguing. One was the substitution of natural gas for coal in fuel-making, which requires more oxygen consumption. The other one you mentioned was that brand new plant you announced with respect to, I'll call it, pet coke gasification to make hydrogen in Alberta. Are those 2 applications, are those 2 new developments big enough to kind of move the needle in terms of more tonnage volumes perhaps from your existing base in the U.S.?","James S. Sawyer","Yes. So let me start with the steel. What steel guys are doing is they're using natural gas as a source of carbon and less coke and coal. When they do that, they need more oxygen per ton of steel produced, okay? And so we're operating pretty close to 90% capacity utilization in oxygen to steel mills even though the steel mills are not operating at their peak capacity. So if the steel mills were to operate at higher capacity, we would probably be building some more air separation plants for steel. But we're not there yet. The second one was in...","Kelcey E. Hoyt","The gasification for Alberta.","James S. Sawyer","Oh, Alberta, yes. That's a very interesting project. And this is one that's similar to the theme I mentioned before, I think we've been talking about this project for 5 or 6 years internally. But essentially, the Alberta government takes royalties from the tar sands producers. And they take the royalties in the form of bitumen rather than in cash. And so the Alberta government is sponsoring a project to gasify that bitumen and to making other liquid fuels with it. So we have a contract with them to supply the oxygen to the gasifier.","Operator","Your next question is from Don Carson, Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Jim, just a question on U.S. merchant. Just wondering what your Lin\/Lox operating rates are currently and how you see some of that operating leverage unfolding. And what impact will these new ASUs have on your operating rates? And then if you could just comment on what's going on in argon and helium as well?","James S. Sawyer","Right. Lin\/Lox operating rates are in the high 70s.","Kelcey E. Hoyt","Sorry, high 80s.","James S. Sawyer","And we don't -- that's kind of -- it's okay, but it's not great. And in terms of helium, we are pretty much evenly matched in terms of our production and sales. Other competitors are still -- have customers on allocation. But over time, more helium will be produced around the world. But it takes time to -- for those projects to get developed. And for the most part, those projects are taking helium off of natural gas streams that are rich in helium. And so they operate subject to the operation of the natural gas field.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","So helium had no negative effect on your merchant volumes then in Q1?","James S. Sawyer","No.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then can you talk a bit about operating leverage as you bring these new plants on and as you get a little more base volume growth in the North American business?","James S. Sawyer","Okay. Well, most of what we're bringing on in North America is hydrogen, hydrogen for refining. And note that when we -- in all 3 of those projects, we are buying a natural gas feedstock and pricing the hydrogen inclusive of what we paid for the natural gas feedstock. Consequently, when they come on, you'll see a very nice sales lift and some compression in operating margin percentage, because that's just -- because we're passing on the natural gas cost in the form of sales.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","No. I was referring to -- you mentioned you were bringing on some ASUs in the back half of the year as well.","James S. Sawyer","Yes. They are -- they'll start up. They should be -- typically ASUs are 30% to 40%, 45% operating margin percentage, so they'll be there.","Kelcey E. Hoyt","Well, they're midsized. They're not as large as the hydrogen.","Okay. So thank you for participating in our first quarter earnings call and especially your patience during the technical difficulties.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Juan Pelaez, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Juan Pelaez","Thanks, Skyler. Good morning, and thank you for attending our third quarter earnings call and webcast. I am joined this morning by Steve Angel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Matt White, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Kelcey Hoyt, Vice President and Controller.","Today's presentation materials are available on our website at praxair.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference. In addition, please note that year-over-year and sequential comparisons excludes merger-related and other costs. The reconciliations to the U.S. GAAP reported numbers are in the appendix to this presentation and the press release.","Let me turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Angel","Thanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone. By all accounts, our third quarter performance was quite strong. Both sales and operating profit grew 8% over prior year, and we delivered record free cash flow, all while operating safely and reliably. Furthermore, we achieved these results despite significant challenges from 3 hurricanes and the Mexican earthquakes. Thankfully, all of our employees are safe and accounted for. In fact, they performed very admirably during these extremely difficult situations.","Despite many of our employees having damage to their own personal property, they continued to support delivery of critical gases for those who are most in need. We are taking actions to help our employees and customers get back to a normal routine, but until then, I'd like to personally extend my appreciation for the entire Praxair team's hard work and dedication.","For the call today, I will walk through some of the key trends we are seeing around the world and provide a brief update on the proposed business combination with Linde. Matt will then walk through the numbers and guidance in more detail, after which we can take your questions.","I'll start with Slide 4, which provides key global trends by operating segment. As you know, North America is our largest segment at 52% of sales. Sales are up 6%, driven by strong volume and pricing across every end market we served. Volume strength in metals and electronics led the way with healthy production rates from our customers, while the resilient markets of food, beverage and health care continued growing mid-single digits. While we saw softer metals volumes at the start of the quarter, those trends reversed by late July. Key startups in chemicals and downstream energy also helped lift volumes as we are enjoying returns of the startups of prior backlog investment in Canada and the U.S. All three supply modes of on-site, merchant and packaged grew, with the most noticeable recovery occurring in our U.S. packaged business that has lapped some of the more difficult comps and is now growing mid-single digits for both gases and hardgoods. This growth was partially offset by the hurricane effects, as Harvey temporarily disrupted our customers in Texas and Maria has significantly impacted our market in Puerto Rico. Overall, we lost approximately $0.02 of EPS this quarter from Harvey. And though Harvey is largely behind us, we expect an additional negative $0.02 effect from Maria in Q4 due to the damaged infrastructure in Puerto Rico.","South America continues to be the most challenging region, now representing only 13% of total sales and becoming less and less of a factor in our overall results. The industrial market has been stabilizing, but at very weak levels as the political uncertainty continues to prevent any meaningful investments. And the lower inflation, while good for the economy in the longer run, has reduced our pricing opportunities. So we are facing a low-growth, low-pricing environment, and I don't expect much change until there is more clarity around the 2018 presidential election. Until then, our team is focusing on cost management, cash generation and growing in the more resilient markets.","Our European segment continues to grow in the mid-single digits due to a combination of strength in consumer markets, coupled with steady recovery in the industrial markets. Metals and manufacturing end markets comprise almost half of the growth as we continue to see higher operating rates across all customers. 1\/4 of the growth relates to food and beverage as the CO2 acquisition has been fully integrated and is contributing as expected, though we did have a shutdown this quarter that temporarily affected our Q3 results.","Our oil well services business in the North Sea and Scandinavia continues to be a challenge, and Russia has not produced as expected given the macro headwinds there. But having said that, Continental Europe continues to improve at a steady pace. Asia at 16% of sales has been the fastest-growing region. In fact, one year ago, Asia represented only 14% of sales. Volumes are up 13% with a little less than half coming from project startups in Korea and China. The growth is broad based with every end market contributing, although metals, electronics and chemicals continue to lead the way.","From my perspective, there are two key reasons for the strong underlying growth. First, the significant investment in the electronics industry, coupled with the Chinese initiative of One Belt, One Road, has stimulated investment and production rates for the broad economy. Second, and probably more importantly, we're starting to see consolidation in certain overcapacity markets in China, which has shifted volume to the most competitive, low-cost producers that we supply. This reduction in capacity has also decreased some of the excess by-product merchant liquid in the market, reducing some of the structural oversupply and supporting price improvements.","In addition to the base business growth, we are seeing more backlog project opportunities, especially for the electronic end market -- electronic and end market across Korea and China. We added 3 new Asian electronics projects to the backlog this quarter and expect to win more over the next year.","Based on the performance around the world, it is clear that our employees have maintained focus on executing our core strategy. However, we have also made significant progress towards the business combination with Linde.","Slide 5 provides a progress update and overview of key milestones for the merger. As stated in prior calls, our priority right now is to obtain all necessary approvals from both shareholders and applicable regulators. I'm happy to report that we had a successful outcome with Praxair shareholders. 83% of all outstanding shares voted in favor of the merger, well above the required majority of 50%. Of the total votes cast, 99% of shareholders voted in favor of the merger, so that speaks to the overall strong level of support.","Currently, we are in an extension period for the Linde exchange offer process. On Monday of this week, both companies mutually agreed to lower the required threshold from 75% to 60%, which extends the tender window for 2 additional weeks. This is a fairly normal occurrence as there are inherent challenges for index funds to tender under this process, and a lower threshold allows them a clear path to tender without concerns of tracking error. As of Tuesday of this week, the percentage of total tendered shares was approximately 65%. We still have confidence in our ability to exceed the initial threshold of 75% over the next few weeks. But we ask those who have not tendered to do so early to help make the process more efficient. In parallel to the shareholder process, we are diligently working with approximately 2 dozen antitrust regulators around the world.","In summary, we are on track to our plan. As expected, we are in different stages with different regulators, and there are significant information requests that are being complied with around the world. We have confidence in our team and advisers given their experience and knowledge, but the process, as expected, will take time. We should have more clarity as we enter the new year, and we'll provide public updates when appropriate. The potential divestiture process will move in lockstep with our efforts to get antitrust approval. There isn't much to update at this time, other than we fully intend to have a structured process, and it will likely kick off late this year into early next year. There is a wide spectrum of interested buyers, and we plan to formally engage with them in the coming months.","So to recap, we are on track on the shareholder approval process, but we ask that any shareholder who has not tendered to consider tendering as soon as possible. Following a successful tender, we anticipate communication to prospective buyers of assets by the end of this year or early 2018 and more clarity around regulatory approval going into the first quarter of next year.","I'd now like to hand it over to Matt to discuss the numbers and guidance.","Matt White","Thanks, Steve. Slide 7 provides further detail on our third quarter results. Sales of $2.9 billion are 8% higher than prior year and 3% higher than the second quarter. Year-over-year sales increased 6% when excluding positive effects of currency and cost pass-through. Volume growth of 5% was driven by approximately 1\/3 from projects and 2\/3 from organic growth, while the 1% price improvement was broad based, with the largest impact from Asia. Project contribution was primarily in North America and Asia, serving the chemical, electronic and energy end markets.","We anticipate further project contribution in the fourth quarter as we have additional startups scheduled. Organic volume growth was balanced across all end markets, as shown on Slide 17 in the appendix. Most markets are growing mid-single digit with a solid recovery in the more industry-related sectors of manufacturing and metals.","Sequentially, sales grew 3%, driven by 2% positive currency and 1% volume. Volume grew from a combination of projects and base business, with seasonal improvements in the Americas and higher industrial activity in Asia.","As Steve mentioned, we did have some negative effect to our results from the hurricanes. Third quarter total revenue was reduced by approximately 50 basis points and EPS by $0.02, primarily from the lower customer operating rates in Texas due to Hurricane Harvey. That impact has substantially subsided, and we do not anticipate any material impact from Harvey going forward.","However, at the end of the third quarter, Hurricane Maria had a significant impact to Puerto Rico. And while it wasn't much of an impact to us in the third quarter, we expect the full impact in the fourth quarter. There's only minor impact to our assets, but the power infrastructure was severely damaged, so we expect it could take some time for recovery. Puerto Rico only represents about 0.5% of global sales, but we are losing variable margin in the situation and are required to incur extraordinary expenses to supply the more critical customers. We do have insurance covering our business losses, which will be settled in a future date. But until then, we've included another $0.02 negative EPS impact in our fourth quarter guidance.","Operating profit of $642 million was 8% higher than prior year and 4% higher sequentially. Operating margin at 22% is consistent with prior year, but this variance is negatively affected by about 20 basis points due to higher cost pass-through, mostly from higher natural gas pricing. Excluding the pass-through effect, positive margin contributions from volume and price actions were partially offset by lower margins in South America and negative mix effects from lower helium and lost hurricane volumes.","The operating profit rolls down to an EPS of $1.50, which includes the $0.02 hurt related to the hurricanes, but excludes $0.05 or $16 million of expenses primarily related to merger costs. Year-over-year EPS growth is slightly lower than the operating profit growth due to higher non-controlling interest expense, primarily related to the PST joint venture, which we will lap by the end of this year. After-tax return on capital has increased to 12.3%, driven by the business growth on a fairly stable capital base.","We signed four new projects that were added to the backlog this quarter, resulting in an increase from $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion of projects under construction, supported by an executed contract with secured revenue. Examples of recently announced projects include: providing high-purity gases to Huali Microelectronics for their new production base near Shanghai; gaseous nitrogen to GLOBALFOUNDRIES for their fabrication facility in upstate New York; and nitrogen to Samsung's display-manufacturing complex in South Korea.","As Steve mentioned, we're confident in our ability to sign additional contracts in the coming months, especially in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Asia. Cash generation was once again quite strong. In fact, free cash flow was the highest quarter on record. You can see that operating cash flow of almost $800 million is higher than both prior year and the second quarter. Our base CapEx is up a little over $20 million, and almost all of that relates to small, non backlog growth capital across our regions, primarily small on-site plants and equipment in support of the merchant liquid growth.","Given our strength in cash flow, I'd like to provide some additional information, which you can find on Slide 8. The graph on the left shows operating cash flow by quarter, represented as green bars. The red line denotes free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less total capital expenditures. You can see that 2017 year-to-date operating cash flow performance is approximately $160 million or 8% better than 2016 year-to-date due to initiatives around managing all aspects of cash flow. Furthermore, our capital spending has decreased over this time, resulting in 24% more free cash flow. The combinations of these efforts has provided us excess cash to deploy, and the pie chart to the right provides a breakdown of the third quarter allocation.","As you know, stock repurchases have been paused during the proposed merger. So the $474 million of free cash flow this quarter was roughly split between dividends and net debt reduction. We anticipate further reductions in net debt over the next several quarters due to the continued strong cash flow generation.","I'd like to wrap up with guidance, which you can find on Slide 9. Fourth quarter guidance is estimated to be between $1.45 and $1.50. As mentioned earlier, this range includes a $0.02 headwind from the effects of lost variable margin and excessive dislocation costs in Puerto Rico, as we anticipate it will take considerable time to fully restore power. The midpoint of this range is a few cents lower than the $1.50 we just achieved in the third quarter. We often experience seasonal declines from Q3 to Q4 due to lower CO2 demand in North America and lower general industrial activity in South America from the summer break and Christmas holiday. We expect the South American trend to be worse than historical as customers often take extended outages during weak demand periods, similar to what happened last year.","Furthermore, we are not expecting any sequential relief from the hurricane impact as the elimination of the Q3 negative Harvey impact is offset by the Q4 impact to Puerto Rico. Foreign currency rates have also softened in recent weeks, which may have a small negative sequential impact. But overall, we feel good about the demand patterns heading into the fourth quarter, but we remain cautious on South America.","The updated fourth quarter guidance results in a new full year guidance range of $5.78 to $5.83. The midpoint of this range is approximately $0.12 or 2% higher than our prior range. A combination of higher volume and price trends in Asia, better North American metals production and improved currency rates from the prior guidance have all led to better results in Q3 and an improved outlook for Q4.","I'll now turn the call over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews","Encouraging to hear that the packaged and hardgoods businesses is picking up and that those trends seem to be more complementary in terms of what the go-forward growth outlook is from an implications perspective. But what are you seeing sequentially that's driving that? And where do you think we are in this recovery?","Steve Angel","Well, Vince, I would say that much of what we see in packaged gases is tied to industrial production, and it's also tied to, more specifically, metal fabrication. In fact, about half of our sales of our packaged gas business are tied to that specific market. But if I look at the drivers of that business, of metal fabrication, for example, capital equipment seems to be stronger and getting stronger. You've heard some reports from some major capital equipment producers that has been more positive than what we've heard in the past. Transportation seems to be fairly strong in the United States. So that seems to be what's behind it. I anticipate that, that trend should continue. I'm not hearing anyone say or think that, that might not be the case. Automotive is a piece of that. Obviously, we supply products into that supply chain. And that seems to be holding up fairly well, though the results seem to be mixed and impacted by hurricanes and so forth. But that's how I'd answer that question. It looks like it's got some legs heading into 2018.","Vincent Andrews","And then maybe just a follow-up on South America. Obviously, ongoing issues there, but do you think we're near the bottom, at least in terms of your results vis-\u00e0-vis maybe some of the self-help measures you're putting in there? So as we look into '18, we should at least see a flattening out? Or how should we be thinking about that?","Steve Angel","Good question. I think Q4, as Matt described, from the standpoint of you got the normal seasonal effects, it's their summertime, it's the holidays, and you have weak economic activity. So I'm not really expecting much positive to come out of Q4. A lot of what's taking place there seems to be influenced by the political environment. I guess the bit of good news that we heard recently, and it's hard to believe we would ever characterize this as good news, is that Temer is not going to be charged with corruption. So that's a positive. The Selic lending rate was lowered another 75 basis points, so that's positive in terms of stimulating some activity. From our standpoint, we've worked hard on the cost side. We've worked hard on building out the resilient end markets. The team works extremely hard on cash flow because that's, obviously, very important, particularly in a difficult environment, and they're doing a great job with that. We have some other things we're looking at that we think are going to provide positive effects. I would say it's stable. I'm not expecting anything really positive to come out of Q4 for the reasons I just mentioned. I don't think it's going to get any worse in 2018, and I would say -- and of course, we have elections that are a year away, which will be very interesting to see how that all -- all that plays out. But again, I would say we're probably bouncing along the bottom here. We are very well positioned to capitalize on any improvement. It will come at some point. It's hard for me to predict when.","Operator","Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander","Couple of quick questions. First, given the -- what you're seeing in terms of bidding activity picking up, do you think CapEx should be higher or just flat in 2018? And secondly, with the fairly wide discount that Linde is at currently, once the vote has -- if the tender completes favorably, what's the -- how is the price set for -- if there's going to be an effort to buy out those stub shares? And when would be the first time that you can set -- you can approach that?","Steve Angel","Well, let me just take the first question. Based on the positive activity that we're seeing, we've talked a lot about U.S. Gulf Coast in prior quarters. We're having a lot of success there, and we think we'll have a lot of success going forward. And you can add to that a lot of activity on the electronics side, driven more by data, the use of data, more memory storage, the cloud, Internet of Things, however you want to characterize it. There's a lot of demand driving a lot of chip production. And then also on the display side. We're seeing a lot of activity around OLED, AMOLED production, and we're well positioned to take advantage of that. So -- but having said all that, my anticipation going forward, Laurence, is that the CapEx spend rate is going to be about where it is this year. I'm looking at something around $1.4 billion, perhaps $1.5 billion. That'll depend on when we're able to win projects and start spending against those projects. But I think that's a very healthy pace, and that will continue. What we've been saying is that we expect about 3% per year earnings per share contribution out of our large projects as they start up going forward. So that's how I'd answer your first question. On your second question, clearly, the difference in our market capital has been closing as there's been more and more confidence in shareholder approval, perhaps more confidence in the regulatory approval process and then the divestiture process and just the overall likelihood that the deal will consummate. So that's what we expected to see, that the market capitalization would close based on the ratios that are used between Linde shares and Praxair shares. As far as the stub, I'm going to ask Matt just to comment on that.","Matt White","Yes, Laurence. This is Matt. I think it's just a bit too early to talk about that at this stage. I mean, as Steve mentioned in the prepared remarks, our focus right now is over the next few weeks to achieve our threshold. We feel quite confident about that, and that's the focus. When that ends, any relevant communication on the next phases will be given at that time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Mike Sison","Question on Asia pricing turn. It was positive again. When you think about where your products are priced there relative to other regions, is there a long potential tail for pricing in the region for the next couple of years?","Steve Angel","That's a very important question. There's no secret that the lowest pricing we've had in the merchant liquid space has been in China for some years. That comment probably applies to a lot of other industries as well. So yes, there is opportunity, clearly, to improve the pricing environment in China. The interesting thing is there has been inflation over recent years. And we, as an industry, have not been able to keep up with that inflation. It is very low pricing, as I said, to begin with, which really changed. And I alluded to that in my comments, is that we've seen -- as we've seen some of our -- metals capacity come offline, 150 million tons, for example, of the steel industry, that removes the by-product liquids that were also produced. So that has been favorable, particularly on the argon side of the equation. I would say that the industry -- the industrial gas industry has not added capacity at the pace it had in prior years. So I think that was helpful in allowing demand to grow into the current supply capacity. And then what we've been working on, really, for several years now, and I think it's really starting to come to fruition is, is shifting more and more of our sales to direct end users. And much of that sale is wrapped around an application. So it's stickier, typically higher-priced. Today, we're probably close to 85% of our sales are direct to the end user versus distributor.","Mike Sison","Great. And then quick follow-up. You've had more time to think about the Linde opportunities and potential. Anything new in terms of longer-term potential for the combination, anything new and exciting?","Steve Angel","It's been exciting from the beginning. So I would say it was kind of hard to top what we've seen as the potential from the beginning. So the interesting thing about where we are in this process is that we have, obviously, worked towards shareholder approval. We worked collaboratively towards regulatory approvals, and we'll work collaboratively as we start looking at divestitures and who they may go to. And we can work on integration planning, and we have been doing that. But beyond that, there's not a lot more we can do at this stage. Obviously, as we get more into the new year, have a chance to really start looking at the synergies at a more detailed level, I expect we'll find more. And if you go back and just take a look at what we said when we introduced this deal, we said there's a $1 billion of cost synergies. We felt comfortable with that. There's a couple hundred million dollars of CapEx, and we said -- and plus growth synergies. And we know the growth synergies are there. But again, at this stage, we haven't spent a lot of time evaluating that yet. But I think we'll find more as we grow -- as we get closer to the expected close in the second half of next year. What we always have to remind ourselves here and remind our friends at Linde is that we're still competitors, and we have to be viewed as such in the marketplace.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeff Zekauskas","Can you, at least in very rough terms, frame the index fund voting issue, having to do with the transaction? That is, in rough terms, what do you see as index ownership of Linde and what percentage do you think has voted? Or what's the percentage that you think that you're going to capture through this extension?","Steve Angel","Well, that index fund ownership, we estimate at around 14% to 15%. And when we lower the threshold, that was -- one of our objectives was to remove a condition that would have prevented them from recommending to their -- for the indexes recommending to their shareholders to vote in favor of the transaction. So again, it's about 14% to 15%. DAX came out a couple of weeks ago, I believe, and said that they were going to change their tracking stock to the new Linde plc, and they announced the date, I think, it was October 25. Recently, MSCI and FTSE have come out and have said that essentially, if at the end of this tender period, which is November 7, provided the 60% threshold is met, and as of Tuesday, we were at 65%, so that seems to be a good assumption, that they would be changing their tracking stock to the new class of shares. And at that point, the holders of those index -- those funds would naturally tender their shares.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay. And can you talk about what's going right and what's going wrong in your South American operations in that year-over-year, your revenues grew, but your operating profits fell from $68 million to $63 million?","Steve Angel","So I think what's going right, you can see, is the growth has been held in there pretty well. Now keep in mind, a lot of that growth is coming from food and beverage and the health care industry. The health care growth is good growth, but it doesn't carry the margins that our core manufacturing business would carry. And if you go back and look a couple of years ago, you'll see that industrial production was much higher a couple of years ago than it is today. I think we're still off probably a good 30%. That's high-margin business for us. That manufacturing business is very high margin for us. It's our packaged gas business. It's our merchant liquid business. And so you can call that a mix effect, but it's very real. And so until that starts to recover, we're going to have some pressure on the margin side. Now I'll also add to that something that Matt reminds me from time to time, and that is that the good news is we have our metals customers, our steel customers, are paying their take or pays. And that's the good news. But the problem is many of them are still producing underneath their take or pays or below their take or pays. So as their volumes improve, which they are improving, more export-driven, we're going to actually incur more cost until they cross that take-or-pay threshold. So that is also an element of why the margins aren't as strong as they had been historically.","Operator","Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","P.J. Juvekar","A question on health care. You have health care business in Europe. Linde has a much bigger health care business in U.S. through Lincare. So when you combine, you would have a bigger position there in that end market. What are the trends in health care you're seeing? And can you just talk to us about that?","Steve Angel","Well, I think the trends, generally speaking, if you look at -- if you just start with Europe, we would be in -- we have a health care business in Spain, we have a health care business in Italy, primarily. Outside of Europe, Canada, we have a health care business, Mexico, et cetera. And our health care business, if I just segment that one more level, if you look at hospital, it's been quite strong all over the world, always a good business for us. If you look at the home care business, it kind of is dependent. In Europe, the business still looks healthy to us. As far as the trends in the U.S., our hospital business kind of continues to click along at a, I'd say, low single-digit rate, but it's very stable. Our business in Canada, both institutional and home care, does quite well. In Mexico, our home care business is doing fine. As far as their Lincare business, you got to keep in mind, I'm not privy to all that information nor should I be until we get -- until we close between the 2 companies. But because we were in the business and exited sometime around 2010, we are familiar with the business. We have watched the results of some of the auctions, whereby the price of auction done is a good 70% lower than it was, say, back in really the 2010 time frame. So what we have observed Linde do, Lincare do in this environment is to build density. I think that's a smart thing to do. Density is the secret to a lot of our business around the world, so they've been building density. They've been doing some acquisitions. And that's what I've observed from afar. But as far as specifically what's going on, I'm not privy to that information today, but it certainly feels like they're doing all the right things. And I think arguably, and you've heard me say this before, these price reductions that have gone into effect, most people think, or observers in the industry think that we have to be near the end of this process. The small ma-and-pa type of home care suppliers can't stay in business. They can't earn positive cash flow. So I don't think our government really needs to keep pressing on that. And I think we're probably near the end of all that price pressure, which says it could be a good time to be in the U.S. home care business.","P.J. Juvekar","Very interesting. And then a question on India. You've traditionally had a very strong position there, but now your competitor is also building 6 new ASUs through a joint venture there. So I'm just wondering, what is the competitive landscape in India? And you've seen more competition come up there.","Steve Angel","Well, I think one thing -- obviously, as we look at India, the growth prospects look pretty good. Our volumes have been pretty good there. I think there's probably more opportunities to come in the near future. The structure of India is different than China, in that there's not as many competitors in India nor have there been as there are in China because you have all the local producers and so forth. But certainly, there's plenty of competition there. But I think our competitors are seeing what we see, is that India is a land of opportunity going forward. Everybody wants to start to build their positions. What I know for sure is that we have an excellent position today as a stand-alone company in India, and so we feel very good about our ability to capitalize on whatever opportunities come down the road.","P.J. Juvekar","So you don't see sort of the overcapacity you saw in China, that scenario repeat in India?","Steve Angel","Could you repeat that? I didn't quite hear you.","P.J. Juvekar","Yes. So you don't see the overcapacity that we saw in China, that kind of scenario repeat in India?","Steve Angel","I don't see that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick Lambert with Raymond James.","Patrick Lambert","Three questions for me. The first one is could you give a bit more granularity on the 13% growth in Asia around your 3 major countries? There are big differences between the [2]. I would expect electronics in China to be driving pretty well. That's my first question. The second, we got in the backlog the $1.5 billion, could you help us out in terms of you gave the EPS impact, the contribution that was put up. Could you give us the top line or the capital intensity of those projects, especially when you [run] the 2018, '19 type of capital intensity we should use to forecast? And finally, a bit the -- a question about Linde. What happens if you don't get that threshold of 75%? How can you incentivize a bit more the Linde shareholders to tender? Or what can you do to salvage the deal, if you don't get the threshold?","Steve Angel","Well, let me -- I'll just take the last one first. I mean, given where we are as of Tuesday with 65% tendered, and that's without the contributions largely of the index funds, and we said that's 14% to 15%, and provided we get -- today, we're at 65%. The threshold that we had to cross was 60% for this current period. At the end of this period, provided we're still above 60%, which I assume we will be well above that, then there'll be another 2-week period that will be granted. So the long and short of that is we feel pretty confident today about the 75%, though everybody needs to come in and vote to make that a reality. I'll go back to your first question on Asia. And I'm not looking at the breakdown of numbers by country, but I can say that electronics activity in Korea with Samsung is quite strong. Project activity is quite strong. So that would be a big driver of that 13%. But also, in China, we are very well positioned with Tier 1 metals customers, very well positioned with some of the chemical customers that are growing there. Metal fabrication seems to be stronger. Electronics is growing across the board in China, so a lot of growth is coming there. Growth in India has been pretty consistent. A little weaker in Thailand, but that's how I would basically talk about where the growth is coming. I think the 2 strongest countries clearly were China and South Korea for us. Then on the backlog side, the $1.5 billion, I've said 3% EPS contribution going forward. The revenue line might be a little lighter than that, call it 2-ish. And the reason is that just the basic structure of many of our contracts are going to be more facility fee-based, which means less contribution on the revenue, but strong contribution from cash flow that hits the earnings per share.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts","In the Praxair proxy, you showed Linde's packaged gas business as 40% of their sales. That was much higher than I was expecting. It's higher than Praxair, and it's higher than their on-site and merchant bulk business. Do they do anything differently overseas in their packaged gas operations than you do in the U.S.? I'm thinking pull through more hardgoods or have more branded products like Airgas used to have? Or are they pretty similar to you in that packaged gas business they have?","Steve Angel","Well, it's not hardgoods related. It would certainly be more pure gas than what we would have in the U.S., where hardgoods has traditionally been more of the gas package. But if you go back and look at Linde historically, they've always been very strong in the cylinder gas business. I would say they've been a technology leader in the cylinder gas business. And if you look at their positions around the world, I mean, I can just take, for example, Eastern Europe, they're very strong in the packaged gas business in places like Eastern Europe. They're really all over. Everywhere they participate, they've typically been strong. So again, here's an area where, after we close, it'll be really interesting to look at their strengths vis-\u00e0-vis ours, and I think there's going to be plenty of opportunity there.","John Roberts","And then maybe an on-site question. I believe you depreciate the capital over the initial life of an on-site contract. With the step-up depreciation that's going to come as part of the merger here, will any of that be assignable to contract renewals and allow you to expense that a little quicker?","Matt White","John, this is Matt. I can handle that question. As you can imagine, we're using U.S. GAAP acquisition accounting rules. That's what we're required to use because there is no other solution under U.S. GAAP for this. And under that, we have to allocate all of the step-up across various aspects, including tangible assets, nontangible assets as well as goodwill in the nontangible. So there's going to be a variety of different lives. The shortest would be something like COGS, cost of goods sold, as you can imagine, as that works through inventory. And then clearly, the longest would be goodwill with indefinite and other types of intangibles, like brand equity and things like that, which could be substantially long lives. So a lot of this information, actually, you can find in our S-4 filing. It does give some of the step-up assumptions at that time. Realize that number is very preliminary. The real number will not be known until the actual close. But if you go to the S-4, you can probably get a lot more details on what you're looking at.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research.","Matt DeYoe","This is Matt DeYoe on for Kevin. Just to piggyback a bit on a prior question about margins in South Africa -- or sorry, South America. Sounds like top line's stabilizing a bit, but the mix, I guess, is working against you. So what is the traditional margin differential between the shrinking manufacturing businesses and the growing health care businesses? Like, trying to get a sense for how much downside you might have from here despite what sounds like stabilization.","Steve Angel","Well, I don't think you need to calculate downside from here because I think industrial production is actually improving a bit. It's just improving off a very low bottom. But clearly, the margins are much higher because you're talking about argon. You're talking about some packaged gases where we have very strong market positions, very strong merchant liquid sales, et cetera. But if you go back -- if you went back many years and you looked at where South America operating margins were, we were in the low 20s at one time. So I think you can think about it in terms of -- with a strong industrial production economy, we should be able to get back to the 20 kind of range, but we're not close to that type of economy today.","Matt DeYoe","Okay. And then you'd also mentioned that lower inflation in Brazil is making it a little bit harder to get price. And it seems like price has trended back to flat kind of on a year-over-year basis from what seemed like mid-single-digit growth last year. Is it possible prices go negative? Or do you think again we're pretty much bottoming here?","Steve Angel","I think we're pretty much bottoming here. I mean, I don't expect any kind of real turnaround in terms of our ability to pass price through, at least anytime soon. I think to your point, we're probably bottoming.","Matt White","And Matt, just to add one thing. Remember, that price line also includes mix too. So it will have product mix, and that could also have a negative effect on that line.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Sheehan with SunTrust.","Jim Sheehan","Could you give us a sense for merchant operating rates by region and if you've seen any changes since last quarter?","Steve Angel","I think we can do that. I would say if you start with Asia, mid-80s. China looks to be low 90s. So that is somewhat of an improvement from the prior quarter, obviously. If I look at -- U.S. is still very tight on argon supply. That has been where we've been in the past. LOX\/LIN, I would say around 80-ish kind of number, so that really hasn't changed that much. Europe, still in the 70s. And Brazil, as you can imagine, would be in the low to mid-70s.","Jim Sheehan","And with respect to your announcement on the BASF project there, do you have any bigger emphasis on syngas these days than in the past? And how do you view that market as being a strategic fit for you?","Steve Angel","Well, certainly, if I look at the backlog today, that -- we have 2 projects today where we are providing syngas, hydrogen and carbon monoxide. So as the -- we've talked about this in the past. But typically, in the U.S. Gulf Coast, a lot of the demand was driven by hydrogen for refining. Now the demand is more driven by the build-out of the -- of chemical industry. That's ammonia, that's isocyanates, ethylene oxide, acetyls and so forth. And they require more carbon monoxide versus hydrogen in most cases. So we have had more of an emphasis on technology and project execution around those types of plants. That is a shift, but it's a shift that we welcome, and we're having a lot of success. And we expect to have a lot of success going forward.","Operator","Our last question comes from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.","Don Carson","Two questions actually. First, Matt, last quarter, you were quite cautious on the outlook for metals and autos in the U.S. Is your more positive outlook there the key to your guidance improvement? And then secondly, on Linde. Steve, as you talked to the regulators, are you still pretty confident that you won't go through that \u20ac3.7 billion threshold for divestitures?","Steve Angel","Let me take -- I'll take the last one first, and then I'll turn it over to Matt since you posed that question directly to him. So we are in active discussions with some 2 dozen regulators. I would say everything is pretty much on track to where we thought we would be. I haven't heard anything that would give me any pause for concern. They certainly are engaged, and we welcome that engagement. To answer your specific question, I don't think we're going to approach that threshold that was stipulated in the BCA. Just to add a little color to that, that is a threshold that says that either party could opt out of the deal if that sales and EBITDA threshold were crossed. But as I sit here today, I don't think we're going to threaten that threshold.","Matt White","And Don, this is Matt. So yes, to your point, last quarter, when we laid out the guidance, as you may recall, there were kind of 3 areas that we were a bit cautious on as we described, and it was North American metals, it was the high trend of Asian volumes, and then it was the foreign currency rates. And we had said across all 3, we had some assumptions that they got a little worse into the quarter. But had they stayed at the current rates, that would provide upside, as you may recall. And when you look at the guidance range we gave, the midpoint was about $1.43, and we did about $0.07 better. When you look at those numbers, 1\/2 to 2\/3 of it is related to better performance in North America, net of the hurricanes, as well as Asia. So those levels maintained and in some cases, improved off of where we were running at the Q2 time frame. And FX rates, as you know, did improve off the July forward rates. Now our current outlook has the October, sort of first of the month October forward rates. They have weakened a bit here over the last month. So we'll see what that means at the end of the quarter. But those were the main drivers, to your point, that those turned out better than we anticipated and were a big driver of our upside for the third quarter.","Juan Pelaez","Thank you again for participating in our third quarter earnings call.

My name is Ashley, and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Jim Sawyer, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. Please proceed.","James S. Sawyer","Thank you, Ashley, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining today's third quarter conference call. As many of you have seen from this morning's press release, I have decided to retire after 28 years with Praxair and Union Carbide. I'll miss everyone in the Praxair team, as well as the regular flow of conferences and meetings with those of you in the investment community.","It has been a very exciting and rewarding career, especially the formation of Praxair 20 years ago and each step of the way watching our team make us a better and better company, and I'm confident that it will become better yet with the new generation of Praxair leaders and particularly, my successor, Matt White.","Now Steve Angel would like to say a few words and introduce Matt before Kelcey and I review the quarter's results.","Stephen F. Angel","Thank you, Jim. I wanted to take this opportunity to thank Jim for his many years of service and also to introduce Matt to you.","Jim was the CFO when I joined the company in early 2001, and I've had the pleasure of working with Jim as both a business leader within the company and for the last 7 years as CEO. Now if I do the math, Jim, it would say that you've been on more than 50 earnings calls over your tenure.","Now Jim has been an integral part of Praxair's successes, as you all know. And during his tenure as CFO, our net income after tax has quadrupled from about $440 million to $1.7 billion, and market cap has grown from $8 billion to more than $35 billion today.","I will miss Jim's steady hand and sound judgment. Jim, we all hate to see you go but we know all good things must come to an end, and we wish you and your family all the best.","I know you will be around to help with the transition and say goodbye to all your friends and coworkers out there.","Now of course, we've been planning for Jim's succession for some time, just as we do all senior management roles within Praxair. And we believe Matt is well prepared for his new role.","You will note from Matt's resume that he was Controller of our largest and most profitable business, North American Industrial Gases, for a number of years. He also has served as our Global Corporate Controller, and then Global Treasurer before taking on an operational business role running our Canadian business over the last couple of years. Matt has performed exceptionally well in all these assignments and we are confident he will do the same as our next CFO.","And with that, I'll give Matt a chance to say a few words and then we'll move on to the quarterly results and outlook.","Matthew J. White","Thanks, Steve. I've worked closely with Jim during my 9 years here at Praxair. And like everyone else who has worked with him, I respect and admire the strength of his knowledge, as well as his many contributions to Praxair. His approach to running the business for cash flow while maximizing growth and return on capital is one that is instilled throughout our entire organization.","We plan to continue this high level of quality and discipline while returning cash to shareholders through growing dividends and share repurchases.","From an investment community perspective, while I've had an opportunity to meet quite a few of you in my prior roles, I do look forward to meeting more of you in the months and years to come. So congratulations once again, Jim, on your many successful years leading our finance organization and I wish you well in retirement.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Kelcey for her commentary on the quarter.","Kelcey E. Hoyt","Thanks, Matt. Today's presentation materials are available on our website at praxair.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference.","Please also note that our discussion of earnings for the third quarter, including year-over-year and sequential comparisons, excludes the impact of a pension settlement charge taken this quarter, as well as previously disclosed adjustments in the third quarter of 2012. These items are detailed and reconciled to the U.S. GAAP reported numbers in the appendices to this presentation and the press release.","Please turn to Slide 3 for our consolidated third quarter results. Consolidated sales in the third quarter were $3 billion, up 9% versus the prior-year quarter. Similarly, adjusted EPS, excluding the pension settlement charge, was up 9% year-over-year.","Excluding foreign currency, third quarter sales grew 10%, while operating profit grew 11%, continuing to demonstrate operating leverage. Sales growth from higher volumes and higher pricing was 7%, reflecting growth in all geographic segments.","On-site sales in North America and Asia had strong growth, driven by new project start-ups, including refinery hydrogen supply.","South American organic sales reflect higher price and growth from a few end markets, including metals, manufacturing and health care.","European organic growth was driven by price.","Industrial gas acquisitions in North America and Europe contributed 3% to sales growth.","Sequentially, 2% organic growth was driven by double-digit on-site volume growth in North America and Asia. Merchant volumes were steady to modestly higher in most regions except Europe, which included summer vacation seasonality.","Operating profit was $679 million, up 9% as compared to the prior-year quarter from higher volumes, pricing and acquisitions.","The EBITDA and operating margins were strong at 32.1% and 22.5%, respectively.","Net income of $451 million increased 8% from the prior year, slightly less than operating profit due to higher interest expense from increased debt levels to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures, as well as the fact that we have termed out more than 80% of our debt with long-term bonds that carry higher interest rates than commercial paper.","Earnings per share of $1.51 grew 9% over the prior-year quarter, higher than net income growth due to a 1% reduction in the number of diluted shares outstanding as a result of net repurchases of common stock.","During the quarter, we repurchased $81 million of stock, net of issuances. $532 million remains available under the $1.5 billion share repurchase program that we authorized in January of last year.","Our after-tax return on capital this quarter is 12.8%, reflecting CapEx on the balance sheet for plants that have not yet started or are just beginning to ramp up, as well as the acquisition of NuCO2.","Our project backlog, which we define as projects greater than $5 million and associated with a fully executed long-term customer contract is currently at $2 billion and comprised of 35 projects.","During the quarter, we started 3 plants and signed 2 long-term contracts for new projects. About 40% of the capital expenditures in the backlog is in North America, and about 40% in Asia, which includes projects in China, India and Korea. The rest of the backlog resides in Europe, primarily Russia and in South America.","The projects will serve customers in the energy, chemical, manufacturing, electronics and metals markets.","New proposals remain healthy with the largest amount of activity within our operating regions in North America, followed by Asia and Russia.","Now please turn to Page 4 for our results in North America. Sales in North America were $1.6 billion, 14% above the prior-year quarter. Underlying sales growth was 7%, driven primarily by higher on-site volume from new project start-ups for hydrogen supply to refinery customers in the United States and higher pricing.","Growth from acquisitions was 6%, driven by NuCO2 as well as packaged gas distributors.","The effects of cost pass-through, primarily higher natural gas price, which is contractually passed on to hydrogen customers, increased sales by 1% year-over-year.","During the third quarter, we announced the startup of 135 million standard cubic foot per day hydrogen plant in the Mississippi River Corridor, serving Valero Saint Charles refinery and Louisiana under our long-term supply agreement. This plant, along with a similar-sized hydrogen plant that started up in the second quarter in Port Arthur, Texas, contributed significantly to the double-digit year-over-year on-site volume growth.","Merchant sales grew organically 4% year-over-year and 3% sequentially on higher volumes and pricing. In particular, we are seeing strong liquid nitrogen sales to energy customers for our oil well service business in Mexico, as well as frac-ing for natural gas liquids and oil in Canada.","In our U.S. packaged gas business, sales were up 6%, and excluding acquisitions, up 2%, as strong pricing more than offset lower hard goods volumes.","By end market, the U.S. packaged gas business has seen modest growth in chemicals and refining and commercial aerospace, where we are beginning to ramp national supply across multiple locations to a global manufacturer, including their new facility in Charleston.","On the other hand, met fab and heavy machinery remains weak. This is largely a reflection of the fact that nonresidential construction is not growing in the United States, and in fact, government expenditures have fallen over the past 9 months.","North American operating profit was $406 million, 9% above the prior-year quarter due to higher volumes from project start-ups, higher pricing and acquisitions. The operating margin remains strong at 25.6%.","Proposal activity for new on-site plants in North America remains solid in chemicals and metals.","Now please turn to Page 5 for our results in Europe. Sales in Europe were $386 million, 10% above the prior-year quarter. Excluding the effects of lower cost pass-through and the positive effects of currency translation, sales grew 6%, primarily from industrial gas acquisitions.","Overall volumes were comparable to the prior year, as volume growth from project start-ups in Russia was offset by lower base business volumes, primarily packaged gases in Spain and Italy.","Similarly, construction in Spain and Italy has not recovered at all since the recession.","Operating profit of $64 million increased 7% due to higher pricing, acquisitions and currency translation. Cost reductions and productivity benefits outpaced inflation in most markets.","The segment is well-positioned for margin improvement as volumes stabilize in Southern Europe, and we begin to further start up and load the new plants in Russia. The majority of project proposal activity on European segment on the chemical and metals market is within Russia.","Page 6 shows our results in South America. During the quarter, growth in South America continued to move forward at a moderate pace with industrial production expansion in capital goods and construction.","South American segment sales were $494 million, down 4% versus the prior-year quarter. Excluding unfavorable currency translation impacts, sales grew 6% from higher volume, primarily from merchant and packaged gas customers and higher overall pricing.","Sales growth came from most major end markets including metals, manufacturing, chemicals, health care and food and beverage.","We continue to grow merchant and packaged gas sales to customers across South America through our application technologies. One example in the area of food and beverage in South America as food exports are strong industry and improved consumer incomes are driving higher local per capita consumption.","Praxair provides food and beverage manufacturers with freezing, chilling and processing technologies for improved yield, productivity and finished goods quality.","Operating profit in South America was $115 million, up 3% versus the prior year. Excluding currency effects, operating profit in the quarter increased 14%, again demonstrating strong operating leverage from improved volume and continued execution of price.","New on-site project proposals remain active but are more weighted towards small to midsize plants. Projects are located in Brazil and the surrounding countries in South America and are for customers in the metals, energy, pulp and paper and construction markets.","Please turn to Slide 7 for our results in Asia. Sales of $385 million grew 8% versus the prior year quarter. Strong volume growth increased sales by 10% due to higher volumes in China, India and Korea, as well as strong demand from existing customers in the metals and chemicals markets. The growth was driven by new projects -- the growth was driven half by new project growth and half base business growth.","Lower argon pricing in China and electronics packaged gas pricing in Asia reduced sales by 1% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to weaker demand for electronics, including solar.","Asia's operating profit of $67 million increased 29% from the prior year quarter. Strong on-site volume growth and a settlement of a prior-year receivable in China, partially offset by the impact of lower pricing, contributed to the growth in operating profit.","Our results for Surface Technologies are shown on Page 8.","Surface Technologies sales for the quarter were $160 million, up 1% organically versus the prior year, excluding currency. Strength in commercial aviation and industrial coatings was partially offset by weakness in military aviation.","Operating profit increased $2 million or 8% in the third quarter. The impacts of higher pricing and lower costs including benefits of prior year restructure programs, primarily in Europe, more than offset the impact of lower volumes.","And now I'll turn the call back to Jim for a discussion of our outlook and fourth quarter earnings guidance.","James S. Sawyer","Thanks, Kelcey. Please turn to Slide 9. Looking into the fourth quarter, we see that global industrial production growth is a tad slower than we anticipated earlier in the year. Also currency headwinds are a bit higher than we had anticipated.","Consequently, we're setting fourth quarter earnings guidance in the lower half of the range that we had set in July. Fourth quarter EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.52 to $1.57, which, as you can see, is this deep sequential increase from the $1.51 that we earned in the third quarter. That places full year EPS guidance at $5.90 to $5.95. These represent year-over-year growth of 10% to 14% for the fourth quarter and 6% to 7% for the year, as the first and second quarters did not show as much earnings growth as we're seeing now.","In North America, we're expecting all of the growth to come from new projects and productivity efforts. Consequently, we're not expecting much help from the economy. This probably will not change until government spending plans are clarified and small businesses and government contractors' level of business confidence rises to the point where they will make new investment decisions.","Over the longer term, we still think the outlook for U.S. manufacturing and commodity production will be very good due to labor productivity and low energy and feedstock cost.","The pipeline of new projects [indiscernible] remains very strong but the timing is getting stretched out due to the same uncertainty and level of business confidence.","South America seems to be on the mend, particularly in Brazil, but industrial activity remains spotty with some industries accelerating nicely, but others still looking for direction. We expect the currency to stay around BRL 2.2 to the dollar, which we think is a good equilibrium which allows exports, including steel, to be profitable. But having said that, we all know the BRL is one of the most volatile currencies in the world due to the risk on, risk off nature of fast money.","Asia is doing well in all of the countries we participate, India, Korea, Thailand and China. The rate of new projects activity remains strong in all countries and end markets.","Europe seems to be on the mend as well, and as we've said earlier, we're well-poised to deliver significant operating leverage when the underlying demand for package and merchant gases begins to grow.","We are very excited about what we're doing in Russia, where there are many new project opportunities.","Now just a final word on cash flow and return on capital. Return on capital is lower than we would like it to be as a result of goodwill associated with the NuCO2 acquisition. The large amount of new projects which are under construction and other projects which have started up but not yet ramped up on the merchant byproducts partially due to the stagnant global economy.","This means overall capacity utilization has lots of room to grow and we expect to see that over the next 5 years. Accordingly as we said before, we're leaving the era of peak capital spending. As operating cash flow continues to grow strongly, while capital spending levels off, we'll be generating increasing free cash flow, which, as always, we will distribute to you, our shareholders.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Q&A and Steve and I will answer your questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of James Sheehan with SunTrust.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Jim, I just want to ask a question about Europe. Do you have -- do you see any concrete signs that -- of recovery in Europe or any signs of a tick up, any -- how confident are you that the situation in Europe has bottomed?","James S. Sawyer","Well, I guess, my opinion is that part of the reason for the slowdown in Europe, on top of the private sector slowing down in the great recession, was the governments in Italy and Spain and Portugal and Ireland and now France, have to reduce their budgets and spending. And as a result of that, one of the things they cut was discretionary spending and that would include construction spending. And a lot our packaged gas and our merchant products go into either construction spending or machinery and so forth that goes into those projects. So I think that, now, most of those countries have stopped reducing their budgets and will start increasing spending. So what we've seen is basically a leveling off, no longer going down in volumes there. And it's hard to predict what will go on in Europe but I see either stabilizing here or getting better.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And also, on EPS guidance, you mentioned some of the change was due to impacts from FX. How much of the reduction in guidance was attributable to currency?","James S. Sawyer","Just a couple of cents.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","The cash flows from the quarter were pretty great and your deferred taxes had $153 million benefit to cash flow. Is that temporary or did something happen so that you're paying less cash taxes?","James S. Sawyer","Well, the quarter was unusually high in cash flow. But basically, our cash flow is weaker in the first and second quarter and then it gets a lot stronger in the third and fourth quarter. As you mentioned, a large source of it was from deferred taxes, and that's partially related to strategy. We're going to take more advantage of accelerated depreciation this year and consequently not pay much cash taxes in the third quarter. So it will probably -- it's probably like $100 million higher than an average quarter would be.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then, secondly, what was the size of the settlement of the prior-year receivable in the Asian business?","James S. Sawyer","It's a couple of million and it's really just as a result of the fact that if we don't receive on-site committed payments, we don't book it as revenue. And we had a bit of a dispute with a customer and we're very aggressive in making sure that we do get paid these on-site payments and we collected it this quarter. So there's a couple of million dollars that we should have collected last year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Could you just give us a sense of start-ups in Russia, sort of what -- where we are in the evolution of that start-up and how much more -- how many more quarters it will be before you're fully up and running there or fully loaded?","Stephen F. Angel","Well, it's just -- this is Steve. We have roughly $8 million to $10 million that we're seeing on the sales front right now. I think, through the fourth quarter, maybe we'll be up around $20 million or so. And so that project continues to start up. We've got others that are starting up next year. I would say, by -- I think, we talked about this during Investor Day, we said that around 2017, that was our outlook, we'd be at about $250 million of sales. That was our projections, so continue to grow.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And just a follow-up separately, you mentioned the government shutdown in the U.S., and I just couldn't quite tell how much of it you're referencing for sort of an impact into the third quarter and then how much of it you're referencing sort of in terms of lingering into the fourth and maybe into the first quarter as it sort of ultimately remains unresolved so far?","Stephen F. Angel","Well, I think Jim's point was that the economy is demand-driven. And to the extent that there's any uncertainty, that prevents growth from starting again. So it was just a negative variable in the overall equation and that's why we're calling the fourth quarter in North America pretty much flat from a base volume standpoint. And we'll see what next year brings, but right now, we're just not seeing growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Steve and Jim, just in terms of the impacts of new projects for next year, are we still tracking towards roughly $0.30 of impact year-over-year?","Stephen F. Angel","Well, I'll go back to, David, what we said at the investor conference day, which is 3% to 4% is about what we expect really in any given year going forward. So if you did 3% to 4%, I think that probably puts you closer to $0.20 to $0.25.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Understood. And just on the electronics, Steve, any thoughts on weakness and strengths? Any signs that this might bottom on the -- at least on the solar side, and get some positive comparisons?","Stephen F. Angel","Not yet on the solar side. We're not seeing it deteriorate further but it's in pretty poor shape. But just to finish the thought on electronics, Samsung is seeing some increased activity on the memory chip and the DRAM side, so that's one positive indicator on the electronics side. But again, solar, no turnaround there and that's kind of the electronics story.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","In terms of merchant, it looked like volume is perking up a little bit in North America. Is that the base business getting a little bit better or is that just more new wins?","Stephen F. Angel","It was more oil wells -- this is Steve again, it's more oil well services had a very good quarter, both in Mexico and in Canada. But aside from that, I'd say merchant volumes are kind of flatlined.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, one quick one on PDI. The recovery there seems to -- well, it doesn't seem like it's happening on a volume front. Any issues you think in terms of the recovery there, any structural issues? It seems like that business in North America has been a little bit more sluggish than I would have thought coming out of the downturn?","Stephen F. Angel","Well, I would agree with that -- Steve again, except that it has rebounded. Certainly, it's rebounded quite nicely coming out of the recession. But right now, it does seem like it's not growing. And if you kind of break it down and look at it, automotives is a plus, chemicals is a plus. But there are certain negatives and they're obviously heavy equipment. Mining, for example, has been negative, and I think that's been well-documented. Public and private nonresidential spending remains very weak. And a lot of the big projects that we and others had anticipated really haven't transpired yet. So you kind of average all that out. That's why we're kind of in a place where we're not growing, not deteriorating. If I look at the volumes within our PDI business, it would say hard goods is certainly negative on the volume front, whereas gas is pretty much flat. I think, the good news for us and probably for the industry at large is that pricing has been pretty good.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I have a couple of questions on hydrogen. First, your history in hydrogen had some roots in ethylene off gas, I'm wondering, have you guys started working with any of these new mega projects that are coming out in the next few years to source some hydrogen? And then, secondly, what's your expectation about the outlook for the hydrogen business as it might correlate to the refinery customer's health? In other words, they're getting pretty skinny margins again. Do you ever see that? Any ramifications in your hydrogen business when that happens?","Stephen F. Angel","I'll just take your first question, Bob, Steve again. Yes, we do continue to work with sources, byproduct sources for hydrogen. Obviously, I won't go into any details around that. But it is in support of some of the projects that are being discussed. So we continue to do that with interest. But as far as do we anticipate seeing any deterioration in our hydrogen business as a result of skinnier margins, the answer is no. When they've gone through these cycles before, we really didn't see any effect on our hydrogen business. And I don't expect we would see it in this case either.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And Steve, I'm just curious, as you look forward, I think you guys have talked about how there's a little bit of a slower top line than maybe what you've seen in the last 5 or 10 years, how does your algorithm for earnings growth change, given this period where you're going to have increasing excess cash flow? Should we expect an increase in share repurchase or other financial methods for boosting the earnings growth?","Stephen F. Angel","Well, it will be in the 1% to 2% range in terms of share repurchases. And I think, with the CapEx spend moderating around $1.8 billion or so, and that's our production going forward and that's based on a backlog of about $2 billion of large projects, but if you run out that algorithm, that would say that I would expect 2%, closer to a 2% share count reduction, that share count reduction is about that you should expect, annual.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I want to go -- you guys have talked about kind of peak CapEx. Competitors in the industry aren't quite there yet. So when you look at the industry, one, do you see yourselves growing slower than the industry as far as capital going in the ground? And two, as the industry, do you think that starts to put pressure on return assumptions that get put into new business bid?","Stephen F. Angel","You want to take that?","James S. Sawyer","Well, I would say this, basically, we've always been very disciplined about the quality of the projects that we take on, the contracts we sign, the hurdle rates in terms of new projects and so forth. And I think, I still think, there are plenty of projects to go around for the industry, especially if you start counting these coal gasification projects in China and everywhere else. But we're trying to be risk averse and disciplined about our hurdle rates. And so we're -- we basically went through a little bit of a wave where there were very few projects signed during the recession. But in 2010, 2011, 2012, we signed a lot of projects that came out as a bulge, and that was really why last year's capital spending and this year's was high. We don't really see the outlook for new project opportunities getting any better or worse, we're just kind of coming out of that kind of bulge there.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And then, as you guys look at Russia, can you envision the time, maybe 8 to 10 years out, where Russia is as good for you as Brazil is today? Or you don't think you've got a shot at getting kind of that consolidated and concentrated in Russia?","Stephen F. Angel","It's hard for me to -- this is Steve, it's hard for me to forecast what's going to happen in Russia next quarter, much less 8 to 10 years out. But I mean, all kidding aside, I -- we would not have gone into Russia if we did not think we could build a critical mass, if we didn't think we could execute our strategy around integrated supply, which we are, on-site merchant and packaged gas and build density. And that is taking shape. We have 2 regions that we targeted. There will probably be a third later on. But we think that it's going to be a very good business for us and it will have very good returns. It's a lot of hard work, it's a lot of spadework. Construction is very challenging, as we've talked about in the past. But we get better with each project. And as far as what we're finding out as we start up these projects in terms of did it really -- is it panning out the way we'd expect it going in, I'd say yes. But we knew there would be challenges, there are challenges, but we think long term, we're going to be very pleased we made this move.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna.","Christopher Noon - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","This is actually Chris Noon stepping in for Don. Most of my questions have been answered, but I just wanted to ask on Brazil. I know on the last conference call, there was some mention of any impacts that the political protest in Brazil have maybe had on you guys. So I was wondering if you can maybe just give an update on that? And also, if you've seen any ramp-up ahead of the World Cup and Olympics?","Stephen F. Angel","Well, this is Steve again. With respect to protest, I think that's kind of old news. I mean, anytime anybody marches anywhere, it makes the newspapers in the United States. So we're not really seeing any effect of that. With respect to buildup going into the World Cup, that's pretty much behind us. So the buildup we would see now would be really more for the Olympics, which is a little ways down the road.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Christopher Perrella - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Chris Perrella on for Kevin. Just a couple of quick questions. Where do you see asset utilization for your separation units regionally? And could you go on a little bit more detail on pricing in Asia, what you're seeing in Lox\/Lin, electronics, LAR, other specialty gases?","Stephen F. Angel","Sure. So with respect to utilization, I'll talk about it in terms of liquid, and the numbers I give you will really be more Lin\/Lox because, obviously, utilization or supply-demand situation can vary by product. If you -- I'm just going to walk around the world. If you look at the U.S., we're about 80%, right about 80%. So we certainly have plenty of capacity left with Lin\/Lox in United States. Europe is around high 60s, mid to high 60s, I'll call it. Brazil would be in the low 80s. In Asia, China is around mid 80s. And obviously, they're seeing a much stronger growth trajectory than the rest of the world. So fairly balanced, I would say, in China right now. India has dropped down into the mid 70s and that's because there has been some projects that we started up over the last year or so and the economy is not doing all that great at this point. But with respect to the pricing, argon pricing in the solar market in China, it continues to be very weak, and I think it's going to stay that way until the capacity utilization situation changes and demand increases is really what has to happen for that to take place. But I don't expect anything in terms of argon price improvement until that happens.","Christopher Perrella - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just the liquid nitrogen and liquid oxygen in China pricing?","Stephen F. Angel","That has been pretty steady. A lot of the work we've been doing there has been on application development with direct end users as opposed to selling through the distribution channel, for example. And as we've done that hard work, pricing has certainly stabilized and it looks fine to me.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In North America, you talked about project growth in chemicals and metals. So the metals was a little surprising. Can you talk about that? And in chemicals, it's all the pet chem projects that are planned here. How much could that add to your backlog, let's say, in the next 3 to 4 years?","Stephen F. Angel","Well, P.J., this is Steve. So I would say in the chemical -- with respect to the chemical projects, we're watching it. We are on top of all of these projects that everybody is discussing. They're moving pretty slowly. There's a couple of issues. One is environmental permitting, which they all have to -- most of them have to go through, not all of them, and that takes some time. And then, I think, every time they go back and look at the estimates, the costs are going up. And that is going to continue to be a challenge in the Gulf Coast. And then, if you add on top of that some of the uncertainty that we talked about at the beginning of the call, that probably -- that certainly doesn't help with respect to people's desire to pull the trigger on these projects and start spending money. We believe, based on the projects that we're looking at, the ones that we're positioned for, the ones we think that will go forward, over the next, I'll call it, 4 to 5 years, we'll close 3 to 5 and probably start up 2 to 3. They tend to be on the larger size type of projects, probably $100 million to $200 million. So you can kind of do the math there and look at what that might add to the backlog. And then with respect to the metals project, one dynamic, and this is a byproduct of what's going on with cheap natural gas, is that if you look at a lot of the steel mills, integrated steel mills, particularly along the Great Lakes, they're substituting coke for natural gas because natural gas is low cost and obviously a cleaner fuel source. But as they do that, they need more oxygen in the furnace to maintain the thermal characteristics. And in some cases, we're seeing up to 25% more oxygen per ton of steel produced, based on low-cost natural gas substitution for coke. So when you kind of run that math through, you can see that we're a lot tighter in terms of our ability to supply oxygen than the steel mills up there in terms of their ability to supply steel. So our capacity utilization is a lot higher than theirs, and our estimation is that's going to lead to more projects.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's very helpful. And then, you had impressive margin gains in South America, despite the 10% currency drop, was there any incremental cost cutting down there to achieve higher margins?","Kelcey E. Hoyt","Incremental cost cutting.","Stephen F. Angel","Oh, incremental cost cutting. Yes, P.J. there is incremental cost cutting. The individual we have down there running South America is a very strong operator. And he took some cost out last year when obviously Brazil was a disaster. He took a lot of costs out. And he continues -- they have continued to pare away cost, as we do everywhere around the world.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Gulley with BGC Financial.","Mark R. Gulley - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. In China, somewhat of an environmental crackdown during this current 5-year plan, do you view that as a threat or an opportunity? A threat would tend to be in terms of are we going to get as many coal gasification projects as perhaps we think or maybe on the other side, it creates opportunity? That's my first question.","Stephen F. Angel","Well, Mark, this is Steve, I'll take that. I think, net-net, it's an opportunity for us. We have a lot of solutions that address cleaner air, cleaner water. So I do view that as a positive. As you know, we don't participate in a lot of the gasification projects that are taking place out there. We are very selective in the ones that we do participate in. And we've said that -- we anticipate we'll probably start up about 1 a year going forward. So we're not heavily reliant on gasification. I think that's just more a result of the fact that we're being selective. The thing that we are seeing today is a lot of projects are slower to close in China, and there's really 2 reasons. One is, again, a lot more attention being paid by the government on the environmental conditions around these projects. So as in the U.S., the permitting process has become the long pole in the tent. So projects are being delayed for that. And then, secondly, with the government's new offense against corruption, particularly corruption in state, on enterprises, we're actually seeing that slow down some decision making. So those 2 factors kind of in play. But net-net long term, we certainly view that as a positive.","Mark R. Gulley - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, you did talk a little bit about a little bit better profitability at NuCO2, but you announced that back in February, you were talking about a run rate of EBITDA $120 million, now it's a little bit higher. That was lower on operation to begin with. So can you talk a little bit about what you are seeing in terms of better EBITDA at NuCO2?","Stephen F. Angel","Well, we've owned it since March 1. We're very pleased with the results to date. If I go back and look at it against our assumptions, it's probably running a little ahead. And going forward, the formula is top line high single-digits. Pricing is a nice component of that. And obviously, that falls nicely to the bottom line. So high single-digit growth going forward. And we're looking at operating profit growth. I'm not going to talk EBITDA anymore, but operating profit growth would be in the mid-teens. And that's pricing, that's volume leverage against -- the infrastructure that they have, it's continuing to build density. That's taking advantage of lower-cost sources. As you know, we didn't go by much of the CO2 going in and continual productivity and there's a lot of productivity opportunities there around distribution.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Could you specifically talk about the hydrogen project backlog? So it doesn't seem to be much there right now.","Stephen F. Angel","This is Steve. That's correct. We have not added much in the way of hydrogen to the backlog. We started up 2 very large projects in Valero. We still have Chevron in the backlog. And I think it will be probably a few years, or a couple of years, at least, before we will be starting that one up. But large hydrogen activity in the U.S. really is -- there's not much going on with that respect. We are working on some hydrogen projects outside of the U.S. that look very positive. But in terms of large hydrogen projects that we would have interest in, and we look at everything, but in some of -- as Jim said earlier, we're very selective in what we participate in. They certainly have to meet our hurdle rate and a lot of them don't. But I think we are going to be doing some projects that we have some interest in. They're not going to be large in my estimation.","Operator","There are no questions at this time.

My name is Kirsty, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Kelcey Hoyt, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Kelcey E. Hoyt","Thanks, Kirsty. Good morning, and thank you for attending our second quarter earnings call and webcast. I'm joined this morning by Jim Sawyer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Liz Hirsch, our Vice President and Controller.","Today's presentation materials are available on our website at praxair.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference.","Please also note that our discussion of full year 2013 earnings excludes the impact of the Venezuela currency devaluation that occurred during the first quarter and a pension settlement charge that will be recorded in the third quarter. A reconciliation of the U.S. GAAP reported numbers appears in the appendices to this presentation and the press release.","Jim and I will now review Praxair's second quarter results, including the current business environment and updated earnings guidance. We'll then be available to answer questions.","James S. Sawyer","Thank you, Kelcey, and good morning, everyone. Praxair delivered record results again in the second quarter despite a landscape of mixed global economic conditions. While there's plenty of uncertainty in many markets and industries around the world, one thing is clear, the United States has become one of the lowest-cost producers for the refinery, chemical and steel industries. Fortunately for us, our on-site pipeline and merchant distribution is second to none in North America. We will continue to focus narrowly on our integrated production distribution strategy and continue to increase density among our on-site bulk and packaged gas customers in each of our key regions around the world.","We've been investing heavily over the past 2 years primarily to build on-site production plants, which are contracted by our core customers in our core geographies. Nearby on-site merchant and packaged gas customers, who use our applications technology, get the synergistic benefit of capitalizing on our system, improving both our customers' performance and our return on capital.","This year, we start our eighth plant for Samsung in Korea and we're currently starting up 2 worldscale hydrogen plants for Valero, one on our Texas pipeline complex and the other on our Louisiana pipeline, which we are currently expanding. Our pipeline [indiscernible] in the Midwest, which primarily serves the steel industry, are virtually sold out.","While we are not normally a very acquisitive company, we acquired 2 very successful franchises this year, which use our same distribution density model. NuCO2, which distributes liquid carbon dioxide to the restaurant industry, and Dominion Technology, which provides gases to the offshore oil industry, augmenting our existing oil well services business. We will continue to keep our narrow and deep focus and invest your capital wisely.","For the remainder of 2013, we are narrowing our earnings guidance to $5.90 to $6, taking $0.05 off the top end. This reduction is purely a result of recent currency movements which we assume will prevail for the rest of the year. Since we first gave earnings guidance of $5.85 to $6.10 in January, currency devaluation has impacted our expected results for the year by about $0.10.","We're also giving guidance for the third quarter of $1.48 to $1.53. The guidance puts us at double-digit EPS growth the second half of 2013.","Our consolidated outlook remains strong, with the strongest growth in North America and Asia on-site, while growth in Brazil and Europe are more uncertain.","If you look at the 4 charts on Slide 3, you'll see how conditions are vastly different depending on the end markets and geography. The upper left chart shows U.S. nonresidential construction spending since before the recession. I show this because it's one of the drivers of demand for machinery and metal fabrication, which are big end markets for packaged gases. You can see from the green line that privately funded construction plummeted and has only slightly recovered. Meanwhile, publicly funded construction continued to grow, primarily as a function of the American Jobs Act. Now with cuts in discretionary spending by all 3 levels of government, public spending on construction is falling.","Europe public spending on construction has been falling continuously as a result of the austerity programs. The lower left chart shows that our Spanish packaged gas sales have fallen by 30% over the past 5 years.","By comparison, our volumes in China have risen by threefold. These volumes are largely on-site, feeding the chemical, metals and energy industries.","Brazil, on the other hand, has been on a rocky road with double-dip and triple-dip recessions.","And now, I will let Kelcey explain in more detail our second quarter results.","Kelcey E. Hoyt","Thanks, Jim. Please turn to Slide 4 for our consolidated second quarter results. Praxair's second quarter results reflects solid growth in our on-site business, with the strongest growth in the energy, chemicals and steel industries in North and South America, as well as Asia. Merchant volumes grew more modestly with steady demand from health care and food and beverage markets. However, packaged gas demand weakened slightly across most regions due to poor overall business confidence and lower private and public spending on construction and capital projects.","Consolidated sales in the second quarter were $3 billion, up 7% versus the prior-year quarter. Underlying sales grew 4%, as strong volumes in South America and Asia were partially offset by lower volumes in Europe, while North America volumes were comparable to the prior-year quarter. Higher pricing was achieved in North America, South America, Europe and Surface Technologies. Industrial gas acquisitions in North America and Europe contributed 3% sales growth.","Operating profit was $665 million, up 5% as compared to the prior-year quarter from higher volumes, pricing and productivity gains, partially offset by higher depreciation and SG&A expense attributable to new plant startups and acquisitions.","EBITDA and operating margins remained strong at 31.6% and 22.1%, respectively.","Net income of $445 million increased 4% from the prior year, slightly less than operating profit due to higher interest expense from increased debt levels to fund acquisitions, as well as higher rates, as we have turned out most of our debt long-term to protect against rising interest rates.","Earnings per share of $1.49 grew 5% over the prior-year quarter, higher than net income growth due to a 1% reduction in the number of diluted shares outstanding as a result of net repurchases of common stock.","During the quarter, we repurchased $152 million of stock, net of issuances. $647 million remains available under the $1.5 billion share repurchase program authorized in January of last year.","Our after-tax return on capital this quarter is 13%, reflecting peak construction in progress on the balance sheet for plants that have not yet started or are just beginning to ramp up, as well as the acquisition of NuCO2. This really is more of a timing issue. Praxair's return on capital will start to trend upward in 2014 and 2015 as the full earnings contribution from new projects kicks in and merchant loadings ramp on new projects and our existing capacity.","Our CapEx backlog, which we define as projects greater than $5 million and associated with a fully executed long-term customer contract, is currently at $2.3 billion and comprised of 36 projects. During the quarter, we started 5 plants and signed 2 large long-term customer contracts for projects that are under construction. About 45% of the CapEx in the backlog is in North America and about 35% in Asia, with the rest in Europe and South America. The projects will serve customers in the energy, chemical, manufacturing, electronics and metals markets.","New proposals remain active. The largest amount of activity in our operating regions is in North America, followed by Asia and Russia.","Now please turn to Page 5 for our results in North America. Sales in North America were $1.6 billion, 11% above the prior-year quarter. Organic sales grew 2%, driven by continued strong price attainment with volumes comparable to the prior-year period. Growth from acquisitions was 6%, driven by NuCO2, as well as packaged gas distributors, of which we acquired 17 in 2002 and 5 year-to-date in 2013. The effects of cost pass-through, primarily higher natural gas price, which is contractually passed on to hydrogen customers, increased sales by 3%.","Our on-site business in North America continues to run at very high levels. In the United States, our customers in the process industry, such as steel, chemicals and refining, are continuing to take advantage of the low natural gas prices, cheap energy and high labor productivity, which makes them very competitive globally. We serve these customers through major pipeline networks in the Chicago and Gulf Coast regions of the United States, as well as various on-site plants.","Even though the overall steel industry capacity utilization remains in the high-70s, oxygen demand from our steel customers in the Chicago area continues to be significantly higher than a few years ago. Natural gas is increasingly being used in the blast furnaces as a cost-competitive substitute for coal. This shift to higher natural gas usage is requiring 25% more oxygen per ton of steel produced to maintain the desired thermal characteristics of a blast furnace.","Oil refiners benefit directly from low-cost natural gas and low-cost hydrogen, which is produced from natural gas using a steam methane reforming process. Refiners, for example, convert through a hydrocracking process utilizing steam and hydrogen 1 barrel of low-value vacuum gas oil into 1.2 barrels of high-value transportation fuels.","Earlier this week, we announced the start-up of 135 million standard cubic foot per day hydrogen plant serving Valero's refinery in Port Arthur, Texas, as well as other customers in the region. The plant is connected to our existing Gulf Coast pipeline system, which is more than 300 miles long, and brings total capacity in the region to about 750 million standard cubic feet per day. In addition, the network includes our unique 2.5 billion standard cubic foot high-purity hydrogen storage cavern that provides additional supply reliability for Praxair customers along the pipeline.","Our similar sized worldscale hydrogen plant serving Valero St. Charles, Louisiana refinery is scheduled to be commissioned and start up during the third quarter.","Merchant volumes grew 1% year-over-year and sequentially. Our Lox\/Lin capacity utilization rates in the U.S. are running at about 80%.","North American packaged gas sales excluding acquisitions and foreign currency were up 1% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially, as positive pricing more than offset lower volumes in all 3 countries, the United States, Canada and Mexico. In PDI, gases growth was positive, but hard goods volumes were lower than the prior-year quarter. By end market, the U.S. packaged gas business is seeing strength in auto and chemicals, with modest weakness in metal fabrication and mining, while manufacturing is steady.","North American operating profit was $381 million, 5% above the prior-year quarter. The increase in operating profit from higher pricing and acquisitions was partially offset by higher costs, primarily seasonal power costs and increased pension expense. The packaged gas acquisitions we made in the past year are in the process of being integrated, which will improve profitability.","The operating margin remains strong at 24.5%. Higher cost pass-through, which increased sales with minimal impact on operating profit, reduced the operating margin percentage by 70 basis points year-over-year and 30 basis points sequentially.","Proposal activity for new on-site plants in North America remained solid in chemicals, metals, energy and manufacturing.","Now please turn to Page 6 for our results in Europe. Our European businesses are primarily in Spain and Italy, which comprise about 50% of the European segment sales. Other operating locations include the Ruhr Valley in Germany, the port of Antwerp, Scandinavia and more recently, Russia.","The northern part of Europe is clearly performing better than the southern part, as Spain and Italy are still suffering from a lack of government spending and a lack of credit availability from the banks.","Sales in Europe were $382 million, which was comparable with the prior-year quarter. Higher pricing was offset by lower volumes, primarily lower merchant and packaged gas lines in Spain and Italy due to continued weak industrial activity.","We continue to drive price attainment, and operating profit of $69 million was up 1% due to positive operating leverage from price, productivity and the benefits of prior restructure actions.","We are on track to deliver annual savings of more than $18 million from the third quarter 2012 restructure at a payback of less than 1.5 years. The segment is well positioned for further market improvements as volumes stabilize in Southern Europe and we begin to further start up and load the new plants in Russia.","In Russia, we are executing our profitable growth strategy by building production distribution density. During June, we announced the acquisition of VOF, a merchant liquid and packaged gas business. VOF serves more than 2,000 customers in a variety of industries, including steel, aerospace, health care and food and beverage. The acquisition provides immediate synergies with our existing regional infrastructure, including our newly built air separation plant in Volgograd, serving a large chemical customer under long-term contract.","During July, we announced a joint venture with KuibyshevAzot, also in the Volga region, to produce and sell industrial gases. The joint venture will construct a new air separation plant to produce 1,400 tons per day of oxygen, nitrogen and argon that is scheduled to start up in mid-2016. The joint venture will also own and operate KA's existing air separation unit. The merchant liquid supply will support the surrounding industrial region, including energy, automotive and manufacturing customers.","Praxair's modernization and new plant investment will bring significant energy efficiency and cost savings to the company, while increasing the supply of liquefied industrial gases to serve the growing demand from smaller regional customers. This will be Praxair's fifth on-site project in Russia and third in the Volga region.","During the second quarter, we also announced the expansion of our supply system in the port of Antwerp, the second largest petrochemical enclave in the world after Houston, Texas. We will build a 1,300 ton per day plant and extend our pipeline system in the port to expand our business with customers under long-term take-or-pay contracts, including agreements with several leading global chemical companies. Start-up of the air separation plant is expected in early 2016.","The pipeline system will have the ability to supply oxygen and nitrogen to the majority of chemical companies in the port. In addition, the new facility will produce liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon to support customers in the pharmaceutical, chemical, glass, metal fabrication and food industries in Belgium and the Netherlands.","Page 7 shows our results in South America. During the quarter, we saw an improving volume trend to metals, manufacturing, health care and chemicals customers, similar to what we had seen with the recovery from the recession beginning in March of this year.","South American segment sales were $536 million, up 3% versus the prior-year quarter. Underlying sales grew a strong 9% year-over-year and 5% sequentially excluding negative currency impact.","Operating profit in South America was $123 million, up 12% versus the prior year. Excluding currency effects, operating profit in the quarter increased 18%, demonstrating strong operating leverage from higher volume and continued execution of price and productivity, including the results of last year's fixed cost actions.","So while we have seen a somewhat bumpy recovery the last few months in Brazil, the outlook for the second half of 2013 remains mixed. The currency weakened 8% against the U.S. dollar versus the rates in place in April, which does have a primarily translational impact on our results.","Current Brazil Central Bank consensus industrial production for the year is now 2.2%, which implies an industrial production rate of about 3% for the second half of the year. The business has and will continue to take action to adjust to changing economic conditions as needed, as was indicated in the strong operating margin for the second quarter.","Now please turn to Slide 8 for our results in Asia. Sales of $379 million grew 9% versus the prior-year quarter. Strong volume growth increased sales by 10% due to higher volumes in China, India and Korea, driven by about 2\/3 new project growth and about 1\/3 base business growth. Volume growth in this segment was strongest to metals, manufacturing, chemicals and energy customers.","We continue to grow merchant sales to customers through our application technologies across Asia. Our offerings provide energy reduction, environmental solutions and productivity to our customers. 2 such examples are combustion and water treatment.","Lower merchant and packaged gas pricing reduced sales by 1% from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to liquid argon in regions of China impacted in part by the weak solar market. In addition, electronics gases pricing in Asia, which is used in solar, LCD and integrated circuits, continues to be weak.","Asia's operating profit of $61 million decreased 10% from the prior-year quarter due to a gain on sale of land in the prior-year quarter.","Strong volumes resulted in a 15% operating profit increase year-over-year, which was partially offset by lower pricing.","Praxair is one of the largest atmospheric gases suppliers to Samsung, and during the quarter, we started up our second state-of-the-art air separation plant at the Samsung Electronics semiconductor facility in Hwasung, Korea. Through a long-term contract, the plant will supply on-site high-purity oxygen, nitrogen and argon to Samsung.","The air separation plant will also expand Praxair's merchant capacity in the region, supplying liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon to a variety of industries, including nonferrous metal, wastewater treatment and shipbuilding.","In addition to atmospheric gases, Praxair supplies hydrogen, helium, processed gases, sputtering targets, ALD precursors and other advanced materials for use in Samsung's manufacturing processes.","Our results for Surface Technologies are shown on Page 9. Surface Technologies sales for the quarter were $165 million, comparable with the prior-year excluding currency and cost pass-through. Higher pricing in the quarter partially offset the impact of lower volumes of industrial coatings.","Operating profit increased $4 million or 15% in the second quarter. The impact of higher pricing and lower costs, including benefits of prior restructure program, more than offset the impact of lower volumes.","And with that, I'd like to turn this call over to Q&A. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Please standby for your first question, which comes from the line of Mike Sison from KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Jim, when you take a look at the second half of the year, in terms of double-digit earnings growth that you're looking for, how much of that is coming from sort of the backlog and new projects coming in?","James S. Sawyer","Virtually all of it.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. So the outlook there is pretty, pretty firm to some degree?","James S. Sawyer","Yes. I mean, I don't -- we're not looking for any major economic expansion in any of the countries that we operate in that would drive significant amount of volume growth. So it's mostly from the projects.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just a quick follow up. In terms of pricing, it seems like you guys did a good job at getting pricing. So far this year, Air Products is complaining a little bit about being squeezed from higher energy costs and lack of pricing. Are you seeing any of that type of issues at all this year?","James S. Sawyer","I can't comment on Air Products says, but I know our guys work very, very hard on pricing and their very scientific method and artful method to make it happen. So about the pricing, I don't see any problems in the environment. Generally for pricing, with the exception of argon pricing in China, which I think most people know is off because the largest consumer in China had been the photovoltaic panel business, about half of which has shut down versus last year. So that took away a big demand for argon in China.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edward Yang from Oppenheimer.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Is there anything to read into the relative weakness in packaged gases versus the bulk in merchant in North America? Is that a leading indicator for base volumes there?","James S. Sawyer","I think it's just a different end market, okay? I wouldn't call it a leading indicator. It's just that packaged gases go into many, many, many applications. But about half of it goes to welding, metal fabrication and machinery, all of which happen more when people are building things. And what I see right now is that the private sector is not building very much and the public sector is not building very much. And that's what I think is the cause of the relative weakness in packaged gases. But it's just a different end market than merchant and on-site.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the backlog dipped a little bit, and I think in the prior quarter, you said it will probably be a little lumpy, fluctuate from $2 billion to $2.5 billion. Is that kind of your current thinking still?","James S. Sawyer","Yes, that's still our thinking.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","The results in Brazil were pretty great in that your operating profits grew about $9 million with virtually no revenue growth. Is that a onetime event? Or is that -- this kind of cost reduction something that stretches out into the future?","James S. Sawyer","It's basically 2 things: a lot of cost reduction and efficiency -- well, there's 3 things: a lot of cost reduction and efficiency. You can see we got 3% price in Brazil. And lastly, I think in the last 12 months or so, we have been operating with some dislocations in our supply systems that we got ironed out in the first quarter.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, when does Valero St. Charles actually start up? I know you said it's the third quarter. Is that the end of this quarter, or has it started already? Where does that stand?","James S. Sawyer","It will probably be in the middle of the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Gulley from BGC Financial.","Mark R. Gulley - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","A couple of things. One, with respect to quantifying the impact of those gaseous hydrogen startups alluded to earlier, is there any way you can size those in terms of sales impact for the second half of the year?","James S. Sawyer","Well, I think we've given the earnings guidance. The sales impact, to some extent, is a function of natural gas prices, so we don't really focus so much on the sales impact. If you want to follow up with Kelcey on that, it's fine.","Mark R. Gulley - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Sure. You said you're not very acquisitive, but yet you did make some 2 very interesting acquisitions, NuCO2 in the U.S.; Dominion in the U.K. Can you talk about what you're doing and what you want to do to globalize both of those platforms?","James S. Sawyer","That's a good question. NuCO2 primarily operates in the U.S. It requires a very, very high density of fast food locations. And I think there's a potential in Asia and Brazil for that. There's probably less potential in Europe for it because the restaurants have to be designed basically, a new design that has room for the tank and the system in it. And these small pubs and stuff in Europe just don't have the space for that, plus they just don't consume as much beverage drinks in Europe, they tend to be more bottled. Now Dominion, I think we can leverage very well around the world. And we can leverage back and forth our U.S. and Mexican oil services and Canadian oil services business with the products that they have to offer.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Jim, just in terms of new plant startups and their impact in 2014, do you have an early read on the EPS impact that it could provide to earnings growth?","James S. Sawyer","Well, it's kind of early in the year for us to make comments about 2014. But the impact of startups in this year has slid a little bit later in the year, and that's -- some of that sliding into 2014. So I'm going to say off the top of my head maybe $0.30 of EPS, but it kind of depends on timing.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And, Jim, just on the Lox\/Lin pricing question, even though you're not seeing any pricing pressure, are you seeing any evidence in the marketplace that there's a little more competitive intensity in Lox\/Lin pricing amongst your competitors?","James S. Sawyer","No.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Laurence from Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just a quick one. As you look at the cadence of discussions with your on-site customers, is the -- we're going to be rolling forward from a 2013 to 2016 to a 2014 to 2017 backlog in the near future. Should we expect a significant step-up? Or do you see a fairly flat cadence from here? I mean, how should we translate the outlook -- the backlog comments versus the active order pipeline?","James S. Sawyer","Well, I mean, let me try to frame it this way. On-site was about 25% of our sales last year, I think 26% this year. As these projects start up and absent any acquisitions in merchant and packaged, on-site will move up to about 30% of sales in the next couple of years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Sheehan from SunTrust.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Do you expect -- on North American margins, do you sort of expect them to stay in this 24% to 25% range for the next few quarters given the impact of the NuCO2 acquisition and sort of the dynamics of where natural gas prices are moving?","James S. Sawyer","Yes, I do. The NuCO2 has margins right in that zone. Our margin, I think, this quarter was impacted by about 70 basis points from the increase in natural gas prices, and, of course, they could increase a lot more, and that would depress margins a little bit. But generally speaking, I think we can continue margins in the mid-20s. That's really the way we operate. And the challenge is for us to get the other regions up to that level.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And on packaged gases, are you seeing any impact from whether that might have affected nonresidential construction during the quarter and maybe push some of it further into this quarter, or -- what impacts of weather have you seen?","James S. Sawyer","I just don't know. I haven't heard it mentioned by anybody. But if you want to follow up with Kelcey, you can do that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs.","Neal Sangani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is actually Neal Sangani on for Bob. Just looking to get a sense of the European restructuring actions. Do you think you can continue to get year-over-year margin growth with what looks like a flattish outlook on sales?","James S. Sawyer","Well, I think what we've done in Europe is essentially, we downsized and rationalized packaged gas filling stations, following that chart that I showed about packaged gas volumes being down so much. If we see some economic recovery in Europe and if we see governments start to repair bridges and railroads and stuff like that and some private capital spending, our volumes would definitely come up. And they would come up with a very strong incremental operating margin because we'd be able to do that without adding cost. But the jury is out on when Europe is going to recover.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer from Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","The question -- the first question is around Russia. Again, some nice transactions there. Could you maybe flesh out your Russian strategy a little bit? 2 things. One, what could that business -- or how big could that business be in 3 to 5 years? And then the second is, how do you think about risk, or how does risk get priced into deals you would do in Russia vis-\u00e0-vis maybe something in Brazil or something in China?","James S. Sawyer","Well, I would describe our -- the evolution of our Russian strategy, starting off with caution and really thinking through the risk management strategies, such as having contracts denominated in euros or dollars, having contracts guaranteed by offshore companies and so forth, and, of course, making sure that we are serving very viable, low-cost facilities of customers. So those are the kind of bottom line risk things that we have to manage. Additionally, construction in Russia is more difficult. You have -- you've got a lot of red tape you got to go through. And so we're learning our way through that. So we've got a couple of projects under construction. We've got a couple more that we are likely to sign shortly. There's probably more opportunity there than we have appetite to take on at the moment until we see how it plays out.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And then, again, good strides, the eighth plant for Samsung. How -- have you taken meaningful market share at Samsung? And roughly, what would you guess your market share is there?","James S. Sawyer","I don't think we've taken market share. I think we've already -- always had about a 50% market share there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Could you just help me understand the mix impact in Asia a little better just because I see volume up a lot. I know you have the new plant startups, so maybe there's some cost absorption there. But even adjusting for the sale in the prior year, I just wonder what the trajectory of margin should be from here.","James S. Sawyer","Right. Yes, as you mentioned, we had a -- it's actually a land sale in Korea the prior year, which contributed roughly $10 million to operating profit, which we disclosed last year. So if you take that out, we're still getting pretty good improvement in operating leverage. The sore spot, as I mentioned before, in China relates to very low argon pricing. And that has been, if you want to call it, the mix effect that has hurt the margins a little bit. A small impact in Thailand from our shrimp freezing business being a little bit slower. A small impact in Korea from seasonally higher power cost. But nothing that's really a trend that you would expect to continue. So we really should have margins back in the high-teens going forward.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow-up on -- you called out in Brazil the impacts of the political protests, and I'm just curious, is that something that you're seeing an impact from today or something that you're concerned about potentially flaring up?","James S. Sawyer","Well, we haven't seen nor do I expect that we will see any operational impacts [indiscernible] plants and distribution in any of the rest of that, okay? So my concern is whether there ends up being a bigger impact on the currency, which, of course, would hurt our translation rates, or whether there's a bigger impact on slowing the economic recovery. So those are just the 2 areas of concern.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Donald Carson from Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","A question on PDI, on same-store sales growth, just the difference between hard goods and gases and rent, and would the weakness in hard goods keep margins in that same mid-teens level? And, Jim, you mentioned the current weakness in nonresidential construction primarily. Do you see that just temporary? Or do you see the need to maybe do some rationalization in PDI, such as consolidation of filling stations or anything like that?","James S. Sawyer","I don't see any -- well, I mean, we're always doing some cost based restructuring, building modern filling stations and closing down a couple of smaller less productive ones. So we're always doing a little bit of that, but I don't -- I'm actually quite optimistic about packaged gases in the U.S. Our same-store sales in gases are up, but in hard goods, they are down. And I can't be sure about this, but my opinion is that people who are contractors to the government, the military and so forth are deferring decisions to buy the equipment until they see what their future workload is going to be. So I do think it will improve.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And then just as a follow-up, are you doing any hedging of the real for the balance of the year or into 2014?","James S. Sawyer","No, we're not.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on Brazil. Jim, your volume there increased 4% on a sequential basis. I'm just wondering if you're starting to see -- or I guess, that was a Latin American figure. But my question relates to Brazil. Wondering if you're starting to see a more meaningful uplift ahead of World Cup and Olympics, or perhaps there are other factors driving the increase there?","James S. Sawyer","Well, let me start out with this, the first quarter in Brazil has got Christmas holidays, summer and Carnival, okay? And it's always the weakest quarter of the year in Brazil. So the sequential buildup in the second quarter is to be expected. Additionally, we were seeing in February, March, April, May and June auto production increasing and manufacturing increasing and a nice healthy trend-up in underlying demand. I don't know whether that's going to continue through the rest of the year or not.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then second question, if I may. Last couple of quarters, you'd been repurchasing shares at a rate of approximately $150 million per quarter. As your CapEx ebbs a little bit from the peak last year, is that a reasonable pace to expect in coming quarters as you sit here today?","James S. Sawyer","I will describe it this way, what we've said is that our long-term expectation is to reduce the share count by between 1% and 2% per year. So that covers not just repurchased shares, but it also covers any creep from options and so forth. And our long-term cash flow projection shows that we have the ability to do that because we generate very strong operating cash flows. So that's kind of the range. This year, because we acquired NuCO2, they will probably be closer to 1%. But next year, as capital spending falls and there probably won't be any bigger acquisitions, it will probably speed up again.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison from First Analysis.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","We're hearing that some of the Gulf Coast refiners have recently been running pretty hard, driven by higher export demand for fuels. Can you talk about how that benefits you in the near-term and maybe what kind of opportunities it could present in the long-term, particularly as we're thinking about how that trend might play out against increasing light and sweet crude feedstocks coming from shale areas that might require less hydrogen over time?","James S. Sawyer","Well, let me try and characterize it this way. If you roll the clock back 5 or 10 years ago, I think we all would've believe that by now and in the future, the U.S. would be moving to a higher proportion of heavy sour crude, some of which potentially coming from the tar sands area. But with the advent of horizontal drilling, there's not only a lot of natural gas available, but there are heavy natural gas liquids and there is also a type of crude which has high carbon content but not high sulfur content. And when the refiners refine that type of crude, they can essentially blend hydrogen into it in the hydro frac-ing process and increase the volumetric output of diesel fuel and jet petroleum and so forth. So put it this way, the drive for hydrogen from sulfur reduction is probably less than we would have expected it to be, but the drive for hydrogen for hydro frac-ing is probably getting more than we'd expected it to.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And then you mentioned the European and South American restructuring savings. Are those both fully baked into the second quarter results? Or are there still some additional savings that we're kind of yet to see the full run rate?","James S. Sawyer","Well, the South American ones are probably pretty well baked in. Europe has got further to go as the year progresses. And restructuring is kind of a permanent process. It's not necessarily a headcount reduction or whatever, but it's a way of getting higher productivity. So there's always going to be more there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar from Citi.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Jim, your chemical volumes were quite good, and the many new chemical plants that are being proposed are in their field study. So at what point do gas companies get involved? And can you size the opportunity in the U.S. chemicals business for you?","James S. Sawyer","Right. Well, I guess we ought to talk about that by country. I presume you're talking about the Gulf Coast. And as chemical production facilities get constructed on the Gulf Coast, there will be increasing demand for a number of the products and services that we do. We are certainly going to play in that as it develops. But we also signed a big contract in Antwerp, which I think is the second largest petrochemical complex in the world, and then most of the chemicals growth is coming in China. It's coming in the form of coal gasification for a chemical feedstock. So I think the outlook is positive everywhere. And I'll put it this way, until 5 years ago, we would have said that all the chemical production would either be built in the Middle East, where the petroleum and gas is from, or it'd be built in China. That equation has now changed for the better for the United States.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","When these new plants get built, is it a number like they may need 10 or 15 ASUs? Is it a scale or size that you think about on the Gulf Coast?","Kelcey E. Hoyt","In the Gulf Coast, so scaler size for -- I mean, no, it all depends on the plant they're building, the chemical downstream product, that would drive the size of the industrial gases needed.","James S. Sawyer","I mean, there are about 20 projects that are being kicked around, some huge oxygen consumers, some not oxygen consumers at all. I do not expect all 20 projects to get built. So the counter remains to be seen how they come out.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then, Jim, you had mentioned on the last call that your CapEx may have peaked. Wondering if you see CapEx coming down in the next few years. Can you just quantify that for us?","James S. Sawyer","Yes, last year we had $0.2 billion in CapEx. And we're probably going to be in the $1.8 billion to $2 billion range this year and probably over the course of the next several years. And so I think it's peaked. I don't think that you can really attribute that to some cyclicality, except for the fact that during the recession in 2008 and 2009, we didn't sign very many contracts. And therefore, with a 3-year delay period, we didn't start up a lot of projects in 2011 and 2012. So there was kind of a swelling effect there, with more projects that came into the backlog and came higher CapEx. But I think that around $1.8 billion to $2 billion is a good range for us. We're not going after every project in the world. We're just focusing on projects in zones where we can get integration between our on-site and merchant businesses and people who are low risk. And we're very selective about it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John McNulty from Credit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Early in the call, Kelcey had mentioned something to the effect that because of the shift, I guess, at some of the steel furnaces or steel mills to using natural gas just because it's so cheap, you were seeing these burn up 10% or 20% more oxygen. Are there any other major industries that because of the natural gas shift actually change the demand for oxygen as well?","James S. Sawyer","That's a good question. Certainly, the steel industry does. It's increasing the penetration, tons of oxygen per ton of steel produced. Perhaps you see that in the refining industry with the heavy crude and the natural gas. And one of the big growth platforms for us for decades has been increasing penetration in the same customers in the same industries. So we've spent a lot of R&D time looking at that, and we'll chat with our R&D people to see if they have some ideas there.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just a quick question on the NuCO2 platform. Can you just discuss what the year-over-year growth was for that business? I know you haven't owned it that long, but how should we think about kind of the growth trend in that business for the quarter?","James S. Sawyer","Well, we haven't owned it long enough for that, but I'm going to suggest that 2% per quarter -- or sequentially, 8% is kind of the area that we expect growth to come there. And I'll also say that the number of new contract signings since we bought it well exceeds what was in our due diligence analysis when we made the analysis to decide to buy it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts from UBS.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I think that the health care business is noncyclical, but not necessarily high growth, and you've got 6% global growth in the back of your hand out in terms of your global markets. That means a number of areas must be well above 6%, I guess. So maybe you could comment on where you're seeing such high-growth in the health care.","James S. Sawyer","It's in a variety of places. It's not a huge growth business, but...","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And I don't think of that.","James S. Sawyer","One thing I would point to, if you look at the South American slide, we had price at 3%. I'm sure that some of the health care growth that we're showing on that slide is coming from pricing. It's probably also coming from higher helium sales to MRI machines, although I can't confirm that, but it's miscellaneous.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Would it be one of your highest price appreciation markets then?","James S. Sawyer","No, not necessarily. But it's a big business in South America, and South America had a lot of price.","Kelcey E. Hoyt","Okay. Thank you very much -- thank you. So thanks for participating in our second quarter earnings call. I would ask that you could note the following dates on your calendar.
