Your host today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chief Executive Officer of PCA. Upon conclusion of his narrative, there will be a Q&A session.","I will now turn the conference call over to Mr. Kowlzan. And please proceed when you are ready.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, and thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's second quarter 2015 earnings release conference call.","I'm Mark Kowlzan, CEO of PCA. And with me on the call today are Paul Stecko, our Chairman; Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs our Packaging business; Judy Lassa, Senior Vice President who runs our White Papers business; and Rick West, Chief Financial Officer; and Bob Mundy, who will succeed Rick as CFO effective September 1.","I'll begin the call with an overview of our second quarter results and operations, and then I'll turn the call over to Tom, Judy, and Rick, who'll provide more details. During our prepared comments, we'll be referring to slides that are posted on our website. I'll then wrap things up and we'll be glad to take questions.","Yesterday, we reported second quarter net income of $114 million or $1.16 per share compared to last year's second quarter net income of $100 million or $1.01 per share. Second quarter net income included net charges for the Boise integration and the DeRidder Louisiana mill restructuring of $2 million or $0.02 per share.","Excluding special items, net income was a record $116 million or $1.18 per share compared to last year's net income of $114 million or $1.15 per share. Net sales were $1.5 billion in both the second quarter of 2015 and 2014.","As shown on slide four, earnings of $1.18 per share were $0.15 higher than our prior guidance. Higher than guidance earning of $0.06 per share were driven by outstanding operations in both our mills and box plants, especially considering that five of our mills were down during the quarter for their annual outages. The benefits from the work we completed in the first quarter at the DeRidder mill during its extended annual outage were realized faster than we expected.","The ability to produce virgin, high-performance linerboard grades on D3, plus the improvements we made on D1, allowed us to make more lightweight containerboard and other specialty grade at DeRidder and shift other grades to accounts in Valdosta mills. This resulted in record productivity on a tons-per-day basis and lower mill cost at all three of these mills.","In corrugated products, our sales mix improved seasonally more than we expected, contributing another $0.05 per share. In addition, lower mill outage costs, lower purchased pulp costs, a lower tax rate and other items each contributed an additional $0.01 per share in earnings.","Looking at slide five, earnings were up $0.02 per share compared to the second quarter of 2014. Production in sales volume increase has added $0.10 per share to earnings, a richer mix in corrugated products increased earnings by $0.02 per share, lower energy costs increased earnings $0.07 per share. Lower chemical costs increased earnings $0.02 per share and a lower tax rate improved earnings over last year's second quarter by about $0.04 per share. These earnings improvements were partially offset by lower white paper prices and mix changes which reduced earnings by $0.10 per share, higher labor and benefit costs of $0.05 per share, lower export containerboard prices of $0.02 per share, higher annual outage costs, $0.03 per share and higher wood costs of $0.02 per share.","EBITDA and margins in the packaging segments were up over second quarter of last year, with EBITDA of $267 million and sales of $1.142 billion, or a 23.4% margin compared to the second quarter of 2014 packaging EBITDA of $259 million excluding special items, with sales of $1.145 billion, or a 22.6% margin.","Moving into more details of operations. Containerboard production in the second quarter was 937,000 tons, up 91,000 tons compared to last year's second quarter, driven primarily by 79,000 tons or 875 tons per day produced on D3 machine at DeRidder. The D3 machine produced 59,000 tons of linerboard and 20,000 tons of corrugating medium. With the D3 production, we reduced our upside purchases of containerboard by 56,000 tons compared to last year's second quarter. The D3 machine contributed about $0.06 per share to our second quarter earnings.","We plan to take our D3 machine down at DeRidder in September for 13 days to install additional dryers, which will provide the capability to achieve full design capacity of 1,000 tons per day and lower cost. We pulled up some work from next year's DeRidder annual outage to better utilize the downtime and also accrue benefits earlier.","Our containerboard inventory at the end of the second quarter was down 4,000 tons from year-end levels and about 1,400 tons below the end of the first quarter. Our ending inventory level at the end of the quarter is where we wanted to be to meet our seasonally stronger third quarter demand, especially with the lost production from the planned D3 machine outage in September. Our containerboard inventories at our box plants are also higher than what we've historically carried as a result of transportation issues, which I think most of you are familiar with.","Looking at changes in containerboard mill costs, our overall wood costs are up year-over-year driven exclusively by our Northern mills. Wood costs in our Southern mills are actually slightly down. Energy costs in our packaging business were down compared to both the second quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year, driven by lower purchased fuel prices and also lower usage.","Purchased electricity prices were up compared to last year's second quarter. However, purchased electricity consumption was down about 20% from both the conversion of D3 machine from newsprint to containerboard, which requires less electricity. And we also self-generated more electricity at our mills, which more than offset the higher prices.","I'll now turn it over to Tom who will provide more details on containerboard sales and our corrugated business.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President-Corrugated Products","Thank you, Mark. Corrugated product shipments were up 2.1% in total and per work day over a very strong second quarter of last year. As Mark said earlier, in corrugated products, our sales mix was better than we expected when we provided guidance and also compared to last year's second quarter. Part of the richer mix, we believe, is coming from additional higher value-added volume as we migrate the Boise packaging plants towards higher-margin business. We are making progress, but the migration takes time to complete, and we have more work to do.","Our outside sales of containerboard were up about 21,000 tons compared to last year's second quarter, with domestic containerboard sales down 4,000 tons and exports up 25,000 tons. Domestic prices were comparable to last year and export prices were lower.","I will now turn it back to Mark.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Tom. EBITDA and sales were down in our Paper segment compared to the second quarter of last year, with EBITDA at $37 million and sales of $281 million, or a 13.2% margin compared to the second quarter of 2014, with EBITDA of $45 million excluding special items and sales of $295 million, or a 15.3% margin.","I'm pleased with our Paper segment results considering the earnings impact from lower paper prices, which we were able to partially offset with improvements in operations.","I'll now turn it over to Judy Lassa, who will provide more operating details.","Judith M. Lassa - Senior Vice President-Paper","Thank you, Mark. Office paper shipments, which represent about 65% of our volume, were up 3,000 tons compared to last year's second quarter, or 1.7%. Printing and converting shipments were also about 6,000 ton over last year's second quarter. Pressure-sensitive paper shipments were down about 8,000 tons compared to last year, driven by market conditions and pulp shipments were up about 2,000 tons versus last year.","Paper prices were down compared to last year's second quarter, driven primarily by changes in industry trade publications for major grades and changes in the mix of paper products we sold. With the most recent published paper price decrease of $10 per ton, the current published price per office paper is $35 per ton lower than the average price for the second quarter of 2014. Fortunately, we've been able to offset some of the earnings reduction from lower published paper prices and mix changes with continued improvements in both paper mill cost and productivity.","During the second quarter, we also completed annual outages at the International Falls, Minnesota and Wallula, Washington mills. Wood costs were comparable to last year, while energy, chemical and freight costs were lower than last year's second quarter.","I will now turn it over to Rick West.","Richard B. West - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Judy. As mentioned earlier, earnings improved by about $0.04 per share compared to the second quarter of last year from a lower tax rate. Our second quarter 2015 effective tax rate of 35% was about 2% lower than the second quarter last year primarily due to an increased domestic manufacturers' deduction, resulting from having less tax net operating losses applied against taxable income that we had \u2013 the net tax operating losses were acquired with the acquisition of Boise. The third quarter tax rate is expected to be about the same as the second quarter of 2015.","As shown on slide six, cash provided by operations in the second quarter was $196 million after deducting $78 million in cash tax payments for federal and state income taxes. Other uses of cash included capital expenditures of $86 million, common stock dividends of $54 million, share repurchases of $36 million and a scheduled term loan payment of $2 million. We ended the quarter with $164 million of cash on hand.","I'll now turn it back over to Mark.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Rick. Before I move to the third quarter outlook, I want to update you on the progress in achieving synergies from the Boise acquisition. As we reported in our fourth quarter earnings call in January 2015, we realized $100 million in synergies in 2014. The remaining $100 million of targeted synergies consists of both capital project initiatives and other identified opportunities, to increase productivity and optimize operations.","Through the first half of 2015, we've realized about an additional $30 million of synergies, with more in the second quarter than the first quarter. This brings our total earnings improvement from synergies to $130 million. At the end of the second quarter, our annual run rate realization of synergies is at about $170 million, or 85% of our $200 million synergy target.","Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect higher containerboard, corrugated products and white paper shipments, and lower mill annual outage costs and lower chemical costs. White paper prices are expected to be lower with announced price changes in industry trade publications. And finally, the September outage on D3 machine at DeRidder will result in about 13,000 tons of lost production. Considering these items, we expect the third quarter earnings of $1.28 per share.","Finally, yesterday, we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $150 million of the company's outstanding common stock. Together with the remaining authority under previously announced programs, the company can repurchase $205 million of additional shares. This share repurchase program, together with our dividend increases announced earlier this year, demonstrates PCA's strong operating performance and cash generation, as well as our continuing commitment to return value to shareholders.","With that, we'll be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. These statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.","And with that, operator, I'd like to open the call to questions please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. And...","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Anthony.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","...congratulations to Rick and Bob on their transitions.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you very much.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","On DeRidder, I was wondering if you could give some color on what work was completed maybe a little bit faster than expected in the quarter. And then following the installation of the dryers in September, it's principally all of the large work on DeRidder done and then the $60 million EBITDA contribution that you had guided to, I think, late last year, is that still intact on an annualized basis?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Anthony, if you go back to the April call when we talked about coming out of the March outage, we explained the problems we had had with the vendor-supplied equipment on D1. And so, we were essentially running a crippled to that period of time until we could get the corrected hardware. And also we're still ramping up D3 and working on overall cost efficiencies and productivity and continuing to fine-tune the grade mix. But we've learned very quickly on D1 how to overcome the vendor issues. And by the end of April, we had the corrected equipment supplied to us. We took the downtime and primarily changed out few of the components that had to be corrected and then came on strong with the machine for the month of May and June on D1. So, D1's proven to be very successful. We're very pleased with where we are with the work we did.","And then D3, we talk on the call that we are \u2013 it's that basically 80% range in terms of 1,000 ton a day goal. And so, we moved up in productivity and efficiency and achieved our goals in terms of product trialing and also worked on cost. And so, D3 has proven to come on very quickly.","And then we also identified during the same time, and this is going into your question about the September outage. We had mentioned that we're going to install probably four dryer cans during the September outage. We realized that with the benefits of the capability to produce linerboard that we had additional dryers available. So rather than just take an outage and then install four dryers, we have the ability to install additional dryers and rearrange the last section on a machine to achieve this.","And so we're actually installing six new dryers, and we are rearranging some of the earlier section dryer cans, so that we have a full dedicated high-pressure section, which will ensure us that we have the ability to dry at 1,000 ton a day rate.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's very helpful. And the initial guidance on $60 million EBITDA, and I think the initial design capacity was 355,000 tons, are those two still unchanged?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We're still standing by the $60 million EBITDA, which \u2013 or $0.09 per share per quarter basis. We still have that as our target. And the 355,000 tons a year is based on the 1,000 ton a day productivity on the machine.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Great. And just one follow-up on containerboard. During the quarter, Pulp and Paper Week lowered Western liner prices $10 a ton. I'm curious if that's something that you saw in the market and if there's any impact to PCA in the second half of the year?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President-Corrugated Products","Anthony, this is Tom. I would say that it's very little impact. That was just basically a reflection of what has taken place in the past. So it was no big impact. And of course, we're not big net outside sellers on the West Coast anyway.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. I'll turn it over.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","The next question is from George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, everyone, good morning. Again, congratulations, Rick and Bob. Rick, really appreciate all the help over the years with the Investor Relations. I guess, the first question I had, could you give a bit more color, Mark, in terms of \u2013 or Tom, how you were able to get a richer mix through your efforts within the Boise system and then more broadly, within the legacy PKG system?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, let me start that off and then we'll turn it over to Tom. And if you think about the acquisition when we acquired Boise, there were few different parts of Boise. One of them is the Tharco business, which are really a stock-block business and the Hexacomb business which, at the time of the acquisition, were being run as separate entities within the Boise system. And so, we quickly identified the opportunities to integrate that entire system. I'm going to let Tom elaborate on it now.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President-Corrugated Products","Yeah, George. What we've basically been able to do is kind of break PCA's DNA, if you will, to Boise. And you've heard us over the years talk about the kind of mix we run, the hard to do, the things we want to get paid for, et cetera. And so, we've been working hard on both the Boise legacy box plants, the Hexacomb plants and the Tharco plants to be able to do that. There are some segments of the business that quite frankly don't make some sense, and there are others that need to be enhanced. So, we work very hard on doing that. I'm not going to go into great details, but that's essentially what we've done and what we'll continue to do.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Was there any operational effort that you brought to improving the mix as well? So, obviously, you always focus on the hard-to-do content in the market. Was there anything that operationally you did different that allowed for that without getting into specifics? Or was it really just \u2013 which markets you targeted?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think from an operational standpoint, certainly one of the benefits comes in freight, and that's getting the business to run in the right place. So, businesses move back and forth depending on best locations. And in addition, we did have \u2013 this was seasonally stronger in the second quarter than we actually thought. I'll just add that especially in the ag business in the Pacific Northwest, with the record heat they had out there, the crops came in earlier than they expected. So that was somewhat of a lift for us as well.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. I appreciate that. The next question I had, again, just on pace of activity early in the third quarter, can you give us your normal review of shipments and bookings? Are you seeing any signs that back-to-school or things like Halloween are trending better than expected, quicker than expected or being pushed out relative to what your customers have traditionally pulled at?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Our early third quarter trends, and we've only got about 10 or 11 days of July to base that on, but we're up about 2% again over the previous year, which of course was a larger number and a good year than previous year. So we're kind of tracking about the same.","Regarding some of these promotional trends and things like that, I think we saw a little bit of that a little earlier in the second quarter than we typically would. And \u2013 but I think overall, it's pretty stable.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Last one, housekeeping, I'll turn it over. Both the D3 ramp and the Boise synergies in total, where would we see those if you \u2013 where would we see those in the 2Q-to-2Q bridge table that you provided? Thanks very much and good luck in the quarter.","Richard B. West - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","George, this is Rick. In the 2Q-to-2Q bridge table, if you look at the components that we talked about, it's really in all of the areas. We had said in our \u2013 in fact, in our second quarter 2014 conference call that the packaging mills, we were looking for productivity, optimization and cost reduction. In our white paper mills, we were looking for just basic improvement. In our box plants, we said in the second quarter of 2014, we were looking at optimization of box plant operations and also lower corporate overhead.","And so, when you look at the 2Q-over-2Q, a lot of that is driven in each of the areas, as you can see, in the volume area, an optimization, and as we said on the call, productivity does two things for you, it's not just giving tons that makes it a cheaper mill cost per ton produced, and I think you can see that in our energy and chemical costs, somewhat in labor and benefit costs.","So in terms of the synergy realization, it's coming in each of those areas as part of the bridge. We don't specifically bring it up because there's other things we do.","Paul T. Stecko - Chairman","And George, this is Paul Stecko. One real simple fact that substantiates what Rick said, once we got DeRidder in a position to make the optimum grade, not optimum for DeRidder but optimum for our system. All three mills, Counce, Valdosta, and DeRidder had all-time production records. And that translates into very good cost also. So...","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And the mix, I would imagine.","Paul T. Stecko - Chairman","The fact that we produced those \u2013 that level of efficiency on cost and volume is a testament of the integration that got put into place once DeRidder could do its thing.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Well, congratulation on the quarter.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Chip.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good morning. Good morning. Congratulations, Rick. And Bob, good to be catching back up with you again.","Robert P. Mundy - enior Vice President-Elect and Chief Financial Officer-Elect","Thanks Chip.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","First question has to do with, I guess, D3. And you mentioned it added $0.06 in the quarter, so you annualize that, that's about two-thirds I think of the ultimate goal. And I was just wondering, I would imagine the other third should come from, I guess, about another 15% or so of production. And then, I would imagine the additional dryers would lower your cost there, especially as you make linerboard. Do you think those two activities, that is the additional dryers, plus the production, could actually allow that to exceed your original goal?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Where we are \u2013 we've committed to the fact that we know we're running the machine obviously better than we did at the beginning of 2Q. And as we ended up the quarter, we started 3Q. We're somewhere in that 90% of goal range. But more than that, we really worked on the quality and the cost input, the performance of the machine, it's running extremely well. And we fully expect that the financials will be there. The extra tons in terms of finishing up the incremental tons to get to the $1,000 (sic) [1,000 tons] (26:45) target, your overhead is already covered. And so, the contribution is very significant.","So, going from the $0.06 2Q earnings contribution to the goal of the $0.09 is what we're planning on and we see that as achievable. Again, the machine's performing very well and its cost structure is very competitive with the rest of our system.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Got you. I know it's early days, but do you see your CapEx edging down further next year, assuming no major obvious changes in your footprint since you won't be doing as much work at, say, DeRidder? And also, could you talk a little bit about downtime? I would imagine, I think you said in your comments, you're doing some things now that might have been done later. So, could that actually reduce the amount of downtime you take next year?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Regarding the capital level for next year, until we have a better chance to really assess what the opportunities are, we're going to say that our CapEx for 2016 would be in the same range of $275 million to $300 million, and that's providing that we have opportunities, now which \u2013 obviously we've identified various things that we're analyzing.","That being said, we plan on looking at a shutdown plan for next year. I mean, we saw the opportunity to move up some of these items that would have waited until next year, some boiler work, pulp mill work that will give us an immediate advantage in terms of operating efficiency at the mills coming out of September.","So, again, that does change how we look at the outage plan for 2016. Hopefully, all the work we're doing at DeRidder allows us to get DeRidder going forward into the normal shutdown mode that we see in our legacy system. Don't forget, I mean, this year hasn't been just about D3, the mill. We've worked on over 300 various capital projects at the mill that was part of that capital spend for the year. So we're very, very aggressively going after opportunities to capture the benefits at DeRidder.","Richard B. West - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And, Chip, let me just add to that. DeRidder is a huge mill. The good news is \u2013 we have some problems at DeRidder. And the good news is, when we overcome those problems, that's going to get more money to the bottom line. Mainly, there's opportunities at DeRidder that we can capitalize down the road that were not in the original synergy plan.","In other words, when we put our original synergy plan together to tell you what happens when you put the two companies together, immediately, what are the benefits? But after you do that, and we're pretty close to having that done, then you get into normal, continuous improvement-type activity. So, just because we'll be done with the $200 million in synergies, that does not mean \u2013 that was just an initial one-shot program, you get these synergies. But there'll be a long-term operations improvement program at DeRidder as exists in all of our mills, and we continue to want to take costs out of our system, and that will happen.","And that's kind of reflective also on D3. We're highly confident that this dryer change will get us everything we want from that machine. What's really significant about that, in our original design, we contemplated making a lot more medium than we are. And we complicated the drying situation on that machine when we're making probably two-thirds linerboard on that machine. So, not only will we get to the 1,000 tons a day, we'll get to it a much tougher grade to make than we originally contemplated.","Now, beyond that, looking down the road a year or two, I certainly feel that I'd be disappointed if we can't get more out of that machine in terms of lower cost and a little more productivity, but that's down the road a year or so until we get through with the first phase of this operation, and that's the point Mark made earlier. But I wanted to emphasize it.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Got you. And last quick one is, I know you guys being so largely integrated (31:23) the market, you mentioned that you've reduced your purchases. And I sit here and you think on the linerboard side, especially the virgin quality, whether it's recycled that's made at a virgin level or virgin itself, there's just basically no capacity coming on because we know Pratt doesn't really fit that bill. And yet, the market's growing. So, I'm just wondering even with you all backing off the market, are you having any difficulty getting virgin board out there, or is that not a problem?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President-Corrugated Products","Well, Chip, this is Tom. I'll just say this, number one is that's one of the reasons why we're doing D3 in terms of the linerboard because we internally need linerboard in our system. And our purchases, you know, I mean, were very high before. We did the acquisition. We did the D3 conversion mainly because we needed to supply ourselves.","And so, we're doing okay. We think we're definitely in a sweet spot, there's no question about that. And you're absolutely right, there is very little growth, if any, in terms of virgin capacity out there. And yet, there is still \u2013 that's the primary market. And there's a very large demand for that. And of course, as I think you've stated before, the outside market has shrunk dramatically. So, the integration in terms of demand, not necessarily with supply, but in terms of demand has gotten to the point where anybody looking at doing anything in terms of adding mill capacity, if you don't have it internally integrated, there is very few customers out there that are net buyers in the marketplace.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Next question, please.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you. One or two housekeeping, first off, can you give us an update on the EPS impact from outages as it rolls through the year?","Richard B. West - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, Mark. Just to give you what we've said previously, we had said, of course, it was $0.15 actual in the first quarter. In the second quarter, we had guided to $0.16, we were able to pick up $0.01 with lower cost at our I-Falls mill, so the second quarter was an actual of $0.15. As we go to the third quarter, we were looking at $0.09, but that's up to $0.11 in the third quarter, the DeRidder outage for 13 days is an extra $0.04 per share. But we were able to reduce the Jackson outage by $0.01 per share, so the net difference would be $0.02 lower in the third quarter.","And then in the fourth quarter, we had said $0.19, and it's up to $0.20 with that. So we're now at $0.61 of annual outage cost compared to $0.59. So a pickup of $0.04 from DeRidder, but a reduction of $0.02 with the I-Falls second quarter, and the Jackson third quarter.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then is that a number you kind of consider normal for a year, order of magnitude?","Richard B. West - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No. As we said previously in the second \u2013 in our first quarter call, you'd probably look at a normal year of about $0.55 a share, $0.56. It's premature because it depends upon the amount of work you would do. But considering the fact that we had the extended outage at DeRidder in the first quarter, it'd probably be more in line still with about $0.55 or $0.56.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Great. Now, you'd mentioned the West Coast liner, really no impact, that there were some, also, shifts in medium pricing. Does that likewise have minimal impact in terms of your corrugated pricing, et cetera?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President-Corrugated Products","Yeah, Mark. This is Tom. Yeah. That was \u2013 I mean, there is some impact. There is no question about it, but it's very, very small for us.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And then lastly, you did pick up the pace of share repurchase in the quarter. And how should we read that? Is that being opportunistic on stock price or is that just a function of where your financial strength is right now and you would intend to continue at that type of rate, pretty much regardless of share price in terms of repurchase activity?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Primarily, that was based on an opportunistic situation when the stock started dropping.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Terrific. Thank you. And thank you, Rick, for all your help over the years.","Richard B. West - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Mark.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, gentlemen, and congratulations again, Rick, and welcome, Bob.","Richard B. West - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","A couple of questions for you. First, let me start with, just kind of taking a step back, it's been a couple of years since you bought Boise and you've done a lot of work. And it sounds like you still have a little bit more on the synergy side. You're working through particularly on the corrugated side. As you kind of take a look at the businesses acquired, getting back into the \u2013 or getting into the papers business that you hadn't done much in the past with, how do you assess that as you look today? I mean, you've done some work. You've got what you wanted mostly done there. Is that still something that you view as a long-term fit within the organization or something you're still kind of taking a look at or how do you think about it?","Richard B. West - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Without getting too far ahead of ourselves, we're continuing to make operational improvements. The business does not require an inordinate amount of capital to take care. And so, it generates a lot of cash. And we stated this on prior calls, in spite of some of the markets pressures, it's a good cash generator and it doesn't take a lot of our attention right now in terms of resources. And so that being said, we're going to continue just running the business for the time being. And \u2013 but we will obviously assess all opportunities that come along in the future.","Paul T. Stecko - Chairman","And, Chris, just to amplify on that, this is Paul Stecko. It's only, our EBITDA in the white business is about 12% of our total EBITDA. And that number will decrease over time as, if we grow the brown business as we like. But that 12% or 13% of EBITDA doesn't require a lot of capital support. And we like that free cash and we like having the ability to do something with it. And so, the white business has performed in line with our expectations and maybe beat it a little bit because of the synergies.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. The second question I had was, as you look at \u2013 you mentioned inventory as being a little higher with freight logistics and different elements there and then timing of outages. Is there a way to estimate, A, are you at a level that you're comfortable with, you're happy with as you look through your corrugated operations? Is there a way to estimate how much that's going to add? Is that the logistics, the freight, some of the other problems that'll end up staying with you? Is that two, three, four days? How do you think about that?","Richard B. West - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Let me go back and \u2013 last year, when we were into the full first year of integration of the Boise legacy systems and giving us a West Coast presence of Pacific Northwest primarily, but a bigger West Coast presence.","And looking at how we supplied the system with tons, obviously, you're reaching out further on a transportation cost basis. And then with the transportation issues, with the trucking availability, trucking costs, rail availability, rail cost, we realized obviously it makes sense to reassess the overall inventory in our box plant system.","And so, where we had assumed we would run it obviously was not an ideal situation. And so, we talked about this in the last October's call that we intended to move our inventories up to take that into account. And then as we work through 1Q and 2Q, I think where we are today, we're feeling comfortable that this is a manageable inventory at the year-over-year higher level. That being said, it's all being determined by what happens with transportation availability and cost. But again, I think where we are in today's world, our inventory is around a manageable level and a necessary level for us to service our customers.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Good luck in the quarter.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Next question.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Thanks, couple of things. You've obviously talked a lot about optimization and productivity in the quarter since you did Boise. But as we think about D3 coming online, is it fair to assume that the re-optimization of the containerboard system that happens after D3 settles in is going to be similar order of magnitude opportunity of what you've already accomplished with D1?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","That's really speculative. We'll continue to focus and fine-tune on the great mix opportunities. And as Tom grows his business, it gives us that much more flexibility with how we supply the box plant's needs now. But truly, I'd only be speculating on anything regarding that question.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. So if we come back to the question of outside board purchases being down, last quarter, you said, I think, that D3 could help you eliminate 200,000 tons of outside purchases over time. Can you give us a better sense of what period of time that might be?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Well, we are not purchasing basically at commodity grade outside linerboard. And we continue, as we always have, to purchase small amounts of specialty linerboard such as white top grade. But when you think about \u2013 the machine itself truly allowed us to cease being dependent on the outside market for ground commodity-type linerboard grades. And so \u2013 and we've done for years and we've always gone out and taken advantage of what was available for the specialty type linerboard. Tom, do you want to add to that?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President-Corrugated Products","Probably just say also, I mean, it's provided us an opportunity in the lightweight arena that we didn't have before.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Exactly.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President-Corrugated Products","And that was an area where we purchased and we had a desire for a higher virgin content obviously. So these \u2013 the work we're doing on D3 is actually satisfying the demands that we have (43:04).","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","And Mark, to get to the bottom line, you mentioned the 200,000 ton a year number we gave you?","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Yeah.","Richard B. West - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","The actual number for last quarter, which is one-fourth of the year, was 56,000 tons. So if you multiply that by four, you can see if we continue at that rate, we'll see the 200,000 tons. And the reason is we're growing. So not only do you have to add the 200,000 tons of outside, you're going to add the tons we'll need (43:38) growth, and you know, our growth this year is up a couple of percent, then a couple of percent on a big number gives you a fair amount of tons to add to that total. So, we'll be well over the 200,000 ton target.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. That's what I was looking for. And just one last simple question, what's driving the decline you saw in label paper? Obviously, that's a business Boise has put a lot of effort into building?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Judy?","Judith M. Lassa - Senior Vice President-Paper","Yes, this is Judy. So a couple reasons, Q2 of last year, we were still selling discontinued pressure-sensitive grades out of I-Falls as a result of both of the closure. Also, the strong dollar is impacting our international sales, as well as kind of having a weaker demand globally. We've also had some mix changes domestically. So we really think this will improve as we ramp up those new products on W3. It's a pretty long transition time because they're very technical, very \u2013 but we've got a lot of things in the hopper right now.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Super. Thank you, Judy.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Richard B. West - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Looking at the balance sheet, you've really de-levered since the Boise acquisition. Can you talk about what the appetite is to potentially look for other transformative type of M&A opportunities for you?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","You know, again, historically, we've always looked at opportunities, we've always been conservative. We consider what the value of an acquisition would be? What the returns would be? How much you're going to pay? What's the multiples? But, yes, to your point, we're obviously \u2013 the balance sheet's in good condition. And so, if the right opportunity came along, as we've said over the years, we'd be evaluating it.","Richard B. West - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And I guess from a perspective, I just want to make it very clear because you raised an important point, we don't let the money burn a hole in our pocket. If we've got a lot of cash, that doesn't mean we're just going to go out and spend it. If we didn't have enough cash and it was a terrific M&A opportunity, we'd borrow the money. So, we look at an M&A not from a respect that we've got the money. We look at it strictly, is it a good thing to do? So, the fact that we have money, it's a consideration, but it is far from the main consideration.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That makes sense. And then in terms of smaller opportunities, you have been active in terms of increasing integration rate with box plant acquisitions. Can you talk about what the marketplace currently looks like in terms of opportunities to pick up box plant assets?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President-Corrugated Products","Alex, this is Tom. I would say that there are some opportunities. They're limited. Obviously, we were \u2013 we initially started this process quite some time ago, and a number of independents have been bought up over this time period that alludes to the fact there's very little outside purchases going on anymore domestically. So, they're not as abundant as they use to be, but there are some opportunities. And obviously, as Mark said, we're exploring any of them that make any sense to us.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And just last one from me, looking at your shipment number for the quarter, it looks like it's about 100 basis points better than where the industry is. Over the years, I think you've grown faster than that relative to the industry. And so, the question is, given the larger footprint, do you think it becomes more difficult for you to be able to really grow 3% above the market, which is where I think the business has been over the last decade?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Let me answer it this way. We plan on continuing to grow it in the manner that we've done over the last 15 years. And again, that's taking advantage of opportunities in terms of being mindful of the margins from the business. And looking at what that contribution is from each component of business you take.","So, but yes, I mean, the plan hasn't changed, the model hasn't changed. And so we certainly have the \u2013 the bigger footprint actually gives us more flexibility and more opportunity to go out and continue doing what we've done. So, that's our plan.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Wilde of BMO Capital Markets.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah, good morning and congratulations on a very good quarter. Mark, I just wondered thinking about D3, you're about 75%-25% kind of a liner-medium. What's the ultimate mix going to look like there?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","I think where we are right now, we're satisfying what Tom needs in his box plants. That being said, we have an enormous amount of flexibility on the machine because of the virgin capability on a machine making the high performance liner. But this 70%-30%, 75%-25% range that we're at is ideal for us right now, but reserving that condition as things change, we certainly have an enormous capability to move with whatever Tom needs.","Richard B. West - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, I might add this, Mark. Your question is hard to answer until you know what the demand situation is out there. But in an ideal world, what D3 should make would be above 75% liner and 25% medium. And the only reason medium fits in there is that it would supply only a very low cost freight on medium. So it's a lot cheaper to ship medium into the Metroplex in Dallas from DeRidder than it is from Tomahawk, Wisconsin or Filer City. So that's a big freight savings when you can do that.","And linerboard always wins over medium unless the freight penalty changed that equation. So, if the demand for liner gets higher, you might have to eat some freight. But again, in an ideal world, 75%-25% right now unless the marketplace changes.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. Okay. Tom Hassfurther, where is your integration level right now?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President-Corrugated Products","We're at 85%, Mark.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And you want to get that to north of 90% still, is that right?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President-Corrugated Products","Yeah. Yeah. We want to continue to get it up, yes.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","That's still our goal, Mark.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. All right. And then, the last question I had, Mark, and this isn't specific to PCA, but can you just address the issues of what would be required to convert uncoated white paper capacity over the linerboard? I mean, if we've got very little virgin capacity coming into the market, it seems like one of the things you could do is you can take an uncoated freesheet mill, where you've got a kraft mill, and you've maybe got big paper machines and look at a conversion there. Any thoughts on the difficulty of that?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'm going to answer that a couple different ways. First, we don't have any plans to convert anything. But also, we talked on the last few calls about the complexity of that. And then, again, and I've stated this over the number of years that you can convert anything to do anything, but again, at what cost and about what opportunity. DeRidder was a unique example because we have the virgin kraft fiber that we made available to the machine. And so, it not only, not only made sense at the time to convert it to the medium production as originally planned two years ago, but because we had the virgin kraft availability, it was that much more compelling for us.","But that being said, it takes a unique set of technical capability, a lot of what we did on the machine was our own in-house technical expertise. So, again, the degree of difficulty is great, the cost is great, and again, you have to weigh that with your opportunities. So, that's how I want to answer that.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right. That's helpful. Thanks very much. Good luck in the third quarter.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. Congrats on the quarter. Quick question, price mix was awash in 2Q, certainly illustrating you're well insulated due to your integration level. But pricing was a lot more choppy in 1Q. So what I'm trying to figure out on a quarter-to-quarter basis, what's changed and in your 3Q guidance, are you baking any slippage on export prices or the West Coast price cut?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's pretty flat actually, Philip. But, we did, of course, tell you that exports were up about $0.02. So that was a bit of a headwind for us. But other than that, we continue, as we talk about, to manage our mix and continue to proceed forward with that and start to transition some of this \u2013 continue to transition this Boise legacy business, (53:02) into kind of what PCA's model, little bit more like PCA model.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay. I guess it's that transitioning piece, right, because 1Q caught us by surprise in some of the volatilities on price. But, okay, that's helpful. And I guess a question for Judy. On the uncoated freesheet business, I know you took some downtime in 2Q. But with prices coming down sequentially in 3Q, do you expect margins getting back to that double-digit level next quarter? And just curious to get your thoughts on your outlook on uncoated freesheet prices now that the tariff should be starting to kick in in the back half of the year.","Judith M. Lassa - Senior Vice President-Paper","Philip, this is Judy. So, third quarter is a seasonally stronger quarter, so our expectation that that would still happen, that will help us. It usually has a typically a heavier mix to the office side of the business. And, of course, with no planned outages and no J1 turbine incident and our mills running better on costs and productivity, we would hope for that to improve.","As far as the tariff situation, the preliminary ruling, cut size imports to date are down about 33,000 tons through June with about 21,000 of that being in 2Q. But we really haven't seen any of the effects of that in the market yet. But as customer inventory decrease, we expect to see some impact. How much? We're not really sure at this time. That remains to be seen. The short answer there, it's really too early to tell what's going to happen.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Very helpful. And just one last one for me. Glad to see the synergy ramp up, back on track. Appreciate the color you provided earlier. If we take the first half run rate and (54:47) a slower 1Q ramp, seems like you'd be able to realize most of that $200 million synergy target this year. Can you kind of help frame what the opportunity is for 2015? And is there some opportunity for upside going forward?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Again, we've stated that the goal is $200 million of synergies. And we are quickly approaching that on a run rate basis. We've also mentioned in the past, we've got some discrete opportunities and the biggest opportunity that is looking at us right now is the International Falls turbine generator, which will come on line at the end of September. So, that's another example of how we get to the final run rate, $200 million goal in synergies.","But as Paul mentioned earlier also, synergies typically associated with bringing two companies together and then integrating the companies. And so the goal of getting the $200 million by the end of 2016, we see us finishing up the integration into next year. And obviously, we're well on our way to accomplishing the $200 million run rate goal. And that being said, after that, the opportunities are just to continue to be accretive for the company as we go forward, as we've done in the legacy business. But I don't want to speculate on anything else on synergies except that we've got \u2013 identified a number of discrete opportunities that we're very comfortable with.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Appreciate the color, Mark.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. Next question?","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Debbie.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","To the extent you can, can you just talk about your customer exposure? Kind of \u2013 I know this is very broad based, but which customers would you say in the corrugated market are really either outperforming or underperforming? And then your exposure to the e-commerce, I realize it's hard to kind of estimate, but what kind of growth are you seeing or expecting in that market?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","I'm going to start off and I'm going to hand it off to Tom. We're not going to get into specific customers. But across the board, we've seen growth in our system. Obviously, a little bit of weakness in the last few years with the West Coast drought. But other than that, I think again, it's across-the-board growth. Tom, do you want to add a little more color to that?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President-Corrugated Products","Yeah. Debbie, we have thousands and thousands of customers. So, it's you know...","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We have 30,000 customers.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. I know. I realize that. I thought just maybe more kind of housing-related versus e-commerce, like broader bucket.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think, if you look at some of the \u2013 if you just look at some of the industry trends, obviously, e-commerce has been strong and continues to grow. The housing market, depending, if you're in straight building materials, that's \u2013 you can just go on housing starts and kind of dictate what kind of demand you're going to have there.","I think remodeling and that sort of stuff has probably picked up just a little bit. Those are reasonably strong. But you can go through lots and lots of segments and come up with a lot of different answers here.","So I would just leave it at that and just say that on an overall basis, I mean, you know what the demand is doing for boxes and it's tracking a lot closer to GDP and certainly very close to the non-durable numbers. And I think that will continue to be the same going forward.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And just one final question. When DeRidder is fully ramped up, what would you expect your OCC virgin fiber mix to be?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","That's something that we consider proprietary. But again, we have the capability with the pulp mill right now to supply again the current ratio is between OCC and virgin kraft. Again, it's no different than what we're doing at Counce. So again, we've got a lot of flexibility there. But I don't want to get into the specific ratios of virgin versus recycled in the sheets.","Richard B. West - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. But an important aspect of that question, and I'll add to it, is that we also want to pursue \u2013 we're not only working on paper machines. We're also working on pulping capacity at DeRidder because if and when, and I think it's more a question when, OCC prices start to go up again, and if they go up a lot, we like the fiber flexibility of being able to put in more virgin and eliminate OCC in the facility and not be dependent on it totally. And so, pulp capacity to us, virgin pulp capacity is another very important part of what DeRidder brought us. And that's the same model that we use at Counce, same flexibility.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And, Rick, congratulations on the retirement.","Richard B. West - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you.","Mark W.

Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, guys.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Hey, George, go ahead.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","...make it a quick one. As we look at historically what you've done with share repurchase, you've always said that you would be opportunistic. In fact, that's how you framed the second quarter repurchase activity, and we were certainly happy to see it. Considering, though, that a lot of the operating issues in the first quarter were from things that are usually one-off, Packaging Corp. tends to run very, very well. 1Q wasn't as good of a quarter. Would you have wanted to buy back more stock in the quarter given that you had gotten an opportunity in the market driven by a one-off factor that was operational? Or did you really acquire the stock that you would have liked in 2Q? If you can frame it anyway you can, that'd be great. Thank you and good luck in the quarter again.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I'm going to let Paul get into that. That's a board matter, and we've discussed that in depth at the board level.","Paul T. Stecko - Chairman","Yeah. What we've said, George, is we're opportunistic. And if the stock is down and we think the reason is not a good reason. And my favorite comparison is every time for the past couple of years, there were problems in Greece, we got hit by it too, and we don't have any plans in Greece. We don't sell any paper to Greece. So, why are we being hit? And we used that opportunity to buy stock. So, we don't have a list of specific types of opportunities. You look at what's going on at the time and you make a decision.","And at times, we have bought stock just to buy some and keep up with our buying program, but we mix that with opportunities. So, we just don't sit around and wait for an opportunity that may or may not materialize. We have a plan to buy so much stock over some period of time, but we'll accelerate or de-accelerate that rate depending on what we see in the marketplace. So, that's kind of a long-winded answer to your question.","Paul T. Stecko - Chairman","All right, Paul. Again, thanks for the thoughts and you have a good quarter. Talk to you soon.","Mark W.

Your host today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chief Executive Officer of PCA. Upon conclusion of his narrative, there will be a Q&A session. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kowlzan, and please proceed when you are ready.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Good morning, and welcome to Packaging Corporation of America's second quarter earnings release conference call. I'm Mark Kowlzan, CEO of PCA, and with me on the call today is Paul Stecko, Executive Chairman of PCA; Tom Hassfurther, who runs our Corrugated business; and Rick West, PCA's Chief Financial Officer. Thanks for participating in this morning's call and after the presentation, we'll be glad to take any questions.","Yesterday, we reported second quarter net income of $64 million or $0.66 per share, which included a one-time after-tax noncash charge of $5 million or $0.05 per share for pension plan changes. Excluding this charge, earnings were a record $69 million or $0.71 per share. This compared to second quarter 2012 net income, excluding special items of $48 million or $0.49 per share. Net sales were a record $800 million, up 12% from the second quarter of 2012 net sales of $712 million. The $0.22 per share increase in net income, excluding special items, were driven by higher containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix of $0.27, higher corrugated products sales volume of $0.05. These items were partially offset by: higher costs for energy of $0.04; labor and fringe benefits, $0.03; and the timing of annual mill maintenance outages, $0.03. Excluding special items, net income for the first 6 months of 2013 was $130 million or $1.33 per share compared to net income for the first 6 months of 2012 of $88 million or $0.91 per share. Year-to-date net sales were $1.56 billion, up 12% from $1.38 billion in the first half of 2012.","We had an outstanding quarter in all aspects of our operations with record earnings driven by higher prices for containerboard and corrugated products and higher corrugated products volume. The annual outages at 3 of our mills went extremely well with very efficient start-ups and the mills set a new quarter record for tons produced per operating day. Earnings were higher than our second quarter guidance, driven by better than forecasted containerboard and corrugated products volume and price, and lower than forecasted cost.","Moving to the details of the operations: corrugated products shipments per work day were up 5.2%; and total shipments were up 6.8%; with one more work day in this year's second quarter. With our last box plant acquisition made in the first quarter of 2012, this is the first quarter where there was no volume contribution from new acquisitions.","Demand for both domestic and export containerboard remains strong. However, with higher containerboard consumption in a number box plants and with the 3 mills being down during the quarter for their annual maintenance outages, we reduced our outside containerboard shipments by 9,000 tons compared to last year's second quarter. This allows us to end the quarter with our containerboard inventories at a more manageable level, about 12,000 below at the end of this year's first quarter when we built some inventory for our second quarter planned outages. Our mills will need to continue to run well in the third quarter, however, by considering our inventory level and expected demand.","Moving to mill production and performance. Our mills ran extremely well, producing 629,000 tons of containerboard despite reduced production of about 30,000 tons per mill annual maintenance outages at our 3 largest mills. This is 7,000 tons more annual maintenance downtime than last year's second quarter.","In April, we had the No. 1 paper machine down at our Counce, Tennessee linerboard mill for 7 days, reducing production by 11,000 tons. In April, we also had the larger No. 4 paper machine down at our Tomahawk, Wisconsin medium mill, down for 5 days. And also, the No. 2 paper machine at that mill was down for 4 days with total production losses of 7,000 tons.","In May, our Valdosta, Georgia linerboard mill was down for 8 days, reducing production by 12,000 tons.","Each of the mills started up and ran very well after their outages. And as I said earlier, the mills set a new quarter -- second quarter productivity record for total tons produced per operating day. For the quarter, based on days available to operate after taking out scheduled downtime days, the mills ran at just over 100% of their capacity. The timing and taking more annual maintenance downtime in the second quarter this year reduced our earnings by about $0.03 per share compared to last year's second quarter. We have no more annual leverage scheduled in the third quarter so our mills will have an opportunity to produce more tons. Our remaining 2013 annual no-maintenance outage is in October at our Filer City, Michigan medium mill, which will be a 5-day outage.","Looking at prices and mix. Prices were higher for both containerboard and corrugated products, improving earnings by $0.27 per share compared to last year's second quarter. Our corrugated products price increases went in as planned and as of today, have been essentially completed. Export prices have also increased compared to both last year's second quarter and the first quarter of this year, as prices have moved up appreciably in all of our markets.","With regards to cost, energy cost were up $0.04 per share compared to last year's second quarter, driven by increased prices pay for purchased fuels. Natural gas prices increased $1.35 per square Btu, and coal prices were up about $0.55 in square Btu compared to prices paid last year during the second quarter.","In addition, labor and fringe benefit cost increased $0.03 per share, transportation cost increased $0.01 per share and we did see some real -- as we did see some railcar shortages. And we also had a heavier mix of longer haul destinations.","Recycled fiber costs were lower than last year's second quarter, improving our earnings by about $0.01 per share as industry published prices for recycled fiber, excluding the delivery cost, were down about $15 per ton in the second quarter compared to the second quarter of last year. This benefit was offset by a slightly higher wood cost with reduced earnings by $0.01 per share. Our effective tax rate was lower than last year's second quarter from the settlement of certain tax matters, which improved our earnings by about $0.01 per share.","I'm now going to turn it over to Rick West, our CFO, who will give you an update on our financial position.","Richard B. West","Thank you, Mark. In the second quarter, PCA generated cash from operations of $187 million. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $54 million. We paid our quarterly common stock dividend of approximately $31 million. Cash tax payments of $6 million were made and fuel credits of $66 million were used to offset federal taxes. We currently have estimated remaining fuel tax credits of $4 million, which will be used to partially offset tax payments in the third quarter. However, the final amount of the available fuel tax credits and the final cash tax rate is contingent upon the conclusion of the IRS audit currently underway.","We ended the quarter with $370 million of cash on hand, up $102 million from the end of the first quarter. Our total long-term debt outstanding at the end of the quarter, excluding capital leases, was $786 million. As of June 30, 2013, our diluted shares outstanding were 97.7 million shares. As Mark mentioned earlier, during the second quarter, PCA recorded a one-time noncash charge of $5 million, which was related to a change in our hourly pension plan. We recently negotiated an agreement involving 25 of PCA's corrugated plants who will transition from a defined-benefit pension plan to a defined contribution 401(k) plan. The pension charge is based on accounting guidance which requires us to accelerate the recognition of prior service pension cost for employees affected by this change.","With that, I will turn it back over to Mark.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Thank you, Rick. Before discussing the third quarter, I want to mention that based on our strong cash flow and cash position, we are accelerating about $25 million of higher return capital projects from 2014 into the second half of 2013. These projects are all on our corrugated products plants where additional capacity is needed to support anticipated growth.","Now moving ahead to the third quarter. We expect higher corrugated products prices, higher sales volume and with no planned annual outages, increased mill production and lower mill operating cost. We also expect higher purchase electricity cost with summer pricing, higher amortization of annual outage repair cost and a higher tax rate. Considering these items, we expect third quarter earnings to be about $0.88 a share.","With that, we'll be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you, some of the statements we've made on the call constitutes forward-looking statements. The statements are based on current estimates, expectations and predictions of the company and involve risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC. The actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.","With that, operator, we'd like to open the call for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from George Staphos, of Bank of America Securities.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess first off, Paul, congratulations to you on the recent announcements and I guess best of luck, everyone in their future roles at PCA. My first question would be, can you comment at all on how early third quarter bookings and billings have been? And can you comment at all on the June box containerboard data, which came out whether the data was more or less in line with your expectations or if there was any variance? And I have a couple of company-specific questions.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Regarding bookings and billings, for the first 7 days, our bookings are up about 18%, billings are up about 11%. And again, we're off to a good start but also take into account the fact that the way the Fourth of July fell this year, on Thursday, Friday, in some box plants, was an operating day. So even though it was not included as an official day, it wasn't caught up that day. So the numbers are skewed somewhat. But we are off to a strong start, but we do expect those numbers to temper down over the rest of the month. And then regarding the FDA numbers this morning, the one comment I do want to make, if you look at PCA, we came out of our second quarter and we have the annual shutdowns at the 3 of the mills, we needed to run -- we needed to build some inventory. But we are actually, for the month of June, we've built some inventory. So our PCA number, we were up 5,000 tons, but we were still too low after the outages. And so for the quarter, we were still down 12,000 tons. So on an industry basis, if you think about the month of June and what the FDA numbers were reported, you're talking about a 30-day mill month as opposed to a 20-day box plant month. And again, that's a 10-day differential. Normally, you'll see a 9-day differential. So if you're talking about 100,000-ton mill contribution from this particular June, typically, you wouldn't see. So with that, I really don't have a lot to add to the FDA numbers, except again, volume has been strong in our case and the inventories have trended at the historically low levels.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. I appreciate that. One question made more specifically to PCA, and you alluded to this on your comments, you are accelerating some projects to add some high return -- or accelerate some higher return -- projects in the box plants over the next 12 months into this year. If we had it stack rank, what investors see is the most likely sources of return improvement in PCA from here over the next couple of years, would it be coming from the market development as you see it in the economy? Would it be coming from the capital deployment as you just mentioned for operations? Or would it come from value return to shareholders? How would you stack rank the most likely sources of improvement on return to the shareholder from here, from those 3 resources?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Well, again, if you think about what our strategy has been for the last few years, we have a goal of getting our integration level up to the 91% level. And continuing to deploy capital, especially in the box plants, to help in that direction which would have been very successful. With that in mind, if you think about where we are, year-to-date, we're sitting at about 87% integration, but from a return point of view, again, I think the capital -- and we are spending in the box plant -- continues to give us extremely high return opportunities and as you're seeing that in the volume. Tom, do you want to add anything else in the capital. We don't really talk about it a lot, but your side of the business has been deploying well with good small pieces that have been returning the big volume growth.","Thomas A. Hassfurther","Yes, Mark, I would just that, yes, that we're really a customer-driven company, a revenue-driven company. And so we will deploy that cash where that driver can accelerate our earnings. With that said, I think we've also taken all the above approach and we've developed a lot of flexibility and we're pretty opportunistic about where we want to deploy that cash. But right now, we have some opportunities in the box plants, as Mark alluded to, that have some good returns and we're accelerating those solely based on the fact that we have some very good customer opportunities and they're coming to us and we're taking advantage of those opportunities.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Last one...","Mark W. Kowlzan","You're out of questions. You have exceeded your limit on the first call. We're going to have to cut you off and move on. But just to summarize, that was the last, it was a good question. If I rank the first one, if we had to pick one -- I think Mark said, increasing our integration level will be our greatest source of value creation for shareholders. And so if you don't mind, we'll circle back to you later for other questions. We have -- 15 analysts now that cover us and we want to give everybody an opportunity. So we're going to have to cut you off, George. No malice intended.","Operator","Our next question is from Anthony Pettinari of Citi.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Mark, you referenced improvements and some capacity addition opportunities on the box plants side. And given that you're growing faster than the industry and your mills are running full out or near full out, I'm wondering would you consider capacity expansion on the mill side over the next 1 to 2 years? How should we think about your mill footprint in terms of capacity as you continue to grow kind of faster than the industry?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Well, just again, the #1 priority continues to be the integration level. We've spoken over the last year that we continue to have the tons available that come out of the outside sales, both to the export and the domestic sales side of the equation. So with the pre-capacity that we currently have on the mills and the efficiency with which we're running, and then with the opportunity to move tons of rationalized tons longer-term out of those export domestic markets, the mill acquisition, mill incremental capacity is a lesser concern at this point, as opposed to the integration itself.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just a very quick follow-up. You referenced railcar shortages and maybe some higher transportation costs, and that's some things that other producers have talked about. Is this a problem that's getting worse as you go into the third quarter or is it isolated to a specific region? Or is there any kind of color you can give us about what the pressure is in terms of transportation costs?","Mark W. Kowlzan","It was a combination of -- we went to the outages in the spring. We obviously had opportunities and issues combined with how to take care of the box plants during that period of time and get the tons moved to the right places from the remaining mills that we're running. And again, we had some spring issues, again, just with the normal seasonality with regards to our rails and trucking. And then just again, just the nature of where we are with the trucking industry. And so that being said, again, the fact that we have compressed our annual shutdowns into the April, May period probably created the most -- the biggest factor in that transportation dilemma.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Weintraub of Buckingham Research.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","With more and more cash flow that you're generating, you have the enviable problem of finding a home for it, and I know you've increased your dividend a lot in the recent past. I don't think you were too active on the share repurchase during the quarter, if you could confirm that? And maybe just help us understand, I realized there's the 25-minute incremental that you're pulling forward, but you still seem to have a lot of additional cash beyond homes that have been identified for it. Can you help us on what you're thinking about at this stage?","Richard B. West","Yes. Again, as we've said in the past, if you think about the use of cash being dividend, share buybacks, CapEx, Paul and I speak regularly about this and we're -- in past years, we've been opportunistic in buying shares back, but it was rather hard to justify these past 6 months buying shares when the market was performing the way it performed. That being said, I'm going to have Paul make some comments as we've done in the last few quarters because this is typically a board matter and we've discussed this at every board meeting. But in regards to the uses of cash besides the $25 million, into the third quarter we already have plans to make a $30 million pension plan contribution. And also our federal taxes, we're looking at $31 million of taxes in the third quarter. So again, the benefits of the black liquor credits essentially have run out. We only have $4 million left on those credits going into the third quarter. So again, we have roughly $51 million of incremental cash besides that capital. But, Paul, do you want to make a comment regarding that?","Paul T. Stecko","Yes. Well, you know what, Mark, you're right. We're going to continue, we're going to have cash. If things keep going the way they are, this is not a forecast, but we should have a strong cash flow generation in the second half, which, in your terms, exacerbates our problem a little bit. What do we do with it? We've had a strategy long term that we want to buy back shares, that's right up high of the things we do. We thought maybe what the Fed is talking about tightening up are not easy. Tightening up on the bond buying up, buying back as much as the market mix. Correct. The market is not corrected so we missed it again. In other words, if we had to do it over again, I wish we had bought shares back during the quarter, we didn't. On the other hand, the stock kept going up so I hate to root for the stock to go down just because we want to buy shares. So I'm kind of in a dilemma. I win in both ways, or lose both ways, however you want to look at it. We did increase the dividend. We thought that made a lot of sense and we increased it appreciably to get rid of some cash. We had a strong quarter and we're back in the dilemma again. We've got more cash than we need. We really have 2 things that we can look at: share buyback and share -- and dividend increases. And it's a moving target. We're kind of hoping that something happens that may make the decision easier, but in the end, we're eventually going to have to buy back more shares or increase the dividend and we'll probably do some of each. And when and how much, will depend on a lot of things and I'm not prepared, including board approval, so I'm not prepared to go much further than that other than we know the situation, we know we have a lot of cash, we know we've got to do something with it. We haven't quite figured it out yet. That's not the best answer in the world, but that's the truth.","Operator","Our next question is from Chip Dillon of Vertical Research Partners.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","First question is, you guys pointed out a $0.27 improvement from price and mix. And just looking at the mill production, that would suggest $60 a ton. And I know a lot of that has to be the mix side of it with your forward integration strategy. But could you give us an idea on how much of the price increase you actually realized in the quarter and how much we would expect to see in the third?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Yes, let me take this one. We don't give the exact numbers in that regard. We view that as a company confidential information. However, as Mark said on the call, as of roughly today, we're done with the increase. And we have achieved a full passthrough. Now we've got no, obviously, none of the increase in the box plants last April because our price increase began May 1. So we're going -- when you throw it all together, we're going have to realize this is both the mill containerboard increase, about 40% of the total in the second quarter and the other 60% in the third quarter. And that's the best way that I can describe it. So if you can figure out, which I know you're capable of, what the total price increase is and how many times we produce, we've got about 40% in the second quarter and we'll get the other 60% in the third quarter. And that's what I'd given into specific dollar amount of increases.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","And second question is, you mentioned you're -- you have a strong beginning to July. And one thing we noticed this morning is in the last couple of years, it seems like the box shipments, at least when you look at year-over-year and even in absolute terms, seem to be tilted more towards the beginning of a quarter and tend to fall off at the end of the quarter and we certainly saw that in June. But we've also seen it March and December and going back to September and June of last year. And I didn't know if something had really changed in the last couple of years that would explain that. And is that good or not good for the industry?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Again, if you just talk about PCA, our numbers are basically flat. If you look at the beginning of the month, the beginning of the quarter, we've been seeing a consistent run rates throughout the quarter. What is interesting about this July, July has started out stronger. Normally, the Fourth of July week holiday followed by the second week is typically a big vacation. Things are slow, but we've seen a good strong start this year. So again, we're strong but again, flat historically, through the latest quarters.","Richard B. West","Yes, just to amplify on it. If you looked over our monthly box shipments, April, May and June, they're all pretty much the same, there wasn't a lot of volatility month-to-month. So pretty constant. It's usually more volatile than this. And beginning of the month, to end of the month, there's not been a lot of volatility there and what you've said, we have it seeing time to time, historically, but not in the past quarter.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Got you. I know we're in a time constraint, could you just talk real quickly about what you're accelerating in CapEx wise into this year? How much of the dollars and what shall we expect in terms of the box plant improvement?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Well, Tom, why don't you comment about some of the projects you're looking at in terms of just the opportunities.","Thomas A. Hassfurther","This is Tom. We're going to accelerate about $25 million into 2013. Now, $5 million, it really doesn't have any real return in terms of income, but $5 million on infrastructure, which we just need to do and we might as well get that done now. $20 million is spread out in a lot of different projects and a lot of different plants, and again, as it relates to the previous discussion that we had regarding our customers and their demand and opportunities they present. And so that's where those are geared towards and the it's a handful of projects really spread out across the country.","Operator","Next question is from Mark Connelly of CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Just 2 things: You generated a lot more cash than we expected you do this quarter, I wonder if you could tell us if there's something different going on in working capital or somewhere nearby? And secondly, do you have a view on fiber cost in the second half and whether they're going to be affected much by the volatility you're seeing in lumber prices?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Rick, why don't you talk about cash first, then I'll talk about fiber.","Richard B. West","I really didn't see anything that abnormal in the cash flow or the cash we expected. We were targeting a level of cash generation at the level we've set. Our working capital did not change significantly from the first to the second quarter. So Mark, there was really nothing unusual there. We may -- we do have some larger cash payments in the third quarter as Mark mentioned earlier, but it's really nothing unusual.","Mark W. Kowlzan","And regarding fiber, we're seeing basically flat trends currently on virgin fiber plan hardwood costs. We have few periods with wet weather that costs some momentary increases in southern states. But again, as we go into the middle of summer right now, earning's flat with the wood-based fibers. A little bit of ups, increase on recycle we're seeing around the country, but nothing dramatic.","Operator","Our next question is from Phil Gresh of JP Morgan.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just on the box plant side. You mentioned that this is the first quarter you didn't any acquisition impact on the box volume, so I'm just kind of curious how you're thinking about the pipeline for any additional box plant opportunities or whether the acceleration on the CapEx side of things means you're going to be more internally focused in the second half?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Well, again, if you think about it, I know Tom is constantly evaluating opportunities. And Tom, why don't you add a little color to that?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","Well, Phil, I would say that as we said before, we are always looking at potential acquisition opportunities. We do have a high threshold for what they have to meet in order to make the acquisition. Of course, the quality, great quality and sustainable customer base, the quality management team and accretive earnings. So there are a lot of factors that have to be met. It's got to be of side that makes sense to us as well, quite frankly. But we're still looking out and we're exploring them. We have some opportunities that we're certainly looking at right now, and that's certainly an area that we will continue to deploy our capital.","Mark W. Kowlzan","And I guess -- and I'm going to have to add to that, all things being equal, an internal investment will produce a better return than an acquisition because if you just put a piece of equipment in the box plant, all of the overheads already been absorbed in that box plant. The only thing you're adding is a bit of a variable labor, a little bit of energy. So the margin on some of the things that we're doing and some of the things we've done in our internal investment program, produced very, very good returns. And we've had a good list of projects to look at. Tom and Mark have gone through them, they've picked the best of the best and said, \"Hey, we need to accelerate these, these returns are that good. And that doesn't mean you don't keep looking for acquisitions, but an internal project, if it's a good one, because in the overhead absorption benefit, we'll beat an acquisition.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then just to the extent that mix has been helped, as you look at the numbers year-over-year, how much of that is just kind of driven by using more of that board internally and these initiatives that you think you had versus some other kind of mix-related factor that you you've been going after?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Yes, some of the mix improvement is a result of that, Phil, as you mentioned. There's no question about that. We're going to deploy our paper where we have the best returns, there's no question about that. But in addition, I think it's representative of quality of the account base we have. They put a very high demanded on us, they have value. And as a result of that, we expect to get paid for that. So I think it's a combination of all the above. I think in addition, the improvement in the pricing also as a result of containerboard increase on the mill side, which did go into effect starting in April. So we got some benefit from that as well.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Sure, Okay. And then Rick, did you intend the last quarter that the maintenance tailwind from Q2 to 3Q, I believe, would be $0.06 a share and obviously, you guys had a strong performance this quarter. So is that delta still the same or does that change the delta?","Richard B. West","I think that the delta is essentially the same. It's going to be somewhere between 2Q to 3Q after you net out the increase in repair job, amortization of an improvement from $0.06 to $0.08 per share.","Operator","Our next questions is from Mark Wilde of Deutsche Bank.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I have just 2 questions. One, Paul, could you just talk about the topic of the potential special dividend as opposed to just an ordinary dividend? And then Tom Hassfurther, are you benefiting at all in the box business from just the consolidation that's taken place among the bigger players and maybe customers wanting to add suppliers, additional suppliers?","Paul T. Stecko","On the dividend, we've never done a special dividend and I really can't comment on that, more than that because then people read speculation into that and I don't want speculation to occur when I really don't have anything to say on the subject. So we've never done one before and I will leave it at. And Tom,you want to take the second part of that?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","Yes, Mark, I would say that I say we gained for many reasons, not primarily at all because of consolidation. I think more so because of our existing customer base. The fact that we've been able to align with some customers who have been able to grow through this period where the box business has been relatively flat. I think we've proven to our customers that we provide the best value and that's benefited us greatly.","Operator","Our next question is from Alex Ovshey of Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","If you look at the consensus forecast for the U.S. economy, there is hope that we see a pickup in the second half of this year and then into '14. And as you look at your book of business and talk to your customers, do you see a potential pickup in your business in the back half of this year versus the first half?","Richard B. West","I don't really have an answer to that, that's just speculative. Yes, we're not seeing anything in the market that says one thing or the other. Our business has been stuck in a rut pretty constant. The good news is it's the high earnings so we're so we're not complaining about it. But as I said early, we've been pretty consistent. We've not seen any change. We've heard, as you've heard and report up, so that if the feds change, it's policy. It may have an effect on the economy, et cetera, et cetera. So we're kind of like you, we're waiting to see what happens, but we don't know what's going to happen. But if it stays where it is, we'll be pretty happy. If it gets better, we'll be happier. So that's about all we get out on that. We really don't' know where the economy is going.","Mark W. Kowlzan","I would just ask in addition say in addition, Paul, our customers, like ourselves, were hopeful and optimistic.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. Let me ask you a question on...","Mark W. Kowlzan","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is from Scott Gaffner of Barclays.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Good morning.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Next question?","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","My first question is really a clarification around the capital spending.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Operator, is there any more questions in the queue?","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Can you hear me?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Operator?","Operator","Yes. We're on. Can you hear Scott Gaffner?","Mark W. Kowlzan","We've lost the call.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Can you hear me?","Operator","Yes, I can hear you. I believe something happened to their line.","[Technical Difficulty]","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Now we're back on. First question is really just a clarification around capital spending. I think on the first quarter you mentioned $120 million of CapEx. And then $50 million for either some box plant acquisitions or some strategic investment. Should we think about the acceleration of the $25 million from 2014 and add it to that number, meaning, $195 million in total now versus the $170 million, or how should we think about that?","Richard B. West","Yes. If you look at it, originally, we had $180 million of planned normal capital spending for the mills and box plants. We also had an additional $10 million that we had planned on this year for the Boiler MACT spending, so total of $190 million. But again, for the $180 million plus, the $25 million, that will be the total CapEx between the mills and box plants. And so again, about $205 million of normal plus the $10 million of the Boiler MACT.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then just around the capabilities that you're actually adding to the box plant, are these customers specific capabilities, meaning, are you coming up with ways to hold customers accountable for the investments that you're making? Or are these more broad investments that you can utilize to serve broad customer base?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","Scott, this is Tom. They are driven primarily by what in essence is customer demands that we don't have the capacity for. So we obviously will be able to fill the capacity of customer demands that we have existing and obviously have some potential to handle some additional demand.","Operator","Our next question is from Philip Ng of Jefferies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","A quick question. I mean, from a growth standpoint, your boxing business has obviously outpaced the market pretty nicely. I think it's around mid-single-digit rate for the last few years. Is the $75 million type of investment the new run rate going forward to sustain that growth rate going forward?","Richard B. West","You can say that. We'll take advantage of opportunities. I think Tom said that's very important. Where we see demand opportunities and growth opportunities based on our customer activity, we'll continue to deploy capitals for that growth needs. So the dynamic manner, we will be very flexible in how we deploy capital into the box plants. Again, it's a very, very dynamic process. And CapEx will slow down as we get towards the 90% -- not mid-90% to 93%, 94% integration level. As we approach that obviously, our need for additional box plant capacity will diminish unless we add more milk capacity or unless we expand our mills and then you're in the game, the same cycle, because our strategy revolves very strongly about -- around high integration level. So it's dynamic, you would expect it to slow down. And then, it could pick up again, depending on what we do on the mill side of the business.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got you. And that's actually a great seg-way. So on the mill side, do you guys have a lot of projects that are still available that you can easily add some capacity down the road or would you actually have to step up spending pretty meaningfully to get that incremental capacity?","Richard B. West","We said this before. It's all related to the amount of capital you want to spend. So capital per ton of capacity. And so you can add capacity virtually to most mills. It's just how much -- is it going to cost and how much are you willing to spend? How valuable is that incremental fund? Yes, another way you can increase capacity at percent, 2% a year. For not a lot of capital. But if you want a big pop in capacity, that cost, that's a big pop in capital. And so yes, you just have to determine that you go through this, what's the best way to do it. Maybe accelerate creeping a little bit, maybe do a big mill expansion, maybe make an acquisition. That will depend on the factors in play at the time.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got you. Just probably still too early to call that.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Yes, again, as we've said, until we get that 91% integration level in the low 90s, and then understand what our balance is going to be for outside sales with remaining funds, we're not making any plans for any large mill expansions.","Just to add to that. As you've said,we've been -- our demand is -- and our growth has been, I think, very good the last 3 years since we embarked on this project, but we're only halfway there. This is an ambitious project to get from 80% integration to the mid-90s. It's not something you do quickly because every piece of business we expand, we don't want tons per tonnage sake. We want box business that comes from customers who appreciate and pay for the value we provide. And so we're only looking for good business to fill up our system, not business in general. And that makes this objective even tougher. But we are on page. I think we're doing about as we expected and we're going to finish this before we move on to something else.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's really helpful. And just switching gears a little bit, just to broader emerging markets and timings like Brazil, China, Middle East, seem to have slowed a little bit. I know you guys don't export too much abroad, but have you seen your export business slow down a little bit on that?","Mark W. Kowlzan","We haven't seen this really slowdown, but again, during the second quarter we intentionally decreased our outside sales. In particular, some of the export tons to make sure that we took care of our own internal box plant. But Tom, if you think about last year into this year, we're probably the last guys to answer that question quite frankly, just because of the position we've taken in the export market. We cannot handle the demand we have right now and we have shrunk our supply base to the export market as it is. So all I can tell you is what we see right now have no idea what somebody who's really large in the export market and participates in all the markets around the world, what they see. In addition, I would just add that as Mark made mention in his comments, the price has risen significantly or certainly appreciably in the export market as well, at least the one's we're involved in.","Operator","Our next question is from Al Kabili of Macquarie.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Just 2 questions. Mark, first is just if you could help us on the box plant investment. Just help us frame what that means for your capacity this year? How much that boosts your capacity this year or how does that help your integration rate?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Well, if you look at year-to-date, we are sitting at an average of about 87% integration. And we believe in what we're forecasting internally is that the integration level will remain about 87% due to the remainder of the year in that area. So as far as for a full year average.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","That's really helpful. And is this investment related more to improving throughput, or some of this is just increasing your capabilities that's going to help with the mix component of your business?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Both. And just as Paul said back on the CapEx, we had a program where we spent $80 million to $100 million over the last couple of years to increase our integration level. This is only $25 million of capital. So you're talking about a couple of percent increase in integration level at most year. So this is not a big, big project, don't misunderstand that. We simply accelerate it about $25 million from last year to this year, and it's all equipment. It's a piece of equipment that we're out of capacity on. It's a piece of equipment that we need because we got a new piece of business specific to a customer that we could use in other places. And as Tom mentioned, about $5 million is just for infrastructure improvement. When you're running box plants, some of them, as far as we are, you've got to make sure the infrastructure is still able to support it. If it means that another track top or an improvement in -- so we can get more input through the whole plant, et cetera, et cetera. But again, it's only $20 million for equipment, probably in 7 or 8 plants, and it's going to -- on the margin, increase our integration level a couple of percent but it's not going to increase to 10% because of the amount -- we're only spending $20 million in capital, it's not that much money, but the returns are all very good.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Okay. And that's $20 million on top of the $50 million? So $70 million?","Richard B. West","Yes. And we put that in really on top of the $50 million because we'll do that and we'll make an acquisition. And that's the plan for this year. As Tom said, we're still working on the pipeline. That number could change too if a really good acquisition came up, but we've got no comments on that at this point.","Operator","The next question is a follow-up from George Staphos, Bank of America Securities.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My third question, only question here, is this: If we look at the level of operating profit relative to revenue and subtract once on the other, you get cost both this quarter and the year-ago quarter. Cost went up about $50 million some-odd, yet production declined for all the maintenance outage reasons. As you think about, maybe the question more for Tom, as I listened to what your number is kind of the cost factors in the quarter, would much of that increase in cost be a function of mix, i.e., as you've picked up business, you've picked up more profitable business but business that in turn, requires you to add more value to the profit before you sell it to the customer. What would drive that increasing cost relatively lower production year-on-year that you saw in quarter?","Paul T. Stecko","I'll take it. This is Paul. Now, let's not relate it to that. We've told you where the cost items that went up. Obviously, energy prices are up. Coal, gas, labor and fringes are up. Our hard incentive compensation payments will be up. If we continue with this rate, we'll make appreciably more earnings than we did last year and our bonus plan is a function of our profitability. The more profitable we are, the higher bonuses we can play until our labor and benefits are up, but there's nothing related to the mix on that. That is the short answer to your question.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. I'll follow-up offline because the numbers on a per share basis don't add up quite to the overall level of cost increase. But in any event, good quarter and luck on the third quarter.","Richard B. West","Yes. Let me comment on that. We don't understand the intricacies of every analyst model, so when you throw a model question out on us, we don't necessarily agree with what you're saying, not because we don't believe it, we just don't understand your model. So it's hard to respond to questions like that. Unless we do it offline and you tell us what your model means and we can respond to that as long as it's publicly available information.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Sure. I was just referring to what you published in terms of revenue and operating profit.","Operator","A follow-up from Chip Dillon of Vertical Research Partners.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Just a quick one, for Rick. On the black liquor credits, you mentioned there's just a little bit left and could you just give us a range of what the possible outcomes would be based on the Filer City audit? Could there be more or could there be -- where it would be reversed some of these credits?","Richard B. West","Jeff, as far as anymore, no. We have recorded what we expect what we will get and we have the $4 million remaining. And if you look in our 10-K, it does layout how much we have built in, in the event that it does -- if there's a lot of which we do not believe that will be the case. And as we've said last quarter, we believe the worst case would be $120 million payback if no credits were allowed. And we don't anticipate that.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Got you. And when do you think this gets resolved? Any update on that?","Richard B. West","From our standpoint, we are still hopeful that it will be resolved by the end of the year.","Operator","I have a follow-up from Al Kabili from Macquarie.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Just a quick one for you, Rick, on pension. With the changes to the plan, any thoughts on how that influences the pension expense?","Richard B. West","It doesn't really influence the pension expense that much. I did mention on a voluntary pension contribution that we're making irrespective of the change in the third quarter, but it does not impact the pension expense.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Okay. Thanks for that clarification. And with the black liquor $4 million left, should we just be assuming your cash tax rate goes close to your 36% book tax rate. How should we be thinking about it or is there's some depreciation items that could change that?","Richard B. West","There are some differences between tax depreciation and book depreciation, as well as some credits that are available under the normal course. I would say our cash tax rate reverting back to about 32%, probably about 28%, on third quarter a little over 32%.","Operator","I see there are no more questions. Do you have any closing remarks?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Thanks, everybody, for joining us today, and we look forward to seeing you on the next call on October. Have a good day.

Your host today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chief Executive Officer of PCA. Upon conclusion of his narrative, there will be a Q&A session. I will now turn the conference call over to Mr. Kowlzan, and please proceed when you are ready.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Good morning, and welcome to Packaging Corporation of America's Fourth Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. I'm Mark Kowlzan, CEO of PCA, and with me on the call today is Paul Stecko, Executive Chairman of PCA; Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs our Corrugated business; and Rick West, PCA's Chief Financial Officer. Thanks for participating in this morning's call and after the presentation, we'll be glad to take any questions.","This morning, we reported fourth quarter 2012 net income of $61 million or $0.63 per share. The reported results included net income of $3 million or $0.03 per share from state income tax adjustments related to cellulosic biofuel tax credits and after tax charges of $1 million, or $0.01 per share from plant closures. Excluding these items, net income was $59 million, or $0.61 per share, compared to the fourth quarter of 2011 net income of $39 million or $0.40 per share. The $0.21 per share increase in earnings, excluding these special items, were driven by higher containerboard and corrugated products price and mix of $0.12; higher volume, $0.09, and lower costs for recycled fiber, $0.04; and energy, $0.02. These items were partially offset by higher costs for labor and benefits of $0.05, including incentive compensation related to record earnings.","Full year earnings, excluding special items, were $201 million, or $2.06 per share, compared to 2011 earnings of $162 million or $1.61 per share. The $0.45 per share increase in earnings was driven by higher volume of $0.33, and price and mix of $0.06; lower costs for energy, $0.17; recycled fiber, $0.12, and chemicals, $0.05; and a lower share count, $0.05. These items were partially offset by higher costs for labor and benefits of $0.14; depreciation, $0.08; interest expense, $0.06; and transportation; $0.05.","Net sales in the fourth quarter were $737 million, up 13% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. And full year net sales were a record $2.844 billion, up 9% over 2011.","Overall, we had another strong quarter, setting all-time quarterly records for sales, earnings and shipments, despite about 10 box plants in the East and Midwest being impacted more than usual by severe weather conditions. Our corrugated products demand was strong throughout the quarter, and our corrugated products price increase went through as planned.","Moving to more details for the quarter, our corrugated shipments were up 5.8% on a per workday basis compared to last year's fourth quarter, including 2.1% from box plant acquisitions and up 7.6% in total, with 1 more shipping day this quarter. Our shipments per workday were up each month for the quarter compared to last year. And in November, we set an all-time record for any month in shipments per workday, both including and excluding acquisitions.","For the year, our corrugated shipments were up 6.6%, both in total and per workday, with the same number of workdays as in 2011. Of the 6.6% increase, 3% was from box plant acquisitions. Our domestic and export containerboard sales demand remained strong. However, with our increasing integration level and to maintain containerboard inventories at targeted levels, we did sell fewer tons into the export market compared to both last year's fourth quarter and the third quarter of this year. Our export shipments of containerboard were about 8,000 tons lower than last year's fourth quarter, and about 17,000 tons lower than the third quarter of this year. Domestic containerboard sales were down about 2,000 tons compared to both the fourth quarter of last year and the third quarter of this year.","Our mills produced 652,500 tons of containerboard, up 12,000 tons over the fourth quarter of 2011. The higher production was driven primarily by capacity increases resulting from the energy projects at our Counce, Tennessee and Valdosta, Georgia linerboard mills. But it's worth noting that all 4 of our mills set all-time production records for the year, producing 2.6 million tons and ran at essentially 100% of capacity. We ended the year with containerboard inventories, up 6,000 tons compared to the end of 2011, as we needed to begin to build some additional inventory in advance of the 2013 annual maintenance outages.","We've adjusted our mill annual maintenance outage schedule in 2013 to better optimize inventory levels, and also to accommodate the scheduled delivery of critical items needed for the outages.","The only maintenance outage in the first quarter will be the No. 2 paper machine at Counce, Tennessee linerboard mill, which will be down for 5 days in March, reducing production by 7,000 tons and also increasing operating costs. The majority of our maintenance downtime will occur in the second quarter, when we complete our Counce outage, and also have our Valdosta, Georgia, linerboard mill and our Tomahawk, Wisconsin, corrugating medium mill down for their annual maintenance outages.","There are also 2 less calendar days in the first quarter, which will lower mill production by about 7,000 -- 15,000 tons compared to the fourth quarter. And there's 1 less day compared to last year because 2012 was a leap year. We will need to build some additional containerboard inventory in the first quarter to cover our second quarter maintenance outages. This will impact first quarter earnings, but earnings from these tons will be recognized in the second quarter when they are sold. On the box side of the business, there are 2 less workdays than the first quarter of last year.","Looking at pricing, we completed our corrugated products price increase as planned. In total, we achieved the full pass of the containerboard price increase to boxes. From an average price standpoint, we realized about 2\/3 of the total earnings benefit of the box price increases in the fourth quarter, and we realized essentially all of the remaining benefit of the price increases in the first quarter.","Moving to costs, lower recycled fiber costs improved earnings by $0.04 per share, as the industry published prices for old corrugated containers, or OCC. Excluding delivery costs, we're down about $35 a ton in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Our wood costs for both the fourth quarter and the full year were essentially flat with 2011, and we're also able to complete our annual winter wood inventory build in the fourth quarter.","Since early January, a pattern of extremely wet weather in the mid-South has begun to put pressure on wood costs and availability. Our wood inventories are declining, and the extent of the earnings impact from the wet weather in the first quarter will depend on how long the weather pattern persists.","Energy costs were down $0.02 per share compared to last year's fourth quarter, driven mostly by the energy project and lower natural gas costs in our box plants. Finally, labor and benefits were up $0.05 per share compared to last year's fourth quarter, including the cost for higher incentive payouts associated with the record earnings.","I'm now going to turn it over to Rick West, our CFO, who will give an update on our generation and uses of cash and taxes.","Richard B. West","Thank you, Mark. In the fourth quarter, PCA generated cash from operations of $153 million, including the positive working capital change of $25 million. Capital expenditures were $34 million for the quarter, and for the full year, were $129 million. We also spent, during 2012, $35 million for box plant acquisitions. We paid both our October quarterly common stock dividend of approximately $24.5 million and also paid our normal January dividend in December for $24.5 million. We repurchased 103,000 shares of our common stock during the fourth quarter for about $35.35 per share or $4 million. And for the year, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $45 million at an average price of $29.95 per share.","As of December 31, 2012, our diluted shares outstanding were 97.4 million shares. Cash tax payments of $200,000 were made during the quarter for state income taxes and fuel credits of $3 million were used to offset federal taxes. We have estimated remaining fuel tax credits of up to $76 million. We ended the fourth quarter with $207 million in cash, up $66 million from our third quarter ending cash. Our guidance at the end of the fourth quarter was $794 million.","Before I turn it back over to Mark, I have a few estimates for certain 2013 items. We expect capital expenditures in 2013 to be about $120 million. We also may consider spending up to an additional $50 million for either box plant acquisitions or strategic investments in our existing box plants. Preliminary 2013 pension funding and expense estimates, including other post-retirement benefits, are about $31 million and $40 million, respectively.","In terms of cash taxes, after the remaining tax credits are used, our tax -- cash tax rate will go back to about 35%. The final amount of the available fuel tax credits and the final cash tax rate in taxes paid, in both 2012 and 2013, is contingent upon the conclusion of the IRS audit currently underway. Our effective tax rate for income statement purposes is expected to be about 36% in 2013, based on current federal and state tax laws. Our debt pay down, under our $135 million term loan outstanding, will be $15 million in 2013. We currently have no plans to pay down any additional debt in 2013.","Based on current interest rates, our cash interest payments in 2013 are expected to be $32 million, and interest expense will be $38 million, with a $6 million difference between payments and expense due to the amortization of debt refinancing charges.","With that, I will turn it back over to Mark.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Thank you, Rick. Before I move to the first quarter outlook, to sum up 2012, we set several records for both operations and financial results, driven by better-than-expected earnings benefits from our major energy project at our Counce, Tennessee, and Valdosta, Georgia, linerboards mills, and record corrugated product shipments, driven by our ability to provide value to our customers and strategic investments we've made in our existing box plants, as well as our acquisitions.","Based on our strong financial position and the results in 2012, PCA announced on January 14, 2013, an increase in the quarterly cash dividend on our stock, from an annual payout of $1 per share to $1.25 per share, a 25% increase.","Looking ahead to the first quarter, as I mentioned earlier, we expect lower containerboard production and higher operating costs compared to the fourth quarter, with 2 less mill production days and annual maintenance downtime. We also expect higher energy costs with colder weather, and a pattern of extremely wet weather in the South is putting pressure on wood costs and availability. Corrugated products volume will be seasonally lower, and we expect higher costs for recycled fiber and labor and benefits. These items will be partially offset by higher average corrugated products prices, with a full quarter of realization of our fourth quarter price increases. Considering all of these items, we currently estimate our first quarter earnings at about $0.56 per share.","With that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions. I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. These statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company, and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors on our annual report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC. The actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. With that, operator, I'd like to take questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","The first question I had, can you give us the traditional rundown on what your bookings and billings look like early in the first quarter, recognizing it's still early?","Richard B. West","Yes. George, for the first 11 days, from the bookings point of view, we were up 4.5%, billings, 3.5%. As the month goes on, bookings and billings equalize of, again, 4.5% and 3.5% for the first 11 days of January. And George, I might add, that's maybe 1% better than we expected because that's a per workday number. And we have 2 fewer workdays in the first quarter, so that will affect the total number. So it's good, but it's not as good as it sounds because there are less workdays in the first quarter, which will affect the total number. But we're a little better than we expected coming out of the shoot.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Understood. It's consistent with some of the other things that we've seen in our work. I guess second question I had is around the box plant network and vertical integration. I was hoping, given it's the end of the year, that you're reporting that you can give us an update on actually where your vertical integration was for the year? And can you comment a little bit on the plant closure that I guess you did in the fourth quarter and how they relate to the overall network?","Mark W. Kowlzan","On -- regarding integration, for the fourth quarter, we are 83.5% integrated. Full year, it's just under 83% to 82.5% full year. And then again -- what was your second question? I'm sorry.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","No, that was basically it. Just the plant closures, since you need the capacity to some degree, this thing that you're going to invest, what was behind the actual plant closing this year?","Mark W. Kowlzan","We have 1 plant in the Southeast that for a period of time, we had -- quite frankly, we had had a customer that was no longer part of that mix. And so we had an opportunity, it's a very small plant, but we had an opportunity, to shift that volume into another plant in a nearby region. And basically, the total plant closure cost, we did have another plant in the Midwest that was not a plant closure, per se, but we did some modification to the buildings and took some write-off regarding building demolition.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Last one and I'll turn it over. I know there were some incentive comp in the $0.05 in the fourth quarter in terms of higher labor and benefit costs, but is that a run rate, let's call it $0.04, or how would you have us think about it that we should think about for the rest of, well, for 2013 on a quarterly basis?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Paul, you want to get...","Paul T. Stecko","Yes, since I still look at compensation, that number was between $0.02 and $0.03 in the fourth quarter. We had an all-time payout on our incentive compensation plan as we beat our all-time record earnings by 27%. What that number will be in the future will depend on what our level of earnings will be. So our incentive compensation plan has a feature that I would define as affordability. When you're making a lot of money, you can afford to pay higher bonuses, and when you don\u2019t, you can't. And then we have some performance criteria, both external and internal. So the answer to your question is, it will be a function of our earnings this year. And it's not necessarily a run rate number. It will follow, as I said, our earnings. As they go higher, then there's a high probability we'll pay out more. And if our earnings go lower, there's high probability we'll pay out less. So it's not a run rate number.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chip Dillon of Vertical Research.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","First question, can you give us a little bit of direction between the downtime impact? You gave us the first quarter and mentioned the 1 machine at Counce, but how much more in terms of tons will we see in the second quarter versus the, I guess, the 7,000 we'll see from that outage in the first?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Well, again, the first quarter was the Counce machine going down. You're going to see directly, say, 7,000 tons come out of the system with the Counce machine down. But also, by moving the remainder of Counce into the second quarter, basically, the first quarter is about equal to the second quarter when you look at the difference in the number of days with the leap year effect, again, because with the added day last year, that leap year added in, say, another 7,000-plus tons. So in essence, first quarter, second quarter, will be about the same as far as tons impact.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay. And I guess as a related question, could you maybe give us either the final kind of score? I know you were seeing some continued gains from the energy projects and it's been a while, I guess it was November '11 -- 2011, when you completed them. But what -- where that stands in terms of how you see the savings, either EPS or EBITDA-wise? And then how much more there might still be, if any, in 2013?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Yes, as we said on the third quarter call, we expected $0.37 for the year. And we achieved that. As far as any incremental benefits going forward, we don't expect to see any. So again, the project achieved more than we had expected, and as we talked last year, to the second, third quarter calls, we are very comfortable with that $0.37 contribution from the projects.","Richard B. West","The only change to that, Chip, is if energy prices would spike and go up, we're going to see benefits in terms of cost avoidance because basically, we buy no fossil fuel at Valdosta, everything's self-generated. But that's a cost avoidance. It will protect earnings from going down, it won't add to earnings. And I guess the only other thing, we usually can creep capacity at about a 1% a year. This project will probably enable us to be able to do that. And we couldn't have done that without this project. So we may get another, but we're talking maybe 1% of capacity in terms of being able to creep, so you could theoretically say, well, you couldn't have done that without the project. But basically, as Mark said, we've got essentially all of our earnings out of this, with the big proviso, so it does give us cost avoidance protection.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Got you, and this is the last quick one. Is -- you mentioned how stable the wood prices have been, wood cost, and as we go into 2013 and beyond, they're different forces at play, whether it would be, I would guess, higher chip availability with lumber coming back. But then again, you've got these alternative energy-type plants being built, pellet plants. So what do you sort of see for your wood costs, percentage increases, we look out this year, and maybe even into the next year?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Well, again, Chip, just looking at -- coming into this 2013, we're pretty comfortable and our wood costs were flat through the year. We did our winter wood build at Counce, and again, very comfortable with where we were. However, during that Christmas period, we started to see a weather pattern shift through the South and a lot of the heavy rains starting to move up from Texas to Louisiana into the mid-South. So we were impacted pretty dramatically for about a 3.5 week period. And that forced us to start consuming our winter wood build at a much more rapid rate than normal. And so that's one of the primary reasons we've talked about wood cost going up on the short term. Again, we've had a reprieve this week, weather is better. The other regions, we're not seeing any of the impact as far as anything unusual. As far as sawmills and chips, we have seen an uptick in availability of chips, residual chips available at our Northern mills and our Southern mills. So again, as far as anything that's out on the horizon, if the weather behaves itself and gets back into a normal pattern, then there's nothing that should move wood costs either way. So we're not expecting anything dramatic, in that regard.","Paul T. Stecko","Yes, I guess, Chip, this is Paul. The only thing I'd add. I mean, you've said the 2 variables. As wood products improves, there is going to be chip availability, which is definitely a plus. And then there's the uncertainty of these pellet wood plants that could or could not come online, and once more, a short term earlier than the others, a little more long term. So I would say, if you look at the cut rate versus the growth rate, it's pretty good. The question is, can chip plants start to eat into that balance? And most of it -- those -- I mean, pellets, not chips. And most of the pallets are going offshore to Europe and places like that for environmental reasons, for subsidized energy. And the question is, will that continue, will Europe continue to subsidize energy, when they've got problems in terms of costs, Greece, Spain, et cetera. And what will happen in the long term? Will economics prevail, or will government subsidy prevail? And that's probably the most important variable, and that's a tough one to call.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Connelly of CLSA.","Steve Aragon","This is Steve Aragon filling in for Mark Connelly. My first question goes back to fiber costs. It sounds like you're expecting a wetter-than-normal weather in the South, so higher than usual fiber costs, but the EPS progression from fourth to first looks pretty normal. What's offsetting these extra headwinds? I know you mentioned price, but is there anything else there?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Well, again, besides the wet weather, we're in -- it's a colder weather period. We're seeing the colder temperatures up North that we haven't seen for a few years, so the -- energy use, in particular, is going to be higher. And then again, we just don\u2019t know what this winter weather, as far as the rain is going to do. Rick, do you want to elaborate on any of the other changes?","Richard B. West","Yes, I think, rather than looking at fourth quarter '12 to 1Q '13, I think it's a little simpler to look at 1Q '12 to 1Q '13. If you look on that basis, we made $0.42 per share in the first quarter of 2012. With the production day and corrugated product workday difference, the volume that we'll produce and ship in the first quarter of 2013 versus the first quarter of 2012 is expected to be essentially the same. So the second item is cost. You're going to have your normal year-over-year increases in merit and benefits, et cetera, so say that's $0.03 negative, that would take you down to $0.39. We said in the fourth quarter, we recognized about $0.12 per share in price and mix, and it was 2\/3 of the total benefit. So you divide that by 2\/3, you get $0.18. You add the $0.39 plus the $0.18 for price, that gets you to $0.57, then some of these weather things that are unusual, you back off $0.01, that gets you to our guidance of $0.56. So that's a very simplistic way to look at the change in earnings and our guidance.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just on the capital allocation side of things. For the year, you guys bought back $45 million of stock, and Paul, I kind of asked about this last quarter, so I just want to follow up again about as to how you're thinking about things as we enter 2013. If things are more stable out there, would you guys be looking to buy back more stock this year given the cash flow?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Well, I wish things were more stable out there. We would like to buy stock more continually. We've been opportunistic. We didn't buy a lot in the fourth quarter because of the impending \"financial cliff.\" Fairly, uncertain time. We faced the same thing to some extent in the first quarter with the debt ceiling and what its effects it will have on macroeconomics and the stock market in general. So we're waiting for a little more stable time to be more consistent buyers, and if there's any volatility that we think unfairly hits our stock, we're well prepared to be able to take advantage of that. And like you, we're hoping for more stable times, it makes buying stock back a little easier. And that's the best way I can say it, we're not -- we don't have a long-term strategy right now. We have a short-term strategy that still tries to be a little opportunistic. And we'll move to a longer strategy when things get a little more stable.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then on the inventory front, just where you guys are exiting in the year, I know you're talking about building some on the first quarter as -- from a maintenance standpoint. But do you feel comfortable just kind of on a longer-term basis whereas where your inventory levels are right now?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Yes, as we finished up the year, quite frankly, we had hoped to be able to build some inventory with the Christmas storms that took place. We actually ended up with a few thousand tons more than we had planned on. But quite frankly, with the fact that the dynamics are different now during the latter part of the fourth quarter for the last few years, we don't see the December slump like we used to so demand is fairly constant, which again, from going back historically we're used to see an inventory bulge that you'd want to work off during that early part of the -- first part of the year. You don't see that anymore. So again, it creates the necessity to build that inventory that can sustain us through this shutdown period. So it's important that we build an inventory. We're pretty much where we want to be right now. So again, we've spaced out these shutdowns, and that's again, one of the factors that we've looked at as where we take these shutdowns now and space it a little bit longer through the first and second quarter to better accommodate the cut off needs and the mill capabilities during the first part of the year. So regarding that, again, I think where we are at right now in January, inventories are pretty close to where we want them.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just my last question, your major investments are now basically done at the existing mills, you've got the savings locked in. And so, I guess, I'm just wondering from a footprint standpoint, how you're thinking about things moving forward? Is the idea of adding more mills to the system something that you'd be considering at this point or just how you think about that strategically?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Well, just to go back and review. We've talked through the last couple of years about our integration plans moving from the low 80s up to the low 90s, 90% to 92%, 93%. And that remains our focus. And so Tom's been able to create some good opportunities with box plant acquisitions and the organic opportunities with the capital spending from 6 of our plants. But nevertheless, again, we remain focused on that integration plan. We currently -- again, you've heard Paul say this, I've said it, if an opportunity came along and the right price, we'd consider mill acquisitions. That's always something you'd have to consider right now. Again, that's again, our priority is the integration plan.","Paul T. Stecko","Yes. And I'd add, we're not looking for diversion here. Our goal is get to 90-plus percent integration, and that is our main focus.","Operator","It's from Mark Weintraub of Buckingham Research.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Rick, I appreciated the bridge you did of -- from 1Q '13 versus 1Q '12, and I understand that, if we did look though at 4Q to 1Q, it seemed that you had implicitly suggested there'd be about $0.06 positive on pricing mix. And since the number is gone -- going down $0.05, you add the $0.06 to the $0.05, it looks like there's about $0.11 seasonal flash cost variance for Q2, 1Q. Could you help us understand a little bit better what the components are because it seems to be more than the normal seasonal. So whatever you can do to help us out there, that would be great.","Richard B. West","Well, I didn't say it was more than normal. Just to walk you through some of the items. Let's just say colder weather, energy, wet weather, $0.04. We do have statutory benefits that start back up in the first quarter which is more of a timing item, that's about $0.025 to $0.03. Then you have your normal year-over-year increase in wages and some fringes increase which is about $0.025 to $0.03. Then you're looking at recycled fiber, on average, being up about $0.01 a share. And you've got some offsets with different things, inventory, a little less maintenance expense with not as many outages in the first quarter. And then you've got some seasonal volume related, as we said, corrugated products volume will be down the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. But essentially, the same in total year-over-year. So that may have been about, $0.03. So that gets you down to our guidance of $0.56. I think the real difference this year is the more seasonality of the corrugated products volume with less work days than last year. And we had a leap year last year, we don't have one this year. Leap years are good.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Right. I'm sorry, what's the statutory benefits you're talking about versus the other benefits?","Richard B. West","The statutory benefits, your [indiscernible], your [indiscernible], your [indiscernible], people pay those out as they go through the year. So you have a lot of those paid out by the fourth quarter, but you're not getting the expense. And then when you start up in the first quarter, you begin that expense again.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And then does that go back down again in the second quarter or that's just at a higher level versus...","Richard B. West","It goes back down throughout the year as people pay out their benefit requirements for the statutory fringes.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay, so presumably a typical normal year, you would see much of the energy cost weather-related stuff come back in the second quarter, you would see the statutory benefits and the other benefits also come back, is that fair?","Richard B. West","I would say that's a fair, fair assessment. But not all -- it's not necessarily -- it will depend on your rate of pay, the Social Security's capped at $100,000-some, once you get there, some people will get there in the second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter. And that thing, it decays over the year in terms of payment and until you have reached the minimums. But in the first quarter, you take a full hit.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay, and then obviously your seasonal volumes typically get better?","Richard B. West","That's correct. The only thing that goes up is your maintenance expense for outages. That increase because we amortize them over the remainder of the year after they occur.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Well, and on that, you had mentioned that you're going to be building some inventory in the first quarter, but that the sales wouldn't get booked until the second quarter. If you were to sell that production in the first quarter, is that a meaningful difference to what the earnings would be?","Richard B. West","Rough number, $0.01 or so.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And so how much does maintenance go up, second quarter versus first quarter, order of magnitude, earnings last?","Richard B. West","Really, at this point, Mark, we haven't finalized those numbers as we're completing the total cost of our annual shutdown so I would be reluctant to give you that number at this time.","Paul T. Stecko","And Mark, our current practice is we give guidance a quarter at a time, we're not going to start giving estimates for the second, third, fourth quarter on things. So they're just too difficult to make. One quarter at a time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Wilde of Deutsche Bank.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a couple of follow-up questions. First, can you talk a little bit about the sort of net impact from the hurricane because it sounded like you had some box plants that might have lost a little volume, but at the same time, you said that it's a record shipping month in November for you.","Paul T. Stecko","Yes, Mark, I'm going to let Tom expand on that one because we had a few different storm events taking place.","Thomas A. Hassfurther","Yes, Mark, the net impact from Sandy, that impacted a number of our plants, and then additionally, we had the 2 snow storms that came through the Midwest. All in all, that was about $0.01 a share. The difficulty there is estimating, okay if you lose a little bit of business because you shut down, does any of that come back. Typically, if you've got our plants down and our customers' plants down, you're going to lose some sales as a result of that. So that won't show up in the following year.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, but just to be clear, Tom, you did say November was an all-time record month for you guys. Is that right?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","Right.","Paul T. Stecko","And I'd add, Mark, I know you're not a weatherman, but Sandy was in October. And the bad storms were in December. So we had good weather in November, which allowed that.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, and then the other question I had, just -- can you just recap for us again that maintenance that's going to be going on in the second quarter. I know -- if you don't -- can't give us a cost or anything, that's fine. But just to recap for us, what is actually going to be out in the second quarter?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Yes. Again, what we'll do is we're going to complete the Counce outage in April. During that same period of time, we're going to have the Tomahawk mill down in April this year. And then in May, we'll take Valdosta down and complete its annual shutdown in May. And so those are the 3 shutdowns. And just so everyone understands, again, the Filer City mill will not go down until October of this year. We've moved it up to October. We got the flexibility now with the energy infrastructure systems at Filer.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And Mark, if we just went back and looked at sort of what normally happens in terms of these maintenance outages at the 3 mills you've mentioned, is that going to be a pretty good indicator of what we should see this year?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Mark, this year, again, there's just normal outages, mainly inspections. We're not into a lot of big capital upgrades. So this year, it's just routine work, take the mills down, inspect, repair, get them buttoned back up and run again.","Paul T. Stecko","Yes. And Mark, we only give downtime forecast one quarter in advance for various reasons. So we could tell you what's down and the next quarter, when we have the same call, we'll tell you how many tons for the quarter. We don't do it more than a quarter in advance.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, I think we all understand that. I was just trying to make sure that we were doing as well as we could in terms of calibrating that bridge going into second quarter.","Operator","Our next question is of Anthony Pettinari of Citigroup.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Your CapEx, $129 million this year, I think it's a tad higher than what's you're shooting for next year. Can you just remind us as was there any carryover expenses from the energy projects or was there anything that kind of caused that number to be a little bit higher this year?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Again, we said that we'd spend $120 million of normal CapEx between the mills and box plants. And then we have said that on the strategic side, primarily the box plants, we'd set aside perhaps $50 million or $60 million per ton to look at potential acquisitions, strategic opportunities. And so that $9 million, the $129 million, from $120 million to $129 million, is basically strategic opportunity spending that took place. But we have the one acquisition for the year, and so again, we'd looked at some of the opportunities. And one of the opportunities also was Valdosta, with some, again, strategic capability upgrades. So that $9 million differential was strategic opportunity spending.","Paul T. Stecko","Yes. And Anthony, Paul. Just on that point Mark is making. That is just kind of a -- I think it's an interesting anecdote, the way we approach capital spending, minimum effective design, we try not to make sure that things are gold plated when we did the energy project at Valdosta, there's about 5 or 6 things we've could've also done. We assessed the probability of meeting them and the probability on most of these items was 20% and 30%, so we didn't do any of them. And when we get done with the project, they'll always find some things that don't go exactly like you like. And this was a positive one. We were able -- the boiler did better than we thought. And we were able to get out more electricity, and that created a problem. We didn't have enough steam. We looked at it and said, \"Hey, the biggest steam user in the mill is the fan pump drive.\" It's a steam driven pump and we decided it's a -- would be the biggest motor in the bill, so we decided to spend $1 million this year to put in an electric drive instead of a steam drive, that's a $1 million motor. But the payback is $1 million, so 1 year payback. But the whole point of the discussion is that we really do minimum effective design and if you missed something, then you only fix the things that you missed, you didn't put in 5 other things you didn't need. So we'll get a very high return on that. And that's in at numbers that could have been part of the project but it wasn't.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And I guess, just a related question. You referenced the 90% integration goal. When you think big picture over the next 2 to 3 years, do you think you'd get to that 90% mostly through those kinds of strategic spending and strategic initiatives? Or do you get it from the box plant acquisitions, or how should we think about those kind of buckets as you move towards the 90%?","Mark W. Kowlzan","It's a combination. If you look at the benefits of the strategic spending that was completed in 2011, which was a 2010, 2011 spend in the box plants that are half dozen of our plants where we upgraded their capabilities, and then you look at the acquisitions, basically, the incremental volume that we saw in 2012, half of it came from the organic capability in the box plant, half of it came from acquisitions. And so we'll continue that trajectory. And Tom's always looking at acquisition opportunities. And some of that $9 million, that $129 million of capital, some of that $9 million Tom applied at a number of the box plants and strategic pieces of capital that will enable, again, better organic support for customer base.","Operator","Scott Gaffner Of Barclays.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was just curious, the -- you talked about the strong results in November, sort of continuing then into the first quarter a little bit better than expected. Can you talk from a end market demand perspective. Are you seeing any increased demand from housing-related industries or anything related to better industrial production?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Tom, why don\u2019t you look at that?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","Okay. Yes, I think there's some pick up in the economy, I don't think there's any question about that. It's certainly not what I call booming, but I think there is some pick up that's -- it's steady. The housing industry obviously, the numbers are much better. And of course, that will drive a lot of residual customers towards increasing their purchases. So I think that's one of the tailwinds we have going forward.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And longer-term, you've talked about the return of your manufacturing jobs and factories to North America. Are you seeing that currently? Is that starting to impact the results or anything you could provide there on the longer-term outlook for that?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","I wouldn't say there's an immediate impact of results but it certainly is encouraging what Walmart has just decided to do. With setting aside a major amount of purchase in hundreds of billion of dollars towards helping assure that there is some re-shoring of manufacturing to this country. So I'm sure that got the attention of many of our customers and that will bode well for our business going forward.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, the -- throughout the whole price increase discussion that just occurred, and some of the changes in consolidation in the industry over the last 2 years, have you seen any meaningful shift in share particularly in the fourth quarter?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","We're not really in a position to comment about that.","Operator","The next question comes from Philip Ng of Jefferies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Your mills obviously ran very well, it ran close to 100%. Is that 2.6 million number -- production number sustainable and should we assume like a 1% supply creep for 2013?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Yes, the 2.6 million tons is sustainable and with continued discrete investments to support that, 0.5%, 1% is achievable. Again, it depends, again, we've said this before, it's all about how much capital do you want to spend or do you need to spend. But we feel good that the -- that number is sustainable and we can continue to grow at a very conservative ratio.","Richard B. West","And just a caveat on that. The way it normally works is, after you get done with an annual maintenance outage, everything is in tip-top shape. And you could probably run in our system, 102%, 103%, 104% of capacity. And then, you'll lose that ability over the next 12 months as you -- as things wear and you'll get down to less than 100% of capacity like 98%. Counce, for example, ran less than less than full capacity in the fourth quarter because it's at the end of its cycle. And so it's not a linear phenomenon. And the other thing it's not -- we had no major problems in 2012 in our mill system. You have your normal day-to-day, but nothing, no big boiler problems, et cetera. So that has the one caveat, knock on wood, that you don't have a major problem because that would impair your ability to run at 100%. So in a normal year, without any major problems, yes, it's sustainable.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I got you. Are there any other major projects on the horizon that you could actually debottle more incremental capacity than the normal 1%?","Mark W. Kowlzan","No, currently we're not looking at anything big. It's just the day-to-day's -- the things that address cost, reliability, maintaining our uptime, but right now we don't have any big -- nothing of the magnitude of the big energy projects. And you can always come up with projects, that'll be expensive, and just a matter of money, and right now, we want to spend our money and get to 90-plus percent integration level.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I got you. Did you provide some color on inflation on the wood fiber component, what about some of the other major pieces like chemicals cost and starch?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Looking at the first quarter, we didn't see anything in the chemical-related area. And it's more so the normal year-over-year increases in the annual wages, et cetera, and benefits. So that's the biggest one from an inflation standpoint, a little bit on recycled fiber, as I've said earlier.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just one last question. I just want to get a sense from your perspective of the state of the market. It sounds like you're generally a little more upbeat about demand. This time last year we saw some leakage on the pricing export and some spot discounting, but it sounds like the market is much tighter right now. I just want to get to your takeaway.","Mark W. Kowlzan","I think you described it very well, Philip. It's a -- it's certainly better than it was a year ago. Things are pretty tight. Export market, demand remained very strong. So on an overall basis, I think that the market itself is in pretty good shape.","Operator","Comes from Alex Ovshey of Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","As I look at the earnings work from '11 to '12, it looks like volume benefited earnings by more than $0.30, if my models are right. I think you said half of that was acquisition, the other half was organic volume growth. So on the organic side, it's still a very meaningful contribution to earnings in '12 despite the overall industry being flat from a volume point of view. So as we look at '13 and you look at your book of business and the conversations you're having with customers, any color you can provide on how we should think about the benefit that volume could provide to earnings in '13?","Mark W. Kowlzan","We really are not in the position to get in to that. We talk one quarter at a time. So, but the first part of your discussion on the volume, you were correct in your assumption on what the contribution was from volume for the year. But again, moving into anything but this quarter. We're not...","Paul T. Stecko","And it's Paul. The only thing I would add is, as Mark said, we give volume guidance a quarter, any guidance a quarter at a time. But if look at our long track record, 10 years, you can see that we've outgrown the industry considerably, and obviously, that still remains one of our objectives.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Thanks, Paul. And on the export side, can you just talk about the current demand trend you're seeing out there, and whether or not you expect any mix shift between the normal amount of tonnage that you ship with the export versus what you expect to see in 2013.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Yes. As I just mentioned a few minutes ago, the export demand remains very strong. And of course, they're going through a price increase right now, our announced price increase is $60 a euro and that's on recycled. So things are moving up there as well in Europe, and Latin America remains very strong, as well as South America. So I think that as we've talked before, we exported over 250,000 tons, and some of that is going to go to our integration. So that's -- we're not as we've talked before, large exporters, and that we concentrate on a couple of markets. That's all I can really can't comment on. And I think that the worldwide demand is still quite good.","Paul T. Stecko","Just to amplify what Tom said, this is Paul Stecko again. 250,000 tons last year, some of those tons will be needed in our own box plants this year. So we're not as dependent on export as many of our competitors are and will become less dependent on export overtime.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And so the last question. There is a number of capacity conversions in the wings and containerboard, I think most of them are from newsprint to containerboard. I'm curious if you have any thoughts around whether our conversion from newsprint to linerboard would be accepted in the marketplace whether you've seen examples where it's been accepted in the marketplace, and just general thoughts around the conversions that are happening from newsprint to containerboard?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Paul, why don't you to talk to that. You've been studying that one for the last year or so.","Paul T. Stecko","Yes. We've got a lot of questions on that, the problem with answering the question, it's in our discussion because it's very complicated, so I'm going to try to keep it simple and short. I mean there's a lot of variables, no 2 machines are alike. When you try to convert a newsprint machine, you're faced with probably running way at the low end of the weight spectrum. And some which grades are only exportable or aren't consumed in the U.S. And the more money you put into a machine, the more flexibility you can get with regard to weight range, you just have to change more things, so it's all over the map. But the bigger problem with newsprint conversions is that, newsprints primarily uses a lot of hardwood, a lot of ground wood, and you need softwood to make a linerboard. And so, you can have a newsprint mill but there are no trees there to make the pulp from which is a problem. So then you're faced with using recycled fiber, and again, the problem there is most of the newsprint machines are -- would be big, and you'd need a lot of recycled fiber. So you've got some cost exposure and then you got availability exposure because you've got a newsprint machine were there a lot of trees, but not a lot of boxes. Ideally, a recycled mill is going to be someplace like Chicago, New York, were there are a lot of boxes. So fiber doesn't match up really well. That said, there will be some conversions. I think over the next decade, with some re-shoring, and if this economy is going to grow and help with the debt situation, more containerboard capacity will be needed in the U.S. and certainly some conversions will be viable. But it's a very complicated thing, and the ones that we have looked at, there's a lot more -- there's no chance of a conversion that can be converted. So there may be a few gems out there, but in our opinion, there's few and far between.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carly Mattson of Goldman Sachs.","Mike Adler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So I'm -- assuming I'm -- I'm sorry, this is Mike Adler speaking for Carly Mattson. I assume that you were holding $50 million per acquisitions earlier in the call. But could you frame us how you view the opportunities within the broader containerboard space for M&A specifically, is there room for more broad scale M&A, either from a strategic perspective or maybe from a financial buyer and what role could a packaging corp. play there.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Yes, let me answer that. We can't answer that question. We would not want to share that information with any of our competitors. What we're doing in M&A, we like to keep to ourselves for competitive advantages. So that's just a subject that is not appropriate for general discussion. Sorry about that, but that's the way it is.","Mike Adler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I understand.","Operator","Mr. Kowlzan, I see there are no more questions. Do you have any closing comments?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Yes. Thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today, and we look forward to talking to you on the April first quarter call. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference for today.

Your host today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chief Executive Officer of PCA. Upon conclusion of his narrative, there will be a Q&A session.","I will now turn the conference call over to Mr. Kowlzan. Please go ahead, sir.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning and thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's second quarter 2016 earnings release conference call. I am Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA. With me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs the Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer.","I'll begin the call with an overview of our second quarter results, and then turn the call over to Tom and Bob, who'll provide further details. I'll then wrap things up and then we'll be glad to take any questions.","Yesterday, we reported record second quarter net income of $116 million or a record $1.23 per share. Second quarter net income included special items with $1.8 million. Excluding the special items, second quarter 2016 net income was a record $118 million or a record $1.25 per share compared to the second quarter 2015 net income of $116 million or $1.18 per share.","Second quarter net sales were $1.42 billion in 2016 and $1.45 billion in 2015. Total company EBITDA, excluding special items, was $290 million for the quarter compared to $287 million in last year's second quarter. Details of special items for the quarter were included in the schedule that accompanied our earnings press release.","Second quarter 2016 earnings per share excluding special items were $0.07 per share above the second quarter of 2015, driven primarily by higher corrugated product volume, $0.04; lower cost for energy, $0.06; fiber, $0.05; freight, $0.04; and the lower share count resulting from the share repurchases for $0.04. These items were partially offset by lower domestic containerboard and corrugated products price and mix of $0.04; lower containerboard export prices, $0.03; lower containerboard domestic and export volume of $0.04; lower pulp volume, $0.02; and lower paper and pulp prices and mix, a $0.01, and higher depreciation and other fixed costs $0.02.","Earnings were also $0.07 per share above our second quarter guidance of a $1.18 per share. This was primarily the result of slightly better results in several areas including pricing and mix with both Packaging and Paper segments each coming in $0.01 per share better. Also, higher volume of $0.01 per share and cost for freight, fiber, energy and chemicals, all coming in about $0.01 per share lower than our guidance.","Looking at our Packaging business, EBITDA excluding special items in the second quarter 2016 of $267 million with sales of $1.25 billion resulted in improved margins of 23.7% versus last year's EBITDA of $267 million and sales of $1.142 billion or a 23.4% margin. We successfully completed the scheduled maintenance outages at our Counce, Tennessee, and Tomahawk, Wisconsin mills, as well the number two semi-chem medium machine at our Wallula, Washington mill. Operationally, we had an outstanding quarter as we continue to see very good results from our numerous cost improvement initiatives as well as from our logistics and trade optimization efforts across our Packaging business platform.","Containerboard production was 926,000 tons, and our containerboard inventories were about flat with the end of the first quarter of 2016, as well as the end of last year's second quarter and are at an appropriate level to meet our seasonally stronger third quarter demand.","And now I'm going to turn it over Tom who is going to provide more details on the containerboard sales and the corrugated businesses. Tom?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President, Corrugated Products","Thank you, Mark. Corrugated product shipments set all-time records for both total shipments as well as shipments per day. With one additional workday in the second quarter 2016, our shipments were up 2.2% in total, and up 0.6% per workday compared to the record second quarter of 2015. As a comparison, the industry was up 1.8% in total, and 0.3% on a workday basis.","To support our corrugated products volume growth during the annual maintenance outages, we've reduced our outside sales of containerboard by about 12,000 tons below last year's second quarter and about 8,000 tons below the first quarter of this year. Both domestic and export volumes were lower versus each comparative period. Export prices were about 8% below second quarter 2015 levels or $0.03 per share at about 3% lower than the first quarter of this year. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.04 per share below the second quarter of 2015 and up, compared to the first quarter of 2016.","I will now turn it back to Mark. Mark?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Tom. Looking at our Paper segment, EBITDA, excluding special items, in the second quarter was $39 million with sales of $267 million or 14.5% margin compared to the second quarter of 2015 EBITDA of $37 million and sales of $281 million or a 13.2% margin.","Paper segment price and mix was lower than the second quarter of 2015 but $12 per ton higher than the first quarter of 2016. White paper sales volume was up slightly and pulp volume was lower compared to the second quarter of 2015 while volumes of both white paper and pulp was lower than the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to the scheduled annual outages at two of the mills. Both of the scheduled outages were completed successfully and the mills ran exceptionally well during the quarter with very good costs. White paper prices began to improve late in the second quarter as a result of the announced paper price increase.","I'm now going to turn it over to Bob Mundy.","Robert P. Mundy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Mark. We had a very good strong free cash flow generation in the second quarter with cash provided to operations of $180 million, CapEx of $69 million resulting in free cash flow of $111 million for the quarter. We paid common stock dividends totaling $52 million, made a $2 million scheduled term loan repayment, and we had no share repurchases during the second quarter.","We ended the quarter with $214 million of cash on hand. And finally, our scheduled annual outage cost will be lower in the third quarter than the original guidance we provided earlier in the year, as we can now operate our Jackson, Alabama paper mill into the first quarter of 2017, before an outage is necessary.","Our new guidance for annual outage costs for the balance of the year is $0.09 per share in the third quarter and $0.11 per share in the fourth quarter or a total of $0.42 per share for the year versus the $0.49 per share we guided to earlier. I'll turn it back to Mark.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Bob. On July 6, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of TimBar Corporation, a large independent corrugated products producer, in a cash-free, debt-free transaction for a cash purchase price of $386 million. This acquisition is consistent with one of the key strategic focus areas we've discussed many times regarding increasing our vertical integration of containerboard to above 90% through organic box volume growth and strategic box plant acquisition. We expect this acquisition to increase our integration by over 200,000 tons or 6% from our current level of 87% and will allow for further optimization and enhancement of our mill capacity, and other substantial benefits and synergies that we expect to begin realizing soon after closing.","It comes in an excellent time following our recently completed integration of Boise, including the capacity we now have at the DeRidder, Louisiana mill. We believe that this acquisition will allow us to further enhance our strong balance sheet, financial results and cash flow consistent with our strategy to return significant value to our shareholders. We're on track to close the acquisition, subject to certain customary conditions and regulatory approval later in the third quarter, and we expect to finance the transaction with a new term loan.","Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect higher containerboard, corrugated products and white paper shipments, and paper prices should move higher reflecting continued realization of the announced paper prices. Also, as Bob mentioned earlier, our annual outage costs will be lower than our original guidance as a result of moving our Jackson, Alabama paper mill outage into the first quarter of 2017. We do expect a less rich mix for corrugated products and higher prices for recycled fiber, electricity and natural gas. Considering these items, we expect third quarter earnings of $1.30 per share.","With that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions but I must remind you, some of the statements we've made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. These statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.","And with that, operator, I'd like to open the call for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Sure. Your first question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.","Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes. Good morning.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Chip.","Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","First question is, looking at TimBar. Just from what I gather looking at industry returns in the box business, and I know they vary tremendously, but it seems like that the attractiveness of integrating vertically just continues to increase. Is it fair to say that maybe half of the EBITDA you expect over time will actually come not from what you're buying but from the improvements you'll get after you buy them?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Chip, let me start this off and then I'm going to have Tom add a little color to TimBar. I'm not going to quantify that exactly but your premise is correct. A very, very large portion of the contribution will come from the 200,000 plus tons that we're able to pass through the system. Again, it's very valuable in that regard. And then a smaller portion would come from synergy-type activity in terms of integrating the actual business. And then the tax step-up opportunities along with the EBITDA we're buying. But keep in mind, it's an extremely high quality, diverse book of business, a high-margin book of business. So, Tom, do you want to add any color to that one?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President, Corrugated Products","Well, I would just say, Chip, that I think one of things that \u2013 yes, you're right, and you're close to right in terms of the EBITDA contribution coming from both areas. But to assure that EBITDA, and this is why we're so disciplined in these acquisitions, you've got to have a great culture so it's got to fit very well. They've got great people and a great leadership team and, as Mark mentioned, a very, very good customer base. It's also geographically a good fit for us and solid assets as well. So, all-in-all, I mean, we've got great confidence that this is going to be a terrific acquisition for us.","Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And then, a second one, just \u2013 we've noticed that in this year, despite some of the, I guess, lower realizations for kraft linerboard in the export markets that exports are up. But as we dig through the numbers, it looks like that the actual kraft linerboard exports are down, and you're seeing the total number go up because we're sending more recycled, medium, and other grades offshore, at least as an industry. Is that a reflection of some of the quality issues you think that we're seeing with some of the recent recycled additions, or do you have any other view on that?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Let me start this out, Chip, this is Mark. Again, I think as you've seen the consolidation taking place in the last couple of years, and you read what you and others have been publishing, obviously the integrated tons have grown. And so, today, there is probably 92% of all of the containerboard tons passing through integrated activity. So it's becoming less and less in terms of an outlet for independent mini mill type activity to move their tons through.","So, as we stated, we \u2013 in order to accommodate our own needs, we took tons out of the export and domestic outside sales to support our own growth activity. But, again, I think it's safe to say that there is less of an outlet domestically as more and more tons are passing through integrated activity. Tom, you want to go ahead and elaborate?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President, Corrugated Products","I don't have really a lot to add to that. I think Mark is absolutely correct. I mean, you've just got to look at the supply and say supply is going to gravitate to where the demand is and most of the demand is tied up with integrated and we're much more performance oriented, of course here in the U.S. The kraft linerboard meets that criteria. So I think you're going to have a lot more here. I think you also have some situations where some people have decided to supply their own facilities out of this country with their own linerboard and they will determine what grades they want to supply. So I think that's what you are seeing. Really, export demand is relatively stable.","Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","I see. Thank you.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you. June, the numbers for the industry were very robust. I was hoping to get a sense as to how July has been looking for you and whether you feel there has been a shift in tenor in the market in the last month or so?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Tom, why don't you go ahead and provide that?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President, Corrugated Products","Well, Mark, the first10 days of July our billings are up about 1.5%. So we're off to a decent start. It's a little money to get started in July just because of the way that 4th fell. So it's \u2013 when it falls on a weekend like that it's tough to get a really good take on where things are headed. But I think we're off to a pretty good start.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","And is there a different feel to the market given what we've been seeing from the overall industry data the last six weeks to eight weeks, or is it more a continuation of how you've been experiencing the market year-to-date?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Mark. This is Mark again. I think what we're seeing as we went through the second quarter and what we're seeing these couple of weeks after the holiday is it's flat. Again, we're pleased to see the numbers where they are at this stage in July, but other than that no other color to add to that one.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. And kind of the in the weed question. So $0.42 I think is now the revised expectation for maintenance and outage cost this year. Would you consider that to be a fairly standard number or a bit below normal? I think it was much in the high 50s if I remember last year.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You know, Mark, that number \u2013 now that we've got a lot of integration activity behind us, that number is going to float depending on the extent of an annual shutdown, work that has to be done on our mill. And so, in an example too, we have the capability as well as others in the industry to move shutdowns into the following year. So we're not tied to necessarily a 12-month window. And so, there is a range somewhere within that $0.40 range, unless we call out some unusual type of maintenance activity that would occur.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, Mark, Tom, Bob.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Mark.","Robert P. Mundy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning, Mark.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President, Corrugated Products","Good morning, Mark.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Is it possible, Mark, to get some sense on TimBar of how the benefits will roll through, just from a kind of a timing standpoint? In other words, how quickly can you bring things like those board purchases in-house?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean, if you assume we get this closed by the end of the third quarter, we'll be able to immediately start moving tons through and our plans would be to have this heavily integrated by the end of the year. Tom, do you want to?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President, Corrugated Products","I will just add, Mark, that as you will \u2013 as you could probably well imagine, TimBar has contracts that they've got out there that we will honor. So, some of those roll out by the end of the year but the great majority of it we'll be able to accomplish in the fourth quarter, I would expect.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. Okay. That's exactly what I was hoping to pickup. And just on the converting side, you've been buying converting businesses, increasing your integration. I wonder though, Tom, could you also talk about what you might be doing in the way of just investment in your existing converting operations? I mean, we hear a lot from other players over the last five years or six years about investments in mega plants and EVOLs and things like that?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President, Corrugated Products","Yeah. Mark, this is Tom again. Yeah, we continue \u2013 as has been our tradition at PCA, we have consistently spent what we consider to be the correct amount of CapEx to reinvest in our businesses to stay up with the trends, to stay up with our ability to be a very low cost producer, and to meet the demands of the customers that we have.","And, of course, one of our mantras for doing this is that we don't just build it and hope they will come. We do what our customers need and we're very responsive to that. So, I'm not going to go into great detail obviously on this call about all the things that we've done, but rest assured, we're doing all the things that we need to do.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then the last question I had is, Mark, can you put any more color around, what you are expecting in \u2013 from input cost pressures in the second half, we can see that OCC prices have been ticking up for the last three months here. And I think, things like natural gas are up as well?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President, Corrugated Products","Yeah. Primarily, we're talking about three buckets that we've been watching and that's our recycled fiber, OCC, DLK prices moving up as they have this year.","And then, the natural gas, year-over-year, pretty obvious that a year ago, we were down at the low point and it's moved up now. And so, when you look at that, transportation elements we're watching what's going on there, even though there hasn't been a big move, we are seeing some of the Class 1 railroads already raising rates.","And then, there are other, the seasonal electric, summer-time electric rate spike in increased activity through the July-August period and September depending on weather conditions around the country. So again, for the first time in the last year and a half or so, we're seeing some of the inflationary activity that we're watching closely.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.","Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you. If I could come back to the question of exports for just a second, it's pretty clear that other producers are looking at that business differently than they used to and we're not seeing the level of export sensitivity, the FX rates that we used to see. Is that changing the way you think about the strategic value of exports for PCA?","And then, a second question on white paper. The label paper business was a strategic move for Boise a number of years back. And I'm curious, how important the specialty grades are to you in the context of your white paper mix?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. First question regarding the currency and export, I mean, we view again our exports, we have legacy export customer base for 25 years. We ship products out to about 35 different countries around the world. And so, obviously exports remain little less than 10% of our total production. That being said, as Tom continues to grow his own integration level higher, we have an internal meet. That's our best use of a ton produced. And so, again, it's been easier for us to look at where to best place those tons to capture the best margin as we see in the currency swing over the last year.","Regarding that second part of the question, the specialty business the release liner grade, the coated business, especially \u2013 primarily from the Wallula machine now. It's proved to be good business for us. We've done a tremendous amount of grade development and refinement over the last two years, and with the other improvements we've built into the mill. It's again label business primarily performing very well. And label, in general, still grows with the GDP. So, as long as GDP continues to move forward with label business, which is a bulk of that, release specialty coated business continues to move forward. So, it's a pretty good little business for us in the Paper segment.","Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Would you have any thoughts of moving further into specialty?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","As we said over the last couple of years, we are primarily a corrugated products business, and we are going to stay concentrated in that. We are not really compelled to grow that business as much as just nurture what we have and take advantage of the EBITDA contribution from the Paper business.","Keep in mind that in today's world it's probably 15%, 16% or so of our total annualized EBITDA but it does generate a nice cash flow for us and doesn't require an awful lot of capital to maintain right now. So, I guess, a long way of saying, I would not have preference to explore expansion in that area.","Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Super helpful. Thank you.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Debbie.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I have a question that I recognize you may not be able to answer, but I'm going to try it anyway with TimBar. Obviously, this is a great acquisition for you guys strategically, not much to criticize. But as you pointed out, the industry is far more integrated. I think you pointed to 92%. Does that concern you at all just broadly speaking about how PPW now has a much smaller set or sample size to measure when trying to determine what industry pricing is. And I just think it's important just considering that impacts a lot of your contracts and the industry contracts going forward?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think, I'm going to say a few things and then I'll let Tom add some color, but again, I think it's that issue that there is a mechanism in place and how that mechanism functioned is \u2013 it's again that's \u2013 pulp and paper has utilized that base. And so, rather than getting into any forward discussion about pricing or speculation, I'd rather, again to your point, not even go there. Tom, I think, you feel the same way.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President, Corrugated Products","Yeah. I do and I mean obviously, they're not a lot of other alternatives and pulp and paper has been over the long haul seems to get it right. Now, there are times \u2013 there are times when we would disagree but we'll have to see what happens going forward. I think the most important thing is that pulp and paper reports the news as opposed to trying to make the news. So, we'll just see what transpires going forward. But your observation is correct. It is a smaller segment on that open market.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And my second question, I just wanted to understand in your guidance, what do you have rolling through on white paper, just what has been put through so far by PPW, and kind of just thoughts going forward on whether or not there could be more to come?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, Debbie, you know, if you think about our business and what has been announced by the publications, on the printing and converting grades, the announcement was made for a $60 increase in March, and the index has picked up $10 in April and $15 in May and $5 in June for a total of $30, as reported in the latest update. On office papers, that announcement was for April, to be commencing in May. And so, again the index has picked up $5 in May and $5 in June. So, that's what basically will be tied to contract paper sale.","And also understanding that in our Paper business roughly 65% of our uncoated free sheet is tied to contracts. And so, the balance of it is not tied to contracts. So, we have a heavy portion of that that is tied to these indices.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. I'll turn it over.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies & Company.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. Energy prices were up sequentially. Impressive you saw that type of cost savings on the energy line and transportation. How much of that is being just more efficient now, and is that kind of cost saving sustainable in light of some of the moves that we're seeing in nat gas prices?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think to your point, as we continue to improve not only the white paper mills but the folks that run the brown business containerboard mills are always out making improvements year after year in fuel utilization in terms of consumption efficiencies. And so, we have reaped the benefits year after year on how we utilize our fuels. But that being said, natural gas, as an example, bottomed out a year ago, and so now it's moving up. So, Bob, do you want to add anything?","Robert P. Mundy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No. I think what you said is exactly right. That's how I would see things going forward.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And, I guess, even post TimBar, based on our math at least, your balance sheet still looks pretty strong and integration is going to be pretty high. Can you just talk about how you rank your capital deployment priorities from here on out, M&A? And how does that look on a converting front or is there more opportunity now on the Paper side of things?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, again, concentrating on the corrugated products side of the business, that's our highest margin, highest opportunity area to concentrate on in terms of capital utilization. And so, we would continue, as Tom is always doing, looking at opportunities in box plant acquisitions. And also he said something important earlier, how he grows his existing business organically with the existing customers. So, I think again, prioritizing the use of cash and capital, it's Tom's corrugated business and high margin activity within the corrugated business. And so, Tom, do you want to add anything to that? I mean, that's....","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President, Corrugated Products","Phil, I would just say that we will still be very disciplined in our hurdle rates that we have for our M&A activity, and also grow our CapEx. That's not going to change. And as we get to \u2013 our integration level gets up to a point where we're a little bit capacity constrained, obviously, we're not going to have quite the synergies for some of those acquisitions but that doesn't mean we won't do them if they're right for the business.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Got you. That's actually a good segue to what I was going to ask next. Once you integrate TimBar, how much more capacity do you guys have on the board side of things? Do you need \u2013 is it like one year's less (32:35) runway? And once you are tapped out, are you guys looking at M&A or is there organic opportunities internally for you to kind of produce more tons?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm not going to answer that specifically, but as we've always done, we always have the ability to creep and to stretch our capability, that the technology organization, and the group that runs the containerboard mills are always challenged to produce more when Tom needs it. And so, we have a portfolio of capital items and improvement plans in the files on how we will go forward over the next couple of years to support Tom's growth needs. And so, we're comfortable for the time being, the next couple of years. And don't forget, as we did back in 2012, we still have the lower margin export tons to move through Tom's higher margin book of business as he needs. So we've got a few years to do this.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Really helpful. Thanks a lot.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Scott.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President, Corrugated Products","Good morning.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So, when I look at the vertical integration, I think you said \u2013 I mean, you didn't get specific but you said 87% now plus 6% from TimBar. So assuming somewhere in the low 90s on an integration level. I mean, where was the integration level for the company as a whole before you did the Boise acquisition?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We were at that low 90%, 92%, 93% level when we did Boise, and it was the same opportunity metrics we looked at as far as how are we going to support Tom's growth trajectory over a longer period of time and Boise presented a tremendous opportunity to do just what we've done over the last three years.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And maybe a different question there just on the vertical integration. I mean \u2013 and you mentioned before, TimBar had some high-margin business that came along with it. Is there the potential to prune maybe some lower margin business from the portfolio, and vertically integrate with more higher margin business going forward?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We're not going to comment on that question.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That's proprietary.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Fine. Then, when I look at the organic growth rate, I know I've asked this one before, but you said you were up 0.6% on a per workday basis in the quarter, the industry was up 0.3%. So, organically your level of growth relative to the market is narrowed somewhat. How long do you think you can continue to outgrow the market organically on a go-forward basis excluding any sort of additional vertical integration?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Obviously, I can't answer that. All I can say is that's Tom's challenge every day of the week and it's been his challenge for years, and that's what we're going to continue to do, and that's how we look at the world. And I would be terribly disappointed if we didn't continue to perform in that manner.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I guess, maybe asked a different way, has it become more difficult to outgrow the market at this point in time?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I wouldn't say that. Again, it's \u2013 I don't want to comment on that.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Last one for me. Just on inventories, you noted that they were flat sequentially, flat year-over-year, I think is what you said. I thought in some previous comments, maybe on the last call, you noted that inventories could come down just based on better freight availability. Has that not been the case during the quarter or is it something \u2013 some other sort of dynamic played out?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We've commented that we're in a range that we're very comfortable with supporting comps business. And if you go back to what we called out last fall that we \u2013 because of the DeRidder success, we did not have the need to have to grow inventory, and build inventory in the fourth quarter of last year.","So, we're quite pleased with the fact that we went through all of our annual shutdowns in the first quarter and second quarter, and not only supported Tom's business but maintained a range of containerboard inventory that we feel is where we need to be, plus or minus for the corrugated. And so, it goes back to the fact that even though transportation availability and cost for transportation had abated and the availability improved in the last two years, nevertheless, our footprint with Boise and acquisition activity is a nationwide footprint. We called this out before. So, we're mindful of that and again this range we're in for the last year now is a good range that we identified.","But also keep in mind that as we integrate TimBar, they do have the corrugating plants that we're going to have to support. So, it will be a reevaluation of what is the right inventory level to support a much bigger full-line corrugating system.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Mark.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo Securities.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, gentlemen, and congratulations on a strong quarter.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Chris.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Just a couple questions, follow up question for you. Most of the stuff I wanted to ask has kind of been answered. But first on the Papers side of the business, is there any reason that perhaps, and again, I appreciate you don't like to comment so much on forward-looking pricing but is there any reason that the white paper side might not kind of work out the way that the specialty paper side did in that it kind of takes two months, three months, four months to trickle through pricing. I mean, we're kind of a couple of months into that. But any reason to suspect that we couldn't continue to see a little more of the increase that most of the participants announce get realized?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I want to speculate on it. That's forward pricing speculation that's some place that we don't need to go there. I guess, we just have to wait and see what RISI, Paper Trader, what the indexes call out.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. So, thank you. Let me skip ahead to the \u2013 you had a few questions around how you balance tons on a future basis from an allocation standpoint. So, if you kind of \u2013 as TimBar gets fully put together out in 2017 and integrated into your network, as you would sit today, it would look like either you'd stop selling so much to the domestic guys, or you could stop exporting kind of one or the other.","If I'm getting this or putting this together right, it sounds more like if some place gets shorted, you prefer to kind of pull back out the export market. Is that a fair way of thinking that or how do you balance...","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. There's a couple of ways to do that. I mean, you are looking at what's your ultimate margin per ton in terms of where you are placing those containerboard tons that we produce. And if the math tells you to go ahead and sell one less ton and move it through Tom's system, that's what you do.","And so, there is another element to that and it also as we did in the 2012 period \u2013 2013, we were buying some tons in the open market where it made sense. So, if it makes sense for us to buy tons in the open market and still sell some tons offshore, again, it's a tradeoff of margins and how it flows through the bottom line. So, we've got that trigger to pull.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then last question I had, and again I know you don't like to get super granular with this stuff, but was there any kind of differential either geographically, regionally, et cetera with how your box shipments and volumes were through the quarter? Was it a little better in certain regions of the country versus others? Anything, variance even month-to-month. It seems like the things got better as the quarter progressed \u2013 that you could share with us?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I'm going to let Tom to put some color on that one.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President, Corrugated Products","Yeah, Chris. You're right. It did get better as the quarter progressed. And regionally, most of our regional trends come from what's happening in ag business in various parts of the country or something like that. Beyond that it's relatively steady.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","But the ag business was \u2013 I mean, how would you characterize that?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President, Corrugated Products","Good in some parts, and not so good in other parts, and mostly weather related.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, guys. Thank you very much and good luck on the go-forward.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President, Corrugated Products","Thank you.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Welcome. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good morning.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President, Corrugated Products","Good morning, Anthony.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Regarding M&A, you obviously, have a great history with box plant acquisitions. Given that the independents are maybe now 8% of the market, are there still converting assets out there that are attractive or when you look at asset quality and valuation, are there not really many opportunities left there? And then just continuing on the M&A side, would we ever see, Packaging Corp book at other substrates, I'm, thinking, folding cartons or box board, and then also other geographies outside of the U.S.?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The first part of the question \u2013 obviously with the activity on box plant acquisitions over the last couple of years, the opportunities have become less, but nevertheless, there are opportunities that will always be there. And Tom is aware of what's out there, and we're pretty particular as we have proven to be over the last number of years in what we're interested in, and what we're willing to pay for. And so, again, that's the best way to answer that.","Folding carton, that's just speculation. I mean, I don't even want to get into that dialogue. We're going to \u2013 as I said earlier, we are primarily a corrugated products business and that's what we do well and that's what we will remain concentrated in.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And in terms of overseas or outside of the U.S. interest level there?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Again, we're U.S. based and I think the U.S. is the place to be.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. And just the last one export pricing, understanding that exports are a small part of your business and are probably going to get smaller. The July Pulp & Paper Week pricing data seemed to show some stability in export pricing. I'm just wondering if, maybe Tom, if you could give any color in terms of what you're seeing in the export markets that you're serving?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President, Corrugated Products","Yes. I would agree with you. Anthony. The prices have stabilized. We have currency issues that remain. Of course, the biggest being in the UK which is a very, very small piece of our business and there is pricing \u2013 increased activity going on there and we've announced it actually as well and that's mainly to cover this enormous currency change that took place with Brexit.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Securities.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Hi, guys.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, George.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Appreciate you taking my questions, most of them have been already answered. I guess, the first question I had, so if I look at third quarter versus second quarter, traditionally you'll tend to see upwards of about $0.10 sequential move from whatever the 2Q base was. This quarter you've guiding to a $0.05. Is that variance largely related to input cost? Would there be anything else related to? And then, kind of a separate but related question. In the past, you gave us a view on what you were expecting in terms of, I guess, the January price declines to show up in terms of your P&L and corrugated. Did you more or less see that realize as expected? And then a couple of follow-ons?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, regarding that last question, we called out that first quarter about a $0.01 of impact on containerboard price, and then 2Q, $0.02, and then we're anticipating the third quarter following on with $0.02.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President, Corrugated Products","Yeah, on the Other, George, yeah, I mean, moving sequentially from the second to the third, you are right, input cost last year moving second to third were actually a favorable trend environment. And this year, as Mark has pointed out, on the energy side and recycled and whatnot, you have the opposite thing going on. So that would be really what drives that difference.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Bob, I recognize you're not in a position right now to talk much about TimBar. And so, I preface my question with that and understand whatever answer you can give, we respect it. If we could get into the numbers, would TimBar be a more cash generative business to you relative to your existing converting operations? How would you have us think about that business? It sounds like it's higher margin, but maybe it also takes a little bit more capital to get at those margins?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","George, this is Mark. Again, and you heard Tom say this and I believe I've called this out, the TimBar assets are very well capitalized, really nice facilities. So the only thing that \u2013 and again, this is just speculation, as Tom does every quarter and every year, he looks at the book of business within that region and how you satisfy the customer growth needs. And so, on a going-forward basis, there is no current big overhang of what we would have to do with capital to see that cash accretion to the bottom-line.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. So, conclusion, then, this should be a more cash accretive business relative to your existing converting margins because I think you've already said it's higher margin, very high mix \u2013 high margin mix, excuse me, and no big capital programs. You'd agree with that then?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I'm not going to quantify that. I'm just qualifying that it's a very accretive opportunity for us, and you'll see us very quickly put that benefit to the bottom line.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Totally. Two last ones. And I think you've already answered the question, but I just want to get precision on it. So in the second quarter, your production was down \u2013 I want to say 25,000 tons from last year. I'm assuming that's purely a function of \u2013 you didn't need to run as much into inventory ahead of maintenance outages this year, and the flexibility you get from DeRidder. Is there anything else in terms of why production would have been down, other than what I just relayed? And then, Bob, just housekeeping, there was no buyback in the quarter. Was that a function of just what you thought of the value of the stock? I know it's hard to answer that, or just you were in blackout because you knew you were going to do the TimBar deal? Thanks, guys. And good luck in the quarter.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Let me answer that first part, George. This is Mark. If you recall, last year, we actually produced 937,000 tons during the second quarter.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And this year, we've called out the production of 926,000 tons. Now again, there are two things that are in play there. It's the timing of the actual outages that occur in containerboard mills that can move that quarter-to-quarter but year-over-year, last year in particular, we were in a heavy lifting mode to get DeRidder optimized and delivering for us. And so, we also had come out of the 2014 fourth quarter and we called out the need to pre-build inventory because of the rather heavy shutdown activity that was going to occur, primarily the DeRidder activity, and finetuning of DeRidder. So, DeRidder was an event that went through the first quarter and second quarter last year, which really forced us to run hard and make sure that we had the adequate inventory by the end of the second quarter to fulfill the typical seasonal higher third quarter. So, we built to that 937,000 ton production to make sure as we entered July and August we were in good shape.","But the fact that as of last September we concluded the DeRidder number three upgrade activity and proved that that machine can perform as we need and as demand requires, we had truly \u2013 if you want to use the term running to demand, we were not compelled to have to run to any higher inventory level. So that's truly, and we called this out, that because of the annual shutdown activity we sold less on the outside, but also there was no need to build and run in any different way and also, how the shutdown fell (50:34). So, that's really a long way of explaining to you the 12,000 tons of difference between last year's 2Q to this year's 2Q.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right.","Robert P. Mundy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And on the buyback, certainly, we remained to look for those opportunistic situations on share buybacks in the second quarter, you're correct. The pending TimBar deal certainly was something we had to consider that we normally wouldn't have to consider so that certainly had an impact (51:05)","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. I appreciate the color. Good luck in the quarter guys.","Robert P. Mundy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with Roe Equity Research.","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research","Hi. Good morning.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Gail.","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research","This might be a little out there question, but the last time we saw the dollar this strong was really at the turn of the century when there was a lot of off-shoring activity. And I'm just wondering, are you hearing anything from your customers, that they might start to kind of reconsider, obviously that have played out, and just any concern from the domestic demand side in terms of the strong dollar?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Tom, do you want to....","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President, Corrugated Products","I'll just answer that real quickly for you, Gail. One of the things that certainly has had a bit of an impact of the strong dollar is the exports from the industry in general, and you've read a lot about that. So, that had a little bit of an impact. And relative to off-shoring, I mean, I'm seeing more of a trend of off-shoring today as labor rates continue to go up elsewhere in the world and quality issues and supply chain issues and all these other sorts of things that exist. I think, we've got more companies today considering bringing business back to the United States than sending it overseas.","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research","Okay. And, you guys may disagree with it, but certainly it feels like there has been \u2013 despite the shrinking independent size of the box market there has been more and more activity. Do you feel that the transition of some of the recent box plant deals have been done as tons have been integrated has been managed well or any concerns of disruptions in the market just as things get readjusted?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Gail, I don't want to comment on what others are doing and how they've done it. You should be talking to them.","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research","Okay. And can you just talk finally a little bit upon wood cost and what you are seeing in the near term? We've heard less and less about pellet activity. Is that less of a concern for you kind of looking at over the medium term than it might have been two years, three years ago?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Wood cost over the last few quarters have been pretty less. We saw a little bit of heavy rains down in the Texas, Louisiana region this spring that caused some short-term spikes and disruption in fiber, but it's nothing significant for our DeRidder mill, again which is \u2013 we watched it.","But, in general, to the rest of the system it's been very flat through the year and we expect to see that flat, unless again we get into an unusual fall winter rain event period later in the year but otherwise we are flat with fiber on virgin wood fiber.","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research","Okay. And just kind of on a longer term basis on pellets. I think that was a concern for you a couple of years ago. Is it still a concern, less a concern?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Again, you've seen in, in particular the Southeastern region and Gulf Coastal region with more pellet activity. I think it's kind of come to an equilibrium from all indication. So, we watch it but I'm not concerned about it at this point.","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research","Okay.

And please proceed when you are ready.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, and thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's first quarter 2015 earnings release conference call.","I'm Mark Kowlzan, CEO of PCA. With me on the call today are Paul Stecko, our Chairman; Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President who runs our Packaging business; Judy Lassa, Senior Vice President who runs our White Papers business; and Rick West, our Chief Financial Officer.","I'll begin the call with an overview of our first quarter results, and then I'll turn the call over to Tom, Judy, and Rick, who'll provide more details. I'll then wrap things up and then we'll be glad to take any questions.","Yesterday, we reported first quarter net income of $91 million or $0.92 per share compared to last year's first quarter net income of $90 million or $0.92 per share. First quarter net income included charges for Boise integration and DeRidder mill restructuring of $9 million or $0.09 per share.","Excluding these special items, net income was $100 million or $1.01 per share compared to last year's net income of $106 million or $1.08 per share. Net sales were $1.4 billion in both first quarter of 2015 and 2014. Excluding special items, the $0.07 per share reduction in first quarter 2015 earnings compared to the first quarter of 2014 was driven by increased annual mill outage downtime in costs for $0.08, lower white paper prices and changes in mix $0.05, lower export containerboard prices $0.02, and higher cost for wood $0.04, medical $0.04, labor and benefits $0.04 and depreciation $0.02. These items were partially offset by increased volumes for $0.09 and lower costs for energy $0.06, chemicals $0.02, and purchased fiber $0.02, and the state tax credit related to the investments at the DeRidder mill are $0.03.","Lower earnings compared to PCA's guidance of $1.07 to $1.10 per share for the first quarter was the result of extreme weather conditions for $0.03, additional downtime to complete the DeRidder annual outage for $0.03 and lower prices from the retroactive price decrease by trade publications and mixed changes in white papers for $0.03.","Extreme weather conditions resulted in higher mill cost and also lower corrugated product shipments with downtime at 20 of our corrugated products plants, including 12 plants with downtime of more than two days during the quarter. The DeRidder annual mill outage took about six days longer to complete than we expected. The additional downtime was the result of vendor design errors, which required equipment to be modified after it was received.","Looking at more details of our operations, packaging EBITDA excluding special items was $222 million and net sales were $1,099 million compared to last year's packaging results, excluding special items of $244 million and net sales of $1,097 million. The $22 million reduction in EBITDA was the result of this year's extended annual outage at the DeRidder mill, which did not have an annual outage in 2014 as well as higher wood, medical, labor and benefits and freight costs and lower export containerboard prices. These items were partially offset by corrugated products volume growth and benefits from the DeRidder 3 machine converted.","Containerboard production in the first quarter was 882,000 tons, up 61,000 tons compared to last year's first quarter, driven by tons produced on the DeRidder No. 3 machine. We ended the quarter with our containerboard inventory down 3,000 tons from year-end levels. This was our first annual outage at DeRidder since acquiring Boise in October of 2013.","The outage was extensive including major projects involving the turbine generator, pulp mill, recovery boiler, and paper machines. The outage is planned for 16 days due to the length of the time required for pulp mill work, but actually required six additional days because of the time required to resolve issues involving incorrectly manufactured equipment for the D1 machine that I mentioned earlier.","The D3 machine ran well during the quarter at about 80% of capacity. This rate will sustain our current demand and in September, we'll be installing some additional dryers, which will give us the capability to run at 100% of capacity on both linerboard and medium grades. Current efforts on D1 involve continued product development and cost optimization.","The No. 1 paper machine at our Counce, Tennessee linerboard mill was also down five days in March for an annual outage. In early April, we completed the Counce mill outage with the No. 2 machine down for five days. Other second quarter planned outages include five day outages at both our Filer City, Michigan and Tomahawk, Wisconsin medium mills.","Looking at changes in mill costs, the most significant increase was wood with costs up compared to both the first quarter of 2014 and also fourth quarter driven by weather conditions. Our Tomahawk, Wisconsin and Filer City, Michigan wood costs are higher primarily as a result of extremely wet weather during the second half of 2014 that did not allow us to significantly build our winter wood inventories.","Wet weather at our Valdosta, Georgia mill and four weeks of snow, ice and rain, at our Counce, Tennessee mill in the first quarter, limited harvesting and drove up wood costs. Last week, there were record setting rainfalls in the south and the 90-day forecast caused for wetter than normal rainfall which could continue to impact harvesting and keep wood prices higher.","At this time, we do not see wood costs coming down from the first quarter levels. We expect any improvement in wood costs at our Northern mills to be offset by higher wood cost at our Southern mills unless weather conditions improve significantly.","I'll now turn it over to Tom, who will provide more details on PCA's containerboard and corrugated packaging sales and demand.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President-Corrugated Products","Thanks, Mark. Shipments for the combined PCA and Boise box plants were up 4.4% with one less work day compared to the first quarter of last year and total shipments were up 2.7%. Price and mix was down $0.03 per share, which was comprised of $0.02 per share in export linerboard and $0.01 per share for domestic, medium, and corrugated products mix taken together. Our outside sales for containerboard were up about 15,000 tons compared to last year's first quarter with domestic containerboard sales down 4,000 tons and exports up 19,000 tons.","I will now turn it over to Judy Lassa, who will discuss white papers.","Judith M. Lassa - Senior Vice President-Paper","Thank you, Tom. Paper segment EBITDA in the first quarter of 2015 increased to $49 million on sales of $297 million compared to first quarter 2014 EBITDA of $40 million in sales of $309 million.","Our office paper shipment, which represent about 70% of our volume were up about 400 tons compared to last year's first quarter. And printing and converting and pressure-sensitive shipments were down 5,500 tons compared to last year. Prices were down compared to last year's first quarter as a result of price changes by industry publications, which were retroactive to January 1 and also a less rich mix, which is driven by the timing of customer orders.","Despite lower price and changes in mix, our earnings and margins improved as we benefited from operational improvements in synergy realization in our white paper mill. Annual maintenance outages are planned in June at our International Falls, Minnesota mill for nine days and the No. 3 machine for seven days. With these outages, we expect lower mill production, higher mill cost, and lower sales volumes in the second quarter compared to the first quarter.","Also, on April 14, at our Jackson, Alabama mill, a severe thunderstorm caused a power failure and total mill outage, resulting in significant damage to the steam turbine drive for the No. 1 paper machine. This machine produces about 325 tons per day of specialty office papers, including colors, and is expected to be down about two weeks. The total cost of the outage including repairs, production losses and additional operating costs will be covered under our property and business interruption insurance subject to a $3 million deductible, or $0.02 per share.","I will now turn it over to Rick West.","Richard B. West - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Judy. Looking at other costs, medical costs were up $0.04 per share over last year's unusually low first quarter costs, and labor and benefit costs were up $0.04 per share, primarily from annual wage increases and higher pension expense. Energy costs were lower by $0.06 per share due to both lower purchased fuel prices and reduced consumption. And chemical costs were down by $0.02 per share.","Moving to first quarter, cash generation and uses. Cash generated from operations was $108 million, including a $4 million interest rebate payment on a portion of our bank debt, reducing first quarter interest expense. No additional rebate payments are expected until the first quarter of 2016.","Uses of cash included capital expenditures of $56 million, common stock dividends of $39 million, income tax payments of $10 million, share repurchases of $8 million, and a scheduled term loan payment of $2 million. We ended the quarter with $126 million in cash on hand.","Also in February, we announced an increase in PCA's common stock dividend from an annual payout of $1.60 per share to $2.20 per share, a 38% increase effective with the April 15 dividend payment.","Finally, we do not have anything new to report on MLPs, except that the IRS lifted the pause on issuing private letter rulings and we are awaiting their further actions. I'll now turn it back over to Mark.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Rick. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect earnings improvement from a full quarter of operations at the DeRidder mill, which will increase containerboard production and lower mill costs. We also expect seasonally higher containerboard and corrugated products shipment, and some weather related cost improvements. These items taken together are expected to improve earnings by about $0.11 per share. We also expect lower wage related benefit cost of about $0.02 per share.","Cost from annual mill maintenance outages, including amortization of repair cost will be $0.01 per share higher than the first quarter. We also expect a higher tax rate of $0.01 per share, higher depreciation expense of $0.01 per share and the insurance deductible from the Jackson turbine drive failure on No. 1 machine of $0.02 per share.","Finally, we will not receive the earnings benefits from state tax credits and the interest rebate in the second quarter, which together totaled $0.06 per share. Considering these items, we currently expect second quarter earnings of $1.03 per share. To put the $1.03 per share in perspective, I think it might be helpful to bridge the last year second quarter earnings of $1.16 per share.","Based on current prices and expected changes in mix, earnings are expected to be $0.16 per share lower as follows; $0.09 per share in white papers price and mix, $0.03 per share in export linerboard prices, and $0.04 per share for medium price and corrugated products mix.","Costs are expected to be $0.10 per share higher in total for wood, freight, labor and benefits and medical. In addition, annual outage costs are expected to be $0.04 higher, and the cost for our insurance deductible for the Jackson turbine drive is expected to be $0.02 per share. Taken together, these items lower earnings by $0.32 per share.","Partially offsetting these items are projected higher volume of $0.09 per share, which includes additional production from the D3 machine at DeRidder, and lower cost of $0.10 per share for chemicals, energy, recycled fiber, and other cost items, or a total benefit from these items of $0.19 per share.","With that, we'll be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constitute forward-looking statements.

Go ahead with the first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Chip Dillon from Vertical Research.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good morning.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Chip.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","First question is on \u2013 kind of shifting gears a little bit, could you just update us where we are in the process for the uncoated free sheet duties that I think you guys are involved in a petition with the Department of Commerce and my understanding is that there, the next, I guess, date is in June, but could you just update us on that? And it seems like that the preliminary determination from the ITC was, if I read it correctly, was pretty prohibitive in terms of hundreds of percent of duties they'd have to post if they can, if certain people kept sending white paper into the U.S.?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I'm going to let Kent answer that one.","Kent A. Pflederer - Secretary, Senior Vice President & General Counsel","Yes. Hi, this is Kent Pflederer, General Counsel of the company. We received a favorable preliminary ruling from the ITC in March in the case. The case is pending through Commerce right now against the producers in the five countries. Commerce is expected to make preliminary duty determinations in June, that's about all we're going to say about it at this point.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Got you. And then, shifting gears \u2013 looking at DeRidder, obviously, this was the first full quarter that I believe the D3 conversion had been up and running and could you just talk a little bit about whether you are satisfied with the design of this reconfigured machine and what you feel about the progresses made so far?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Speaking of where we are, I want to remind everyone that when we originally conceived the conversion, the machine was intended originally to produce primarily medium. Early on we recognized the opportunities that we could actually produce linerboard and take advantage of the pulp that was available. So we shifted gears into the end of last year and to the first part of this year with lot of grade development and fine tuning the machine. So, quite honestly we're very pleased. The machine is primarily producing about 70% of its production at linerboard, but again we've learned a lot and we've achieved a lot. We've been working on the cost, but again it's machine that can produce quite a variety of grades from the light weight medium and liner and take advantage of the pulp mill. Paul, do you want to expand on it?","Paul T. Stecko - Non-Executive Chairman","Yeah, the only thing I'd add to that, Chip and Mark hit it, but I'll just amplify it. Most of these new spring conversions are somewhat limited, if they could only run pretty light weight grade mix, and with the things we did on the machine, we were figuring originally we'd probably run 70% medium, 30% liner. But some of the things have turned out better than we anticipated, a lot better, which is a testament through our technology and our people and we can make higher weight grades than we originally thought we could. And with the fact that the open market price of medium is now $70 over the liner and we can move up in higher basis weights, that gave us the opportunity in our system to make a lot more liner than we originally conceived.","Now that's the good news. The bad news is, it takes some time, there are harder grades to develop on the machine, but we're well along on that development. And as Mark said, we're making well over half of our production now, in medium \u2013 in linerboard and that's going to pay dividends long term. So, that's one of the reasons that we're not quite up the capacity. We need a little more drying because of the heavier weight grade mix and during the annual outage, not annual outage, during a short outage we're going to take in September, we're going to put in four more dryer cans, which is at a minimal cost and we think we'll be at 100% when we do that on a much heavier grade mix.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Got you. That's helpful. And just as a quick follow-up to that. I know that when you all did the D3, I believe we were talking about $115 million, $120 million project that was going to create around $60 million in EBITDA on an annualized basis. And it sounds to me you still see yourselves getting there. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it's more like late in the year after the driers go in. And so when we think about the second quarter, with the $1.03, what kind of run rate would you say the project would achieve in the second quarter versus that $60 million target?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Without getting specific, we did a lot of work in the first quarter and also with the fact that March was truly an annual shutdown at the mill, which skews all of your input costs, and so even though D3 ran during the month, it wouldn't have been a normal comparison in terms of cost per ton produced. But again, we've been able to achieve a number of successes with the chemistry that would qualify to hit the target. Capital, we're probably going to be right at that $120 million all in. And as we said, we expected the $0.36 per share contribution. As time goes on, we fully expect to see that, again part of this year, the first quarter, we have that contribution that was impacted by the March annual outage. So we're more backend loaded, but what Paul just said and what I said about the success of the machine, we expect it to be there.","Paul T. Stecko - Non-Executive Chairman","Yeah. Chip, just hang on \u2013 this is Paul. The only thing I'd add, the way the accounting system works here, we don't split the cost of No. 1 machine and No. 3 machine. We basically measure mill profitability and then we estimate what we think the costs are in both machines. And so it's not an exact science at this point. But I would say this, when you bring a machine, when you ramp up, you do two things. You get the machine up total capacity. And once you do that and at the same time, you try to work to optimize cost, because as you learn, you build in a lot of conservatism, the run on a machine with regard to chemicals and things of that nature. So you've got to do two things: you got to get up to speed and you got to optimize the costs. And we've complicated that a little bit by going to a more complex mix, but that's going to pay long-term dividends.","And then the other thing you have to \u2013 we're running about 800 tons out of 1,000 tons, but when you get up to 1,000 tons, that brings your costs down a lot too, because those last 200 tons cover all your fixed costs, covers all your direct costs, they've already been covered. So you're going to get a nice bump on that. But our best estimate at this point is that by the end of the second quarter, we'll have a full quarter operation of that machine. We said originally this machine could make $0.09 a share when it was up to speed per quarter. So that's 36% a year. I think by the end of the second quarter, and this is a guess on our part, we think we'll be about halfway there. And that's the best way we can answer the question.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","That's very helpful.","Paul T. Stecko - Non-Executive Chairman","When we get up to speed and the new grade mix, I think we got some upside potential to those original numbers, but that remains to be seen.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And Chip, just adding to that, and I commented on the first quarter earnings call, I believe the DeRidder No. 3 machine is, to our knowledge, the only converted newsprint machine producing virgin linerboard grades and so we are quite pleased with that. But also knowing what we know about the cost at our other legacy mills, we are very pleased with where we are in the total input cost on wetting chemicals and energy conversion costs on machine now that we've come through this first quarter. So, again, with the shutdown behind us and as the year rolls on, we feel very confident with where we are with the machine.","Paul T. Stecko - Non-Executive Chairman","And we've learned a lot. I mean, this has been a tough startup, it's a lot of new technology for us, and we've learned a lot and we think we'll apply that going forward.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Next question please?","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you. I appreciate that color on what's going on at DeRidder, that's very helpful and better understanding. And just two quick follow-ups on that. Will hopefully most of that $0.36 be achievable by 2016 with some of the additional work you are doing at the end of this year, or might it take even a little bit longer than that to get to those targets?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, we're very confident again with what was accomplished in the \u2013 all of the chemistry fine-tuning. Now that the mill is back running and we're coming through getting the mill lined up, we feel comfortable that that's achievable through the course of the year.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President-Corrugated Products","And Mark, just to amplify on that, as Mark said earlier, we thought we'd run primarily medium, 23-pound, and then when we got into it, we were amazed at how high we could get the basis weight. That's why we didn't put in those extra driers. There is spots for four more driers in the machine where there was an old breaker stack we removed. But our theory has been, don't spend the money unless you think you have to. We didn't think we have to at the beginning, but we didn't realize that we'd have this opportunity on heavy weight liner either. So when we popped those four driers in, in September, we're going to feel pretty good about getting where we need to get by the end of the year for certain.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. That's very helpful. So presumably, when you say you are at the end of the second quarter, you'll be at halfway, that means during the second quarter, you are at that level or lower so we have a lot more yet to come once all this is put in place.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President-Corrugated Products","Correct.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And then if we were to try and assess Boise synergies, second quarter versus the year ago, could you give us a sense of how much benefit you are seeing there and what the progression or the trajectory on the Boise synergies has been as maybe there's \u2013 has there been anything that's made that to come in a little bit more slowly or a bit more quickly than you might have been thinking coming into this year?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Rick, why don't you go ahead and address that?","Richard B. West - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Last year, Mark, there was a lot of synergies upfront that we were able to take, probably in the first three months, with the corporate overhead, that was in place. We also were able to significantly improve the earnings in the white papers business, absent price dramatically in the last year with all of the improvements made at the mills, et cetera.","In the Boise converting side of the business, Tom and his team was able to take certain actions across all of the plants. It's a little bit more of a in-depth longer process to optimizing the Boise converting plants than in the paper mills, which are more evident upfront.","But to put the numbers somewhat in perspective, and I think this is what we want to get across the synergies that we achieved last year and that what we are achieving now are offsetting the inflation and the price difference year-over-year. We gave the bridge from the first quarter year-over-year and the second quarter year-over-year. But if you look at what we made in the first half of last year, it was a total of $2.24 per share.","If you look at what we have in price differences and mix in the first quarter and then add to that what we had in the bridge for the second quarter for how much earnings has dropped as a result of price and mix, that's $0.23 per share. Then compare to the first half of last year, annual outage costs, which would include having DeRidder this year and no outage last year for the entire year, was a $0.12 hit compared to the first half of last year.","So combining price and annual outages alone before any synergies and we did have synergies in the first half of last year, so I said earlier what we achieved upfront, we would be at $1.89 per share of our earnings. So what we've been able to achieve were the synergies that we are continuing to get and what we got last year is to offset that $1.89 to come back to our guidance of $2.04 with synergies being partially offset by inflation. And we said inflation \u2013 for the year, we said that \u2013 we expect that to be 1% or 2% of cost of sale. So, the synergies are coming through, but in the first half of the year it's the fact that the outages were more with DeRidder and we've had the significant impact of price and mix.","Paul T. Stecko - Non-Executive Chairman","And Mark, this is Paul. Just to add to that. What we said is that we achieved 100 tons in the first year and we expected a total of 200 tons, so that's another 100 tons to come. But we said we'd get that over the next two years, because they were not quick hits like head count reduction where we got basically $30 million, $35 million in corporate overhead up right away. A good example of that is we have been working at DeRidder to increase pulp-making capacity, because that's a pulp limited mill and it's taken us a year, but we feel we're about to the point where we think we can produce another 300 tons of pulp a day. I have a pulp mill, which again is the synergy that's baked into our numbers.","The complicating thing, and I don't want to make this too complicated, is how do you evaluate what's the value of 300 tons. Well, today the value of 300 tons comes from the fact that you could buy less OCC, and you eliminate your highest OCC, you also can make more linerboard because you got more virgin fiber.","So right now, the price between liner and medium, open market, is about $50 to $70, that's a synergy, but the real big bang for the synergy is if you improve the productivity at DeRidder over the next couple of years, and increase its capacity and sell those tons, you're talking $250 a ton or so in synergies. So some of the synergy numbers you get, you get a bump upfront but then you get a bigger bump later when you get a better use for what you've created. So it's a fairly complex thing.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Another example that capital contribution is the IFalls turbine generator that will come online, again, that's a distinct capital project that we identified well over a year ago, that will be coming up in September, but that again is a significant example.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Helpful. And so and recognizing it's very complicated, if we were to think of where we are on that $200 million targeted run rate, say, in the first half of 2015, are we closer to the $120 million range now, or we might be closer to the $160 million range, just trying to see the pace of how we go from that $100 million to $200 million?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Anything I'd say would be speculative of \u2013 let's say \u2013 it's back-end loaded. We're confident that the numbers are there. So as the year goes on, there will be falling to the point bottom line, but again, with all the shutdown activity and then with distinct project related contributions, it's really difficult to try to quantify that.","Paul T. Stecko - Non-Executive Chairman","And, Mark, when you got machine down, when you're down at DeRidder for basically 22 days in a month, you don't get any synergies when you are down. So we need to get up, we need to get our system up and running before we could put together our estimates that are what you are talking about. So we're going to have to wait a while before we do that, but we'll certainly talk about it on our next earnings call. We'll have it hopefully a full quarter of steady operations on the containerboard side of the business behind us.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And also when we said, back at the end of last year that by the end of 2016, we expect to achieve the extra 100 ton. Another item, the end of this year, we'll be taking Jackson Mill down, another capital project that we have slated into the capital this year was the rebuild of the recovery boiler that was badly needed. So, that's two examples between the turbine at IFalls and the rebuild of the recovery boiler that will contribute nicely to these efficiencies.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thanks very much.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Next question. Next question, please.","Operator","Next, we have Mark Wilde from Bank of Montreal.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Judy, I wondered if you can talk a little bit about sort of interplay of price and mix, because you identified both of them, but you do it together and I wondered if you could particularly talk about sort of the mix side of things and the impact of that and also the impact of foreign exchange right now as you see it in the white paper business.","Judith M. Lassa - Senior Vice President-Paper","And are you talking first quarter?","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yes. First quarter, if there is going to be \u2013 if you foresee any changes as we move into the second quarter?","Judith M. Lassa - Senior Vice President-Paper","Certainly. If you look at the price and mix piece for first quarter, again, the cut size index is down about $10 per ton, which we have a lot of index business which we've mentioned before. And then, within that office business, we had a pretty big swing in commodity versus premium mix. So that's a big piece of it right there. The P&C, our printing and converting index is also down by about $20 and offset that has impacted us. Pulp price is down as well and this will impact both quarters, it's about $50 domestically down in RISI (35:44) and about $70 to China.","And then, if you look at our entire business mix, office is about flat in first quarter, we are down about 5,500 tons, like we said, in P&C and pressure sensitive, not too much in P&C. The pressure sensitive is driven heavily by the fact that last year we were still shipping products out of inventory from IFalls to our customer. I mean, also we've had some impact of internationally of the port slowdown that we're still working through.","If you look at Q2 it's actually more of the same. Again, the cut-size index is dropping about $25 per ton. We expect that we still have a higher commodity mix within that business. Offset is going to be down, year-over-year $20 a ton. We also have a mixed within our printing and converting business such that we have more offset than envelope business and so that it takes a little bit of a price away as well.","And the pressure sensitive side of things in Q2. We have couple of new contracts that are going to impact us in Q2, which are down in price, and also it's been very price competitive in South America. Again, pulp is going to hit us with the $50 domestically and $10 to China, and again overall business mix is going to be more printing and converting, we basically use that as a flex grade to balance our asset, less pressure sensitive, we do have some more comp against last year as far as selling out of inventory on the IFalls grade, and then we have a little bit more pulp.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And, Judy, can you just expand a little bit on what you just said about Latin America? Is that a currency related issue is you said?","Judith M. Lassa - Senior Vice President-Paper","Yeah. I did. like I said, our currency as well is pretty competitive, I mean, it's one of the higher margin areas of business and there have been a lot of, again, because of currency a lot of exposure from Europe in there.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. All right. And then Tom Hassfurther, any thoughts on sort of how you're seeing kind of converting volumes across the country relative to expectations both from the first quarter and as you move into the second quarter?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President-Corrugated Products","Mark, I can just really comment on what PCA has done. And....","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. It's all I'm asking.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President-Corrugated Products","Yeah. Coming out of the first quarter, of course, our numbers were good in spite of the fact we were very much impacted by weather especially in the South and the North East where we have a large footprint.","Looking at just April and I gave you an indication of what's happening so far in April. For the first time shipping days, PCA legacy box plants, bookings are up about 7.5%, shipments are up about 4.2%. Now, keep in mind, on the shipment side, Good Friday did fall early in April and we did have a number of plants working on Good Friday. So the shipment number maybe just a touch high. Now, of course, the Boise box plant represents about 20% of our shipment and they're not in our numbers yet. Beginning in May we'll have those fully converted to the PCA systems. So, we'll have daily data starting in May and we'll be able to update you much better starting in July of this year. But overall, we're off to a good start. And so, I think, demand remains very steady.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And can you give us any sense Tom on what you're seeing in terms of just export conditions, say where we're today versus where we were during the first quarter?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President-Corrugated Products","Well, I think exports still remains good. I mean, it remained strong. In terms of our opportunities, we do have some currency headwinds of course and seeing some pricing variances around the world but RISI (39:33) just announced Europe was up 25%, that's a positive.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Your volume is mainly in export, mainly SKUs to Latin America, is that right?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President-Corrugated Products","It's Latin America, South America primarily, yeah.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. All right. Last question I had is just wood costs. I just wonder in the Southern U.S., is there any impact from these pellet plants, which have been opening up? Is that, in addition to weather, incrementally putting any pressure on fiber costs?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Mark. We've seen definitely the trend over the last couple of years that the pellet plants, particularly in southeast have been a competitor within the wood basket, so you combine that with wet weather and the overall harvest conditions. So, it definitely has put pressure on the ability to distribute that wood out of those wood baskets into the traditional mill needs.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Very good. I'll turn it over. Thanks.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Anthony Pettinari from Citigroup \u2013 excuse me, our next question is from George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details. I guess, I want to try one more crack at the bridge-type question specific to the packaging segment to the extent that you can answer, any of the details will be appreciated. So when we look at the $20 million reduction year-on-year in EBITDA, would it be safe to say that roughly half of that was the variance in maintenance outage expense versus first quarter 2014, the rest was the price mix issues that you enumerated and that the various cost factors, labor cost, wood cost, energy and so on were more or less a wash, just trying to put in bigger buckets if that's possible. And, you didn't get much synergy because of the fact that you were down so much in the first quarter. Would that be a fair summary of the packaging segment?","Richard B. West - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, it would, Mark (sic) [George]. If you look at last year, we had about $0.07 per share in annual outage costs and that was all in the paper mills and then we had $0.08 per share more this year, which would equate back to about $12 million. Then you got the second item would be, what you said with export containerboard prices, plus inflation, and I would point out especially in our packaging side and legacy, we have an unusually low medical cost in first quarter last year and just in that side alone, we were up about $6 million in medical. So you're correct in what you've said about the drop and that also applies to going from 4Q to 1Q, I think you had read where the drop was. We made about $250 million in 4Q and you take off the annual outage cost from that, it was an incremental $12 million off of that. So that's the key bucket and you're correct in your assumptions.","Paul T. Stecko - Non-Executive Chairman","And George, this is Paul, a little bit of technicolor around that number. We did not have an outage at DeRidder last year. We had our huge outage this year, fixed a lot of things that needed fixed for a long time. And when we look at our \u2013 in total maintenance cost, outage cost year-over-year, including amortization, loss production etcetera, we're going to be up year-over-year, because the addition of the Valdosta outage -","Richard B. West - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","DeRidder outage.","Paul T. Stecko - Non-Executive Chairman","Excuse me, because of the DeRidder outage, we're going to be up $0.11 year-over-year and of that $0.11, DeRidder is $0.13 and they hit all in their first half of the year.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay. So, Paul thanks for that. Rick thanks for that. So, you segue to my next question which is as we try to again bridge given that there are number of moving pieces, I remember that last year if our maintenance expense was roughly $0.48. So, we're running then, if I take that $0.11 closer to $0.59, $0.60 year-on-year would you confirm that and then assuming normal operations, I know there is no way to define normal, but we'll give it a shot. Is there a way to take a crack at what the maintenance expense might look like in 2016 versus 2015?","Richard B. West - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, I will take the first shot, from the standpoint of where we're at right now, for total annual outage costs, this is Rick West...","George L. Staphos - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Hey, Rick.","Richard B. West - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Annual outage volume loss is direct expenses and repair amortization. The numbers in the first quarter will be $0.15 a share, in the second quarter $0.16 per share. It drops down to only basically $0.085 per share in the third quarter because we have very \u2013 of the only outage we have in the third quarter is on the D3 machine a short outage to replace the dryers. So, then in the fourth quarter, it goes back up to $0.19 per share because you have to add additional outages in the fourth quarter that we have planned plus all the remaining repair job amortization. So, that should equate to a total for the year up $0.59 per share.","Now, we have not done anything to really look at 2016, this year for example, we don't have the Valdosta outage, next year we will have to have a Valdosta outage in one of the quarters, but in terms of trying to determine at an annual outage cost, it's going to be a moving target based upon what we have to take each year, but I would say the DeRidder outage, which is by far probably our most expensive outage, especially with the extended part of it, would cause you to probably have \u2013 and I don't want to speculate to the any extent, but I would think that it's going to be a little bit lighter than next year.","Paul T. Stecko - Non-Executive Chairman","Just adding some color to that. Through the course of last year, we've recognized these opportunities at DeRidder. And if you go back to the legacy history of PCA, we decided based on the fact that we understood what we needed to do. We have the manpower to do with the technical resources. We identified number of these opportunities that historically if you went back into a Counce mill or Valdosta, we took a number of years to correct. We corrected in this one outage in March, a number of items that probably would have taken five years worth of outages 10 years ago in our legacy business.","So we accomplished a great deal. We took on a great deal, but it's behind us theoretically. And so, that's where we'll obviously get the benefits, but again, if anything going forward is speculative next year in terms of what cost would be.","Richard B. West - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And just to qualify what Rick said on Valdosta, with the energy project at Valdosta, and other things we've done, we have been able now to go to an annual outage every year and a half instead of every year and so that's why Valdosta has one year, but then it skips, and so you work to a year-and-a-half and that's the reason there is no Valdosta shutdown next year.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Paul, I will turn it over here, but would an average Valdosta be $0.06 a share roughly in a year?","Paul T. Stecko - Non-Executive Chairman","Not sure. Well, we don't want just throw a number out right now, George.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Understood.","Richard B. West - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Probably closer to a nickel than $0.06.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you, guys. Good luck in the quarter.","Paul T. Stecko - Non-Executive Chairman","Thanks. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Anthony Pettinari from Citigroup.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Anthony.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Just to follow-up on George's question. If we take your 2Q guidance, your first-half earnings are down year-over-year by about $0.20, as you look into the back-half of the year, assuming flat product prices, would you expect earnings to be flat or higher or lower versus the second-half of last year, and I understand you don't give full year guidance, but with DeRidder ramping up and some of these synergies flowing through and lower maintenance outages in 3Q. Is there a reason to think that second-half earnings wouldn't be higher year-over-year versus last year?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Again, sticking to tradition, we only give guidance one quarter at a time, so I'm not going to speculate.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, okay. And regarding the vendor design errors, is there an insurance recovery associated with that? Are you seeking compensation from the vendor? And then, regarding the dryer installation is there any incremental CapEx on that in the second half of the year, and can you just refresh our view on full year CapEx?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","On your first question, we've been working with the vendor to obviously correct what needs to be corrected and so rather than get into any legalities or implications there, I'd rather not comment. But again, we're confident that we've been able to rectify the problems that we encountered in a timely manner and take care of the machine.","And the second part of your question, refresh my memory \u2013 yeah, cost of the dryer; that was baked into the capital when we said $275 million to $300 million. So, that's not additional capital.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. And just a last one, how much free cash did you generate in this quarter?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Rick.","Richard B. West - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, we generated cash from operations of $109 million and we had $56 million in CapEx, so about $55 million.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful.","Richard B. West - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And I'll just point out, this is a quarter where we have a lot of working capital hits in the first quarter, and our cash...","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Right.","Richard B. West - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","...generally gets better through the rest of the year.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Right. Okay, that's helpful. I'll turn it over.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Alex Ovshey from Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning, guys.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I wanted to go back to the input costs side. We didn't really talk about freight. So diesel prices are down very materially year-over-year. Are you not seeing any benefit of the decline in diesel prices on your business?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","The issue has been not just the diesel costs, but it's been the availability of truck and rail, and obviously rail rates haven't been coming down. And truck rates, because of the demand for the truck fleet that's available in this country, prices have remained high and are going higher because they have the ability to command price in terms of the trucking industry. So even though diesel's come down, in general we're not seeing the benefit of it.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it, Mark. And maybe thinking about the balance of the year, is it fair to think about freight as more of a push on the cost side?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's just, yeah, speculative on my part. So I really don't want to comment.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then, just going back to D3, wanted to clarify a couple of things that you said. So you said you'd be running at about 80% of the stated annual capacity in the second quarter?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","We are actually \u2013 we've run at the 80% rate year-to-date and, obviously, part of that was because again we made the conscious decision to shift the machine over to predominantly linerboard machine. And so the drying rates are a little more demanding in terms of the heavier weight mix we have on the machine. So we'll probably be in this 80% range until we add dryers in the September outage to take advantage of the incremental dryer opportunity.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Understood. And so the mix currently right now is about 70% linerboard and 30% medium?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Correct. That's a good number.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, got you. Very helpful. And then, last question. So on the export side, can you just remind us again what your export position is, kind of a rough number of how many tons you expect to put into the export market on an annual basis and how that breaks out between the different regions around the world?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I'm not going to break out the various regions, Alex, but I will say that we're about 5% export, so it's a fairly small piece of our total revenue and total output. We are more concentrated in Latin America and South America, and Asia to some extent and less in Europe, but that's kind of \u2013 that's about the best color I can add to that for you.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President-Corrugated Products","Yeah, let me just clarify that a little bit. It's around 5% of our tonnage, but since paper sells for, pick a rough number, half of what a box costs, it's really only 2.5% or 3% of our sales.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, okay. Thanks for everybody's input. I'll turn it over.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Connelly from CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Two questions. First, Tom, are you making any significant changes in your existing box plant converting capacity to accommodate the new D3 volumes or should we expect you to be spending some money there? I'm just wondering how much your existing system can handle of new tonnage. And second, a question for Judy. Does the decline in tonnage in white paper help or hurt margins? I'm just trying to get a sense to \u2013 it's specialty volume that was lost, but then you have the offset of the purchased pulp.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President-Corrugated Products","Mark, this is Tom. I'll take the first question. Let me remind you that we have been purchasing outside 200,000 tons. So...","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Right.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President-Corrugated Products","...the D3 output will go into our box plants and that's why it's so vitally important that we were able to produce linerboard as opposed to just lightweight mediums, because that's where the important need is in our box plants and, of course, in the conversion process you use two liners to every one medium. So we will absorb this D3 output right into our box plants as a result of the outside tonnage that we currently purchase and the growth rates that we've had on a pretty consistent basis.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. So that rebalancing process is more or less eliminating the issue for you?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President-Corrugated Products","Right.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President-Corrugated Products","Well, it's eliminating the issue of having outside purchases.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Right, exactly.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President-Corrugated Products","And being able to consume internally, yes.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Right. Perfect. Okay.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Again in the first quarter, we did not purchase any outside tonnage except for specialty grades, which is what we've traditionally done.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Perfect. Okay.","Judith M. Lassa - Senior Vice President-Paper","Okay. So the second half, if I understand your question correctly, it's around the impact of pressure-sensitive and market pulp on the margin. If you look at it, the pressure sensitive is a pretty small business. And so it's not a huge \u2013 it does \u2013 I mean, like I said, it does take the margins down a little bit as well as pulp, but again it just kind of piles on to the bigger \u2013 what's going on in office.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. So on balance, it was probably a net positive overall then, just those two items, right?","Judith M. Lassa - Senior Vice President-Paper","Yeah, yeah, yeah.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Next question, please?","Operator","Next we have Philip Ng from Jefferies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. You've highlighted export prices as a headwind. How much of that is tied to you selling more tons into the export market post-D3, or is that just a function for the erosion in export prices? And ultimately, what are you guys baking in into your 2Q guidance for export prices?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President-Corrugated Products","Well, again, we're not \u2013 the D3 production is staying within our own system. So that is not being produced for export. So where we are in terms of any export\/domestic sales is just balancing out our system quarter-to-quarter.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President-Corrugated Products","Mark, do you have anything to add to that?","Richard B. West - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No, I don't have anything to add, no.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then can you provide some color more on the mix headwind that you guys called out? It's a bit more pronounced than I would have expected.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Rick, go ahead.","Richard B. West - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I don't \u2013 I think Judy, in terms of price and mix, we calculate it all together. When we gave the numbers in the bridge, $0.09 per share year-over-year in white papers and Judy explained all the components, and then we gave $0.03 in export liner prices year-over-year in 2Q. And then in domestic medium and corrugated products mix, we had $0.04 per share, which gave us a total in 2Q to 2Q, and then you had the amount in the bridge, Phil, for the first quarter. So it's a combination of price and mix; it's predominantly more price than mix, but it's \u2013 in general, it's been through the different product lines that Judy expanded upon in white papers.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Got you. I mean on the corrugated and medium side, I guess it was \u2013 it is a big \u2013 larger hit than I would have expected since most of your business is integrated. So were there any dynamics, just the way you're selling in terms of boxes or is it just a function of more \u2013 I'm just curious, because it seems to be more pronounced than I would have expected, the white paper part, I could appreciate it.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Phil, it's just more a function of when the specialty products happen to ship in a particular quarter, something like that. So it was a little lighter in the first quarter than in comparison to the same timeframe a year ago. So it's just more timing more than anything else. It's a small number. Medium, obviously, those published prices dropped, now up to $20, so \u2013 and as Paul alluded to earlier, there is quite a spread now between liner and medium. So that's a larger portion of the $0.04 that Rick's talked about.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And I guess I'll just take a crack at what Anthony was trying to parse out earlier. I mean if you \u2013 can you help us frame what the headwinds \u2013 how much of the headwinds that you saw in the first half would dissipate in the back half? And I'd appreciate, a big chunk of that to D3, weather and then perhaps adjusting for maintenance, but can you kind of help us quantify what can roll off in the back half?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, it's \u2013 again it's too speculative.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","No problem. And just one last one for me, then I guess on capital employment. I appreciate you guys raised your dividend. Historically, you guys have been very opportunistic when your stock sells off. Do you kind of viewed the recent pullback as buying opportunity, how should we be thinking about stock buybacks this year?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, again, we talked before CapEx, acquisitions, dividends, and share buybacks, so again those are \u2013 it remains those four talking points. So, again, we'll consider all of that and that's generally a board matter.","Paul T. Stecko - Non-Executive Chairman","Just to amplify on the dividend, because we did announce a dividend increase. We thought in this low yield environment that we're in, that yield would be important to our investors, because it's \u2013 you get that while you wait for better things to happen if you will. And so, we think having a good yield to import and then our story on share buybacks has never changed. We tend to remain opportunistic in share buyback and if something happens in a world like group debt causes things to happen that we don't think should affect us, that could create a buying opportunity and we've been fairly successful in doing that over the past three years or four years. And we're going to continue that sort of philosophy as opposed to just steadily buying a little bit every day.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks for that.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Next question. We'll take one more question if anybody has anything.","Operator","Next, we have Al Kabili from Macquarie.","Al Kabili - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up and that we really appreciate the bridge that you laid out. You did in the second quarter really explicitly talk about the synergies year-over-year. Are you netting those synergy benefits against inflation so that underlying inflations actually higher than what you have in that bridge? I'm just trying to understand where the synergies fit in the second quarter bridge that you highlighted to us. Thanks.","Richard B. West - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Al, this is Rick West. You're absolutely correct. Our accounting systems don't allow us to really bridge the two, some you can, but you're definitely right. If had there not been synergies and that's what I alluded to when I did the first half of the year comparison, the bridge numbers would have been worse. So there is an embedded benefit of synergies in those numbers.","Al Kabili - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. I appreciate that Rick, that helps. And then just my last or follow-on question is just on DeRidder and it sounds like we're at 80% production. We are at well below that in terms of expected run rate to full earnings. So is this just higher costs until you optimize it and where, specifically, you mentioned the dryers, but again just bridging the gap between the 80% production levels and the earnings contribution, where that gap really lies and again confirming that you think you're going to get there at the end of the year?","Paul T. Stecko - Non-Executive Chairman","Well, again, if you go back to a normal startup curve on the paper machine or any paper machine whether it's a new machine or a converted machine, first quarter, we're still on the curve of learning, but also when we shift to the grade mix, significantly to liner, liner inherently has a higher input cost wetting chemicals, et cetera. And so, we very quickly were able to address the input cost, chemicals and so, again, we feel going forward we have a very competitive cost position, but I think you also said there's inflation at play. And so, inflation is there, but just summarizing, we feel confident the machine is going to contribute what we've been saying and it's more back end loaded obviously.","Richard B. West - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","But, let me just add to that. You're right on cost. Our costs are higher than they will be when we optimize, but don't forget the thing that I mentioned earlier on the call, we're running at 80% of capacity. The last 20% that we get is probably has a cost of $150 a ton lower than the first 80%, because all your fixed costs have already been absorbed, all your labor is already been absorbed. So as last 20%, the cost is really low and that will bring down your costs a lot because the incremental margin is so high, because you've already absorbed all these other costs on the first 80%. And then, in the meantime, as we develop these grades and learn to make them better, the costs are coming down. But you're right, our costs are disproportionately high to the production rate because of the reasons I just gave you.","Al Kabili - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. That's really helpful. I appreciate that. Okay, last question for Judy. Just on the white paper side, the office papers, you guys markedly outperformed the industry in the first quarter, and I wondered if you could talk to that and sort of \u2013 if that outperformance you think is sustainable?","Judith M. Lassa - Senior Vice President-Paper","So (1:05:36) shipment piece of the office papers business, we have just seen strong performance with our key customers and we'll continue with those key customers and hope to see that going throughout the year.","Al Kabili - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. All right. But, I mean, any sense of just that level of outperformance, Judy, like you said being up in a down market is pretty notable. So I don't know if that's something you think you can continue to do or is there some timing variances in there?","Judith M. Lassa - Senior Vice President-Paper","So the bulk of our performance in Q1 is synergies and that will continue. And, again, from a standpoint of our strong office business, performance by our customers and we expect that to hold.","Al Kabili - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Got it.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Just to add on that, we've got a lot of synergies in a white paper business on a much smaller volume than is in the brown business. So synergies really made a big difference there because they are substantial and they're on a lot smaller business than the brown business.","Al Kabili - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. That helps. It's good to see. All right. Thanks and good luck.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. With that, operator, the time is up, and thank everybody for joining us today, and we'll talk to you on the 2Q call in July. Thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

Your host today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chief Executive Officer of PCA. Upon conclusion of his narrative, there will be a Q&A session.","I will now turn the conference call over to Mr. Kowlzan. And please proceed when you are ready.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, and thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's third quarter 2015 earnings release conference call. I'm Mark Kowlzan, CEO of PCA. And with me on the call today are Paul Stecko, our Chairman; Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs our Packaging business; Judy Lassa, Senior Vice President who runs our White Papers business; Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer.","During our prepared comments, we will be referring to slides that are posted on our website. I'll begin the call with a through review of our third quarter results and operations. And then I'll turn the call over to Tom, Judy, and Bob who'll provide more details. I'll wrap things up, and then we'll be glad to take questions.","Yesterday, we reported third quarter net income of $128 million or $1.31 per share, compared to last year's third quarter net income of $104 million, or $1.06 per share. Earnings included a $5 million, or $0.05 per share, net gain for special items related to the Boise integration, including the sale of the former St. Helens mill site previously operated by Boise Incorporated.","Excluding special items, third quarter 2015 net income was $123 million, or $1.26 per share, compared to third quarter 2014 net income of $124 million, or $1.26 per share. Third quarter net sales were $1.5 billion in both 2015 and 2014.","Turning to slide three. Third quarter 2015 earnings per share, excluding special items, were equal to the third quarter of 2014, driven by improved volume of $0.07; lower cost for chemicals, $0.03; energy, $0.03; and repairs, $0.02; and a lower tax rate, $0.03. These items were offset by lower white paper prices and mix, $0.13; lower export containerboard prices $0.03; higher fiber costs, $0.01. And we're pleased that we matched last year's record third quarter earnings considering that lower prices and mix in our Paper segment and lower export containerboard prices adversely affected earnings by $0.16 per share.","Looking at our \u2013 Packaging business, EBITDA and margins excluding special items were up over last year's levels with EBITDA of $268 million, and sales of $1.14 billion, or a 23.4% margin, compared to the third quarter of 2014 packaging EBITDA excluding special items of $262 million with sales of $1.18 billion or a 22.3% margin.","Keep in mind that third quarter 2014 revenues included over $36 million of sale that related to the discontinued newsprint business at DeRidder and other divested operations.","Containerboard production in the third quarter was 933,000 tons, up 75,000 tons compared to last year's third quarter, driven primarily by the tons produced on the D3 paper machine at DeRidder. As mentioned during last quarter's call, we took D3 down in September to install six additional dryers, in order to provide the capability to achieve full design capacity of 1,000 tons per day. The outage was executed safely and efficiently, started off ahead of schedule and achieved all objectives.","The achievement of our designed capacity objectives puts us in position to fully optimize our entire containerboard platform and improve our manufacturing and freight costs. Also, just as importantly, this allows us to respond quickly and efficiently to future growth and service our customers' needs in a timely manner.","Our containerboard inventory at the end of the third quarter was up 6,000 tons versus the second quarter levels, and about 2,000 tons above year-end 2014. As we've mentioned on previous calls, containerboard inventories at our box plants are higher than what we've carried historically due to the transportation issues that I think most of you are familiar with now.","Our containerboard mills operated very well during the quarter with energy and chemical costs lower than last year's third quarter, while fiber costs were slightly higher, primarily at our Tomahawk, Wisconsin mill.","I'll now turn it over to Tom, who'll provide more details on containerboard sales and our corrugated business.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President-Corrugated Products","Thank you, Mark. Our corrugated product shipments set a new record, up 1.3% in total and per work day over a record third quarter of last year. This compares to industry shipments, which were up 0.9%. Pricing for corrugated products during the quarter remained stable compared to both the second quarter of 2015 and the third quarter of 2014.","Our outside sales in containerboard were flat with the second quarter, and up about 12,000 tons compared to last year's third quarter, reflecting an increase in export ships. Domestic prices were comparable to the second quarter and last year's third quarter, while export prices were fairly flat with the second quarter, but about 8% lower than last year's levels.","We expect outside sales of containerboard and corrugated product shipments to be lower compared to the third quarter with three less shipping days, and some seasonal slowdown in demand that usually occurs during the Christmas holiday period.","Our corrugated products mix will be seasonally less rich in the fourth quarter as the produce business in the Pacific Northwest as well as the display in high-end graphics business for the Christmas holiday period normally falls-off during the quarter.","However, we do expect overall corrugated product volumes to be slightly higher than last year's record fourth quarter.","I'll now turn it back to Mark.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Tom. Looking at our Paper segment, EBITDA excluding special items and sales were lower compared to the third quarter of last year with EBITDA of $46 million and sales of $292 million or 15.8% margin compared to the third quarter of 2014, with EBITDA of $56 million and sales of $313 million or a 17.9% margin.","Although sales prices negatively impacted our EBITDA by almost $20 million, we were able to cut that impact in half through our cost reduction and efficiency improvement efforts. Additionally, at our International Falls mill, we also completed the successful installation and startup of a 53 megawatt turbine generator to replace four small inefficient units. With the new turbine generator, the mill is now capable of producing 70% of its electrical power requirements compared to 38% previously.","I'll now turn it over to Judy Lassa, who'll provide more operating details.","Judith M. Lassa - Senior Vice President-Paper","Thank you, Mark. The drop in revenues versus last year that Mark referred to were driven by lower prices and mix changes, while total shipments were essentially equal with last year's level. Compared to the second quarter, prices held up fairly well, dropping only slightly, and volume was up 5%.","Office paper shipments, which represent about 70% of our paper volume, were down about 1% versus last year, but up over 4% compared to the second quarter. Overall, the mills ran well during the quarter, compared to last year's third quarter; cost for wood, chemicals and energy were lower, offset slightly by higher prices for purchased pulp.","There are also improvements in maintenance costs and labor and benefit costs. We had no maintenance outages during the third quarter. But in the fourth quarter, we will have an extended recovery boiler outage at our Jackson, Alabama mill, which will reduce production by over 28,000 tons, primarily on our number three paper machine.","Also, our volumes are expected to be seasonally lower, and our mix will be less rich in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter.","I'll now turn it over to Rob Mundy.","Robert P. Mundy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Judy. As expected and mentioned during our last call, third quarter 2015 effective tax rate of 35% was the same as the second quarter, and about 1.5% below last year's third quarter. We currently expect the fourth quarter of 2015 tax rate to be similar to the third quarter at about 35%.","As shown on slide four, cash provided by operations in the third quarter was $237 million, that's after deducting $76 million in cash tax payments for federal and state income taxes, other uses of cash including the capital expenditures of $76 million, common stock dividends of $54 million, share repurchases of $55 million, and debt repayments of $27 million. We ended the quarter with $187 million cash on hand.","So year-to-date, in 2015, we paid dividends totaling $147 million, repurchased shares totaling $101 million, and we've made $31 million of debt repayments.","I'll now turn it back over to Mark.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Bob. Looking ahead, as discussed earlier, we expect seasonally lower volumes of corrugated products and containerboard, as well as a seasonally less rich mix in corrugated products compared to the third quarter.","In addition, we expect seasonally lower volumes and a less rich mix in white papers. With colder weather, wood and fuel costs are also expected to be seasonally higher.","Finally, as previously reported, maintenance outage costs are expected to be $0.10 per share higher in the fourth quarter due to the planned 24-day outage at our Jackson, Alabama mill for a major rebuild of the recovery boiler which will reduce production and increase costs. Considering these items, we expect fourth quarter earnings of $1.03 per share.","Now, before I move on to the Q&A portion of the call, I want to announce that effective October 31, Judy Lassa will retire. On behalf of all of us, I want to both congratulate and thank her for the 33 years of outstanding service and dedication. She has agreed to continue to be available to us over the next 12 months on an as-needed basis under a consultation agreement. Paul LeBlanc, who currently reports to Judy as Vice President of Sales has been named Vice President of Boise Papers reporting directly to me.","With that, we'd happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constitute forward-looking statements. These statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company, and involve inherent risks and uncertainties including the direction of the economy, and those identified as risk factors on our Annual Report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.","With that, operator, I'd like to open the call for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub of Buckingham Research Group.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you. I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the bridge from third quarter to fourth quarter, if possible. I know that you had called out the Jackson rebuilds on your prior conference call, and that was $0.10. I guess historically, I thought that seasonal factors typically were in the $0.07 to $0.08 range.","And then maybe, mistakenly, I had thought that DeRidder might make a bit more money in the fourth quarter than the third quarter, but I recognize maybe seasonal factors might have affected that. But I didn't hear anything else that was really going on, and I wasn't quite sure if I'm missing something or \u2013 because the magnitude of the decline from 3Q to 4Q is a bit bigger than what I had anticipated using those inputs. Can you help me out there?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Mark. You're correct when you said that, historically if you went back over the years, the 3Q to 4Q impact was in that $0.08 range, going from three to four. However, with Boise, if you think about it, we're a 50% bigger company. So on a proportionate basis, if you go through the various elements, we're more in the line, probably $0.12 a share of seasonal Q3 to 4Q.","And the elements you're looking at would be box volume and mix going from third quarter to fourth quarter, mill volume going from third quarter to fourth quarter. You've got white papers volume and mix in the fourth quarter, and then wood and energy costs, typical increase.","So you got those four items that now would be more likely in the range of that $0.12 area. So if you combine the $0.10 outage impact along with the $0.12, and then $0.01 of other, you get from the $1.26 to $1.03.","And we did have \u2013 again, last year, we had about the same amount of seasonal costs in last year's fourth quarter, but it was partially offset by containerboard volume from the pre-build of inventory that we called out in order to support the 2015 beginning of the year heavy maintenance schedule on our containerboard business. That was about 45,000 tons of pre-build. And so we don't expect to see that type of pre-build this year. We now have the capacity with our D3 machine at DeRidder to support our Q1 maintenance downtime without that type of heavy pre-build.","So in essence, this pushes some of the earnings out of the fourth quarter into the first quarter of 2016.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Oh, okay. That's...","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Tom, you want to elaborate on that a little bit?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President-Corrugated Products","No, I think you summed it well. I think just overall, I think what people should realize, we've undergone a big transition. We were a company out of capacity buying a couple hundred thousand of tons on the outside to support our demand. But with D3 and other productivities (16:18) we got through synergy, we can now fulfill all of our internal demand with the additional capacity, and we still have room for growth over the next several years.","And so there's no need to pre-build inventory, because we can make it as fast as we can sell it in the first quarter. That wasn't the case when we were short of capacity. So I just kind of looked at that another way if that helps.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Got it. And that's real helpful. One quick follow-on if I could, just on the Jackson project. I think last quarter, actually pretty sure last quarter, you had called that out as being an unusual project and that next year your maintenance and outage expenses probably would be lower than this year. I think you'd said $0.05 or $0.06. I just wanted to verify that, that's accurate? And also, can you fill us in on what the capital costs on the Jackson project are?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. The Jackson outage this year involves \u2013 the big project is the rebuild of the recovery boiler. That was a 1973 vintage recovery boiler. And we're basically replacing the entire bottom of the boiler, putting a new steam generating section, and doing other various maintenance work on the project.","It's a $10 million capital spend, and again, this boiler will be good, it's lasted since 1973. We expect to get another 40-plus years out of the boiler. So \u2013 and this was a minimum effect of capital spend. We did study some various options looking at basically new boilers and complete rebuilds. And so, compared to a $75 million CapEx spend, we've avoided that, and we're at $10 million level, that gets us very, very good, efficient operation for many years to come.","Regarding your comment about where we were with next year, we did call out that this year, being $0.60 amortization for the outages, next year would probably be $0.55. Where we are now looking the fact that we got the capability at DeRidder; 2014 was $0.48 of amortized shutdown expense. We told you the $0.55, there's going to be something in between that $0.55 and $0.48 that gets us into a more normalized range.","And so, we'll give you details in the January call when we give you specifics about our plans for next year.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks so much.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Next caller, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon of Vertical Research Partners.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes, and good morning. First of all, yeah, I just want to make sure it's clear, we did see that would call out that $0.10, and we had thought maybe the outage impact would've been an increment, but thanks for clarifying that the outage at Jackson is part of the $0.10.","The question I had is \u2013 and I think you answered it, but I just want to clarify, is you look back at 2014, you called out a $0.07 higher maintenance in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, and the earnings dropped $0.10. So, that would suggest that the other impact was $0.03. So maybe the way to think about that $0.03 is that, you still incur the $0.12 of seasonality, but that pre-build you mentioned might have offset $0.09 of that; is that in the ballpark?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Correct. The pre-build had big impact of offsetting that. You're exactly right. And Chip, the other thing, last year was an unusually large pre-build because of the huge DeRidder outage, and the pre-build this year, because we don't have all that work to do at DeRidder, is less, and we'll give details in the January call. But you're exactly right.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. That makes that clear. And then looking at the \u2013 that maintenance, so I understand that, $0.48 in 2014, around $0.60 in 2015, I think you said $0.55 in 2016, and then in 2017, the more normal flow will be between $0.48 and $0.55. Is that right or did you suggest that maybe next year could be between $0.48 and $0.55?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","What I'm suggesting is that, I think 2016 is going to be even lower than the $0.55 as we look at things and as we're concluding this year. When we gave you that $0.55, I believe that was on the July call and again, with what we know now. So, I believe the number will be somewhere between that $0.55 and $0.48. And so, that's why we're saying it's going to be heading to a lower normalized number that we can provide more clarity on in the January call.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Got you. And you mentioned \u2013 last question that you're now in a position to better supply your need. Obviously, D3 helps there. But of course you all have shifted the output of that machine more towards virgin, and I guess two questions.","One is, how has that dryer project gone and sort of what kind of incremental benefits do you expect? And secondly, would that mean that you might on the margin be buying a little bit more medium on the open market as we go forward and which would seem to be a good thing, given that market seems to be a lot looser or at least there's more availability than certainly you would see on the linerboard side?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Regarding the first part of your question on the project, we took the machine down for its intended work in September. We accomplished all of the dryer work and fine-tuned up some of the wet end and again started the machine up. The outage instead of 13 days, was just approximately 10 day outage, but executed very well. Machines started up flawlessly, quality is great.","And again with the work that's been done in the back-end of the mill to support the virgin kraft fiber production, we truly have the capability to meet that 1,000 ton a day of productivity off the machine as a virgin quality linerboard. And so, we can supply whether it's a medium mix, linerboard mix, that the machine has tremendous capability.","And so, going forward, for the foreseeable future, we have the ability in our legacy system and DeRidder to supply our needs. As Tom grows the box plant business, and takes that cut up into the system, we will reach a point where we are out of capacity. Right now, the DeRidder facility is at its design, and we're very pleased; but regarding the outside purchase of medium; that'd be a high-class problem to have in the future years.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And I guess, the last question is, are we sort of at the end of the Boise synergies? Or as we look at 2016, do you see them helping to offset some of the cost change \u2013 well, assuming there are cost changes on the upside, although I would imagine chemicals and energy are helping you. But could you sort of update us on those synergies, if you could? Thank you.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","We've said on the July call, we're not going to give you specifics right now. We'll give you a summary on the January call. We told you in July that we were on target for the year, heading towards the $200 million run rate, and we called out a few items, one of which has been the I Falls turbine generator project, that's an example.","Your comments about the efficiencies, as we said, we were able to overcome the year-over-year price decline impact on the white papers side with improvements in that business, and that was an example, again that we've said we'd be continuing to make improvements in operational efficiencies. And that's a great example. And that would be a direct synergy.","So those are the type of things that we're looking at, and we're very pleased with how that's all rolled in. But again, and we've mentioned this in July, we're one company now, and we're not going to be getting into the specific synergy items. But we will give you a summary in January of where we are.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President-Corrugated Products","Yeah, Chip, I'd add. Again, it gets harder, we're going to make the $200 million by the end of what we've predicted that we were $175 million, and we'd get to the $200 million over the next year, which would be in the next year. But it starts to get muddied after a while, after you get the standalone-type projects of what is really just normal efficiency improvement or what is synergy related. In other words, comes from putting two companies together.","And we don't want to spend a lot of time trying to do nothing, but accounting. We'd rather spend our time on nothing, but improving the operations. And so that's why we'll give a summary at the end of the year, but it's \u2013 and we're going to make our numbers, and there's more operational improvements that will happen in 2016. We're just calling them normal operational improvements. We're not calling them synergies anymore.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Understood. Thank you very much.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Next caller, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Philip Ng of Jefferies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Is it mostly...","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Yeah. Is it mostly due to comps or have you lost any market share? I don't think that's the case. But just seems like volumes for corrugated was a little weaker during the quarter. I mean, you guys have historically outpaced the broader market, and guidance for 4Q seems pretty soft growth as well. I just want get some color on what you're seeing on corrugated volumes?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Phil, when we look at the third quarter, and we built our guidance of $1.28, we had estimated obviously a little bit higher volume. We did come in at the 1.3% year-over-year. So we are off about 1.2%. Tom, do you want to add little color to what you saw?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President-Corrugated Products","Yeah, Phil. Keep in mind, the economy is certainly not performing as we would hope it would. And I think it weakened a little bit in the quarter. But still, we beat the industry by almost 50%. And that's against, of course, record comps from the previous quarter \u2013 previous year's quarter. But we \u2013 also in the past, if you recall, when we had higher growth rates, it was a mix of both organic growth and acquisition growth. And we haven't made an acquisition now for about 18 months. So you're now talking about fewer organic growth here.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Got you. I mean, and that's a great segue. And my next question was going to be, are you seeing a little more competition on box assets in the M&A side, and could you look to grow more organically from just building some new box plants? How are you going to tackle that, I guess ultimately?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President-Corrugated Products","Well, I think that \u2013 sure, it's a little more competitive. There's no question about it. You see the amount of activity that's going on, and also, those multiples have gone up dramatically. So we're very delighted with the fact that we were at the leading edge of this in terms of the acquisitions. But \u2013 and there's a lot fewer available. If you look just what's happened in the last quarter, I mean there's been some pretty significant acquisitions both in box plants and the mills; independent mills got acquired.","So there continues to be quite a bit of activity there. That said, we're still looking at opportunities, and we will continue to do so. I feel good about a couple of them. So, we'll see where things go, but also, we'll continue with our strategic capital investments as we have in the past to find opportunities where they're best suited.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And just to be clear, we outgrew the industry in the third quarter, and when you outgrow the industry, you increase your market share. So your earlier comment about losing market share, it's the opposite. We outgrew the industry, and by definition, we've increased our market share. And then as Tom pointed out, it's not as much as this previous quarters, but we still outperformed the industry.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And I guess just one last one from me. A major competitor of yours is idling significant capacity for containerboard. Just curious to get your view on supply\/demand over the next year or so in light of some of the new capacities that's coming on. Thanks.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. You know, for anti-trust reasons, I don't want to comment on that. For PCA, we run to demand, and that's how I'd answer that.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks. Good luck in the quarter.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari of Citi.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. Tom, just a follow-up on Phil's question. You said that you were interested in opportunities and actively looking at opportunities. Is that on the box plant side or the mill side or both?","And then just following up on that, I mean, one of your large competitors made a large acquisition of recycled mills. Would you be interested in recycled mills, given you've been more levered to virgin historically, but OCC has been lower for longer than many of us expected?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President-Corrugated Products","We're primarily looking at box plant acquisitions. We would like to add to that side of the business. As far as recycled mill capacity, we're not actively looking at that. And quite frankly, I think, as Mark made very clear, our projects that we've just completed at DeRidder position us very well to accommodate the growth going forward for quite some time. So I think our mill system is in excellent shape.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. And then just switching to white paper, I was wondering if it's possible to parse how much of the $0.13 hit in the quarter was from price versus mix. And then just following up on that, post the boiler rebuild in Jackson, is there any incremental volume that you'll be adding in Jackson, or is there any impact to the mix at Jackson?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Are you referring to \u2013 again, year-over-year there's a $0.13 paper price mix going from third quarter 2014 to third quarter 2015. And then \u2013 so again, for the fourth quarter, you're probably in that $0.11; but \u2013 in terms of the year-to-year impact, but not quarter-to-quarter.","Judith M. Lassa - Senior Vice President-Paper","Yeah. And then I'll just \u2013 I like to put \u2013 the only comment I'd like to make on that are; the index is down $35 a ton quarter-over-quarter from last year. There is a lot of mix impact and it really is in all of our segments.","We have more commodity in our office segment, less recycle in premium. We have a more offset and less envelope in the mix center are creating, converting. We're still experiencing price erosion on the pressure sensitive, which adds to that as well. And then pulp has been down quite a bit, (32:02) down $70 per U.S. shipment, and about $80 to $100 on shipments to China. So all those components add to that mix.","And the question on Jackson, I mean, the Jackson piece doesn't impact \u2013 I mean, it's the overall business mix for Q4. We built inventory for the Jackson outage. So just some more commodity in office in Q4, and some more offset versus envelope in premium (32:26).","Robert P. Mundy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","But the recovery boiler outage does not affect the paper machine. You won't get any more tons off of paper machine by the rebuild on a recovery boiler. Hopefully, we'll get a little more with the burning capacity, which means that we can buy \u2013 less purchase pulp down there, and that helps the cost side of the equation.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Staphos of Bank of America.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Hi, guys. Thanks for all the details. I just wanted to piggyback on the maintenance question, and then the sequentials, really into first quarter. So would it be fair, piggybacking on Chip's question then, that we should be expecting a more favorable seasonal pickup 1Q versus 4Q, to the tune of $0.09, you get all that in 1Q or would that be somehow spread over the other quarters?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Again, we only give guidance one quarter at a time, George. And so...","George L. Staphos - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Understood.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Again, and I did say this. We looked at this year's maintenance amortization of $0.60. We did call out $0.55, but we know now looking at where we are. We do believe that the maintenance amortization for the year will be lower than the $0.55. How much?","We'll qualify and quantify that in January, but I can tell you, just inherently looking at the shutdown activity next year, the bulk of the heavy lifting done, we did all the big major work at DeRidder. The white paper mills have two years of time to fix a lot of opportunity. And so we're going to be truly into a more normalized annual shutdown activity in 2016, but I can't give you the detail right now. And we'll clarify that on the call in January.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay. Understand. Figured I would give it a shot. Now, I think you had mentioned, third quarter was maybe off a little bit from your expectations on volume. Fourth quarter, I thinking you're guiding for a slightly higher corrugated shipments, if I heard you correctly. Tom, could you talk at all to bookings and orders early in the quarter, relative to what's in your guidance?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President-Corrugated Products","Yeah, George. I've got 10 days of data, and after 10 days of data, our bookings and billings are running about 1% over previous. And keep in mind that those were record quarters and record comps. So, it's a \u2013 we've got some tough comps, but we're still running slightly ahead.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay. My last two ones, I'll ask them in sequence, and turn it over just for time sake. This question, I think has come up in the past. If you could remind us, what's your view on the uncoated free sheet capacity you have, and its suitability over time if you need more containerboard capacity for conversion? Obviously, they wouldn't necessarily be well situated given the fiber mix, but I want to see what your view on the optionality of that would be or whether you think a further expansion at DeRidder would be more likely if you could talk to that?","And then, the other question I had with demand, this is certainly not your fault, but demand being a little bit softer than perhaps we would have seen earlier in the year. With the mills now running more normally, does it suggest that you'll need or you'll have the ability to run with less inventory in 2016 than you were running in 2015? Thanks and good luck in the quarter.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","George, regarding the first part of your question, we are not contemplating any conversions currently. I'll finish that comment up with comments we've made for many years now. Anything can be converted at a certain capital investment, providing you have the fiber availability and the market demand.","Regarding the last part of your question, inventory, with where we are, we do have the capability to supply. But we have a lot less pressure. I'm not going to quantify what we intend on doing next year. Our current inventory is up a couple of thousand tons over the beginning of the year. We're comfortable at that range.","But yeah, we've got a lot more flexibility now. That's why we don't have to do the bigger pre-build. And so \u2013 so we now have built in some capability to overcome some of the transportation challenges. But again, we don't expect those challenges to ease off. We expect them to become more of a challenge in the upcoming years, but we have a lot of flexibility for those.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Thank you.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Wilde of Bank of Montreal.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Mark.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Question first for Judy. Judy, I just wondered if you could talk about any impacts you're seeing so far from the anti-dumping duties in the white paper business?","Judith M. Lassa - Senior Vice President-Paper","Certainly. So, the July market stats with the preliminary CBB (37:57) in place at the end of June, and the ADD (38:00) announced for the end of August really started to show some signs of movement on imports being done by 36,000 tons and like a real reduction in China and Indonesia. But customer inventories are still high with some of the pre-buying that took place. And we think the impacts could begin to show up maybe mid to quarter end.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then I just \u2013 looking at the trade data the other day, it seems like you can see this drop in cut size imports, but it looks like kind of converting grades might be going up. Can you speak to that?","Judith M. Lassa - Senior Vice President-Paper","I can only speak to what we're seeing in the stats, because like I said, we don't participate there.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, all right. The other two questions, I had were on the containerboard side. One, I wondered, one of the indexes moved down in the trade papers this last weekend, and if you could just comment on whether that is \u2013 there's any impact from that in your fourth quarter numbers.","And the other thing I wondered, Tom Hassfurther, are you seeing any impact in your specialty business from all of these evols that have gone in? Because, when people first started putting in evols, they talked about how quick they were to change from product-to-product, and that they could go after more of that specialty business, and I wonder if that's really happening in reality?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President-Corrugated Products","Okay. Mark, let me answer the first one regarding the index change. I see that will have very little impact for us. The changes that have taken place, if you really read the detail, they're basically related to 100% recycled media. There's a whole variety of quality levels, of course, with 100% recycled medium and the core quality, obviously, and I was trying to find a home.","So it's an area we don't really participate in. It does sometimes get reflected in grades that we do, we are in. But I think most of our customers understand that it's really about the quality of semi-chem and their need for semi-chem. So, we're not \u2013 I don't think we'll see much impact at all regarding that.","The specialty business and evols. You asked what evols do. It's pretty hard for me to tell exactly what our competitors are doing with evols, but I think if I was to generalize, I would say that not much has changed in terms of how people are using evols, more output purposes.","And if you really see what's going on when people install evols, many of them take out two or three flexors to put in one evol. So, if you're going to do that, it's going to be pretty hard to run a lot of graphics on it given the output that you have in two flexors and going to one evol.","So, I don't think that's going to have some \u2013 having a dramatic impact either.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. All right. Sounds good. Good luck in the fourth quarter.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President-Corrugated Products","Thank you.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Manuel of Wells Fargo Securities.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, gentlemen. Two questions for you. First, cash usage here, it looks like you had stepped up repurchase a little bit in the quarter. It's been kind of level almost what you've done all year-to-date. Can you comment a little bit on uses of cash going forward? Do you anticipate picking up repurchase a little bit? Are there \u2013 is that reasonable or unreasonable?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Again, where we're looking at right now as we build cash, we're going to remain opportunistic in our stock buyback. As we summarized, we bought back $55 million worth of stock in the quarter. We've paid down some debt and continue to pay the dividend, and build cash. So got a lot of firepower here, and we'll continue to do \u2013 take advantage of that. But again, we don't have any stock buyback targets. And again, it all ties into where you're looking at capital for the year. So, we've got a lot of opportunity as we wrap up the year and go into the new year with our use of the cash.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Second question I had was, now that you've got the DeRidder machine fully running or fully capable, I think your integration level has kind of moved to the 83%, 84% range. So a) if you could kind of verify that, and then b) appreciating that you run the demand, so you'll fill all your needs internally for box \u2013 box plants first, that remaining, I don't know, 16%, 17% that you have, how would you characterize the export market today for price demand?","Are you having any difficulty finding a home? Are you seeing any further price reversion beyond just currency? Or how would you have us think about that, and your ability to continue to run kind of flat out in export or would you think about bowing that back a bit?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'll handle the export pricing first, and then talk about what's going on. Right now, the pricing in export is \u2013 pricing has gone down. It's primarily driven by currency, which is the largest factor. Trade flows is another one and economic conditions around the world. So the massive slowdown that you saw that's taken place in China as an example obviously has some impact. And of course, the currency situation around the world is the primary impact.","Export demand remains pretty stable, quite frankly. It's not \u2013 there's a bit of a global slowdown, but the export demand is still pretty good. We're just going to have to deal with some of our pricing issues going forward as a result of those items I just mentioned. And regarding integration level, we're currently at 85% level.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you, guys.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly of CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you. Just two simple questions on the cost side. You've highlighted some meaningful cost pressures this quarter, and you did last quarter, too. So I'm wondering as you think about the boiler and other productivity projects whether you think you have enough to offset that over the next year if these current kinds of cost trends stay in place?","And second, you obviously had some fiber issues last summer that were weather-related. Do you expect weather aside to be in much better shape this year?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Regarding the first part of your question on costs, historically, we're always working every day addressing cost efficiencies and opportunities within the mills, and box plants and that will continue. And that's not changing.","So on the second part of your question regarding fiber, we did see a better summer weather wise. And so, harvesting conditions and wood availability improved significantly compared to the fall and winter months, and early spring. The Tomahawk commentary regarding wood prices was primarily related to the fact that it was a catch-up issue that so many mills and paper mills and saw mills run their inventory so low during the winter. The pricing pressure remained even though harvesting conditions improved. But all-in-all, the wood harvest and wood volume has improved considerably year-over-year.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","So, you won't carry more wood going in this winter?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Well, we'll carry the normal amount of winter wood build. We do that every year. The industry \u2013 as an example, the Gulf Coastal region, the Mid-South region, you always end up traditionally with the winter rain periods. And so, it's a typical winter wood build. But again, what we're seeing to date; we haven't seen the fall or rains that we saw last year in some of these areas. So, it's a much more normal season right now.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Very helpful. Thank you.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey of Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.","The negative mix impact on corrugated in the fourth quarter, so is that all seasonal or is there anything else happening? I know you talked about the economy being slower than where we were earlier in the year. Is that having any impact on the mix or is that all just a seasonal impact?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","That's all seasonal impact, Alex.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Very good. And then on the cost side, so certainly, the seasonal uptick makes a lot of sense, and then we see every year. But what about the decline in oil prices that we saw in the middle of the year? And I think diesel will probably be about $0.50 a gallon lower in the fourth quarter, chemicals are continuing to come in. Is that going to have much impact on the business?","Robert P. Mundy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Oil price has been down for a year. Natural gas prices have been down. And so, we haven't seen any relief in terms of transportation costs. Rail and trucking have continued to raise rates regarding overall costs, regardless of what the \u2013 what their diesel fuel was. So, in terms of fuel, that hasn't changed basically year-over-year.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","And we don't burn any oil in our boilers.","Robert P. Mundy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And natural gas has been pretty stable.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. Okay. And just last one, intra-quarter it was reported that Turkey put in some tariffs on kraft linerboard from the U.S., I know you're not a big exporter, but you do put in some product into Europe. But were you putting any products into Turkey, and what sort of \u2013 if you were, what sort of the plan for that product?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President-Corrugated Products","Alex, I really can't talk about what markets we ship into, and stuff, so we'll just leave it at that. Obviously, we're small in the export market to begin with.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Okay. I'll turn it over. Thank you, guys.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Gaffner of Barclays.","Scott Louis Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Louis Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So, if I look at 3Q, it sounds to me, after we've gone through everything, that really the only item that came in below expectations was the corrugated product shipments, or was there anything else that came in below your expectations heading into the quarter?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. You got it right. I mean, it was a great quarter, except we're just a little bit lighter on volume compared to our original forecasting model that we had built our guidance on for $1.28. So the $0.02 miss was directly related to that little lighter volume.","Robert P. Mundy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And to put that into perspective, the first half of the year, we were up 2.5%. We had forecasted about 2.5% for the third quarter, and we came in at about 1.3%. So when you adjust that for yield, that basically \u2013 had we made that 2.5%, would have been right on our number.","Scott Louis Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And so as we look at the fourth quarter guide, I hear a lot of seasonality, a lot of \u2013 around demand and input costs, and again maybe the only thing that's changed in your mind is corrugated product shipments, I just \u2013 and it sounds like we may be misestimated a lot of the seasonality here. Is there anything other than corrugated product shipments as we go into 4Q that is below where you would've expected it to be, maybe midway through the year?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","No. As far as where we would've expected, just the box volume is softer, but then again, it's \u2013 it all is related to the normal seasonal softness, and it's spelled out in the earnings.","Robert P. Mundy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And our box volumes forecast is predicated on what we see today. If the economy starts to pick up, that's going to be a positive. If the economy slows down more, that will be a negative. And so there's uncertainty about this number, but as Tom mentioned, we expect our volume 4Q-over-4Q to be up in corrugated. So when you say soft, we'll still be up. We may not be up as much as we had hoped, and if the economy picks up a little bit, that'll obviously help us.","Scott Louis Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Sure. And just last question on the guidance. I realized historically you've only given one quarter forward on the guide. But it sounds to me as if the fourth quarter guidance really isn't that far off from what you expected before. It's more \u2013 our models had differing seasonality, and they are maybe based on history versus where the company is today. Any thoughts around possibly giving further out guidance so that you don't have this volatility in the stock on a day like today?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","No. We're comfortable with giving guidance one quarter at a time, and we'll leave it at that. Yeah. I think we're the only company in the industry that even gives you a firm number one quarter at a time. So, we don't give you full-year guidance, but I don't know of anybody else that publishes one quarter in advance. So, we think we're ahead of everybody in that regard, and we're not going any further ahead.","Scott Louis Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Fair enough. Thank you.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from George Staphos of Bank of America.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Hi, guys. Quick one. Just on capital allocation, maybe for Tom and Bob, if we are to understand that multiples for corrugated assets have maybe trended higher over time, and certainly you were ahead of the curve a few years ago with what you were doing, you're still going to need if you continue at your historical trend, more converting capacity at some point.","Have the returns gotten such where it makes more sense to do greenfield, or basically what I'm asking, are box plant greenfield investments at this juncture higher returning from what you can see relative to the suite of acquisition opportunities you've got out there right now in box plant? Thanks guys, and good luck in the quarter.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Let me start with that again. Looking at the opportunities that have been presented in the last year or so, obviously, we've been looking at them. As Tom mentioned, there was some rich prices. We had capacity within our own system to continue growing the volumes. And so, we've been pretty judicious about how we look at the assets, and the inherent value, and it's all related to the book of business.","And so, going forward, if you were to look at capital allocation into the box plant side of the business as opposed to building a greenfield box plant, theoretically you're always better to go buy an existing book of business than an existing plant. And so with that Tom, you want to add any color there?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President-Corrugated Products","I would just say, George, that our strategy is not going to change. I mean, if we find an acquisition that meets our financial objectives, but primarily meets a great customer base, great management team, and obviously accretive to earnings and it makes sense for us to do a buy under those circumstances, I mean we'll do that. In addition, we'll continue to look at strategic capital investment where that makes sense, and \u2013 which we've done in the past.","So if we're in markets where we're out of capacity in terms of converting capacity, and we've got customer base who desire to do significantly more business with us or they're expanding or whatever the case might be, I mean, in those particular cases we'll certainly invest in the strategic capital.","So I think our \u2013 just because we haven't made an acquisition in the last 18 months doesn't mean we're changing our strategy by any means. That said also, keep in mind that, what is able to be acquired out there is getting less and less every day, because of the activity that's going on. So, those \u2013 that capital may flow into other buckets. But we'll see what comes up as the future goes.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","That's all fair. Thanks for the time, guys. Again, good luck in the quarter.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Thanks. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from Mark Wilde of Bank of Montreal.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah, just on the \u2013 going back to the box business, Tom Hassfurther, I just wondered, we've seen these ISM numbers slipping over the past few months. And historically, they've correlated pretty well with the box business. Can you tell me based on what we've seen in the ISM, do you actually expect box volumes to soften further over the next couple of months?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Executive Vice President-Corrugated Products","Mark, I really can't predict what the future is going to hold. All I can tell you is that, as I indicated that the numbers didn't set what we had hoped they would be. So we didn't have a lot of tailwind, quite frankly, from the economy in the third quarter. But I can't predict at all what's going to happen in the fourth quarter.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then, one other question I had is just going back to this integration level. You've always operated since you became public in a pretty tight band on integration. I'm curious, if you saw a good mill asset come up over the next year or two, would you actually be willing to take that integration level down further for a good mill asset?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","I don't want to speculate on that, because that's absolutely purely speculative. And I just don't want to get into that. And Mark, that's a question it's so open-ended. If somebody wanted to give a mill away for next to nothing, that was good asset, we're really interested in things that are almost free. But to pay the normal price, no.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. I don't see any giveaways right now.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Me neither.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. All right. Thanks.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive Officer","Thanks. Next question, please?","Operator","Mr. Kowlzan, I see that there are no more questions. Do you have any closing comments?","Mark W.

Upon conclusion of his narrative, there will be a Q&A session.","I will now turn the conference call over to Mr. Kowlzan, and please proceed when you are ready.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning and thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's second quarter 2018 earnings release conference call. I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA. And with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs our Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer.","I'll begin the call with an overview of our second quarter results and then turn the call over to Tom and Bob, who will provide more details. I'll then wrap things up and then we'll be glad to take questions.","Yesterday, we reported second quarter net income of $187 million or $1.97 per share. Second quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.11 per share primarily for certain costs related to discontinuing paper operations associated with previously announced conversion of the No. 3 machine at the Wallula, Washington mill over to linerboard. Excluding these special items, second quarter 2018 net income was $197 million or $2.08 per share compared to the second quarter 2017 net income of $144 million or $1.52 per share.","Second quarter net sales were $1.8 billion in 2018 and $1.6 billion in 2017. Total company EBITDA for the second quarter excluding special items was $382 million in 2018 and $328 million in 2017. Excluding the special items, second quarter 2018 earnings per share of $2.08 was $0.56 per share above the second quarter 2017, driven primarily by higher prices and mix of $0.47 and volumes $0.26 in our Packaging segment, higher prices and mix in our Paper segment of $0.05, lower fiber costs $0.07, which was a combination of improved fiber usage and lower OCC prices, and a favorable tax rate of $0.16, primarily resulting from Tax Reform changes.","These items were partially offset by higher operating costs totaling $0.24 per share and converting costs $0.02, primarily due to the inflation-related increases with labor and benefits costs, repair and material costs, environmental and other professional services, equipment and building rental costs, et cetera, as well as the addition of converting costs related to our Sacramento Container acquisition. We also had higher freight expense of $0.09, costs related to the Wallula No. 3 machine, conversion of $0.04, higher annual outage expenses of $0.01, as well as higher depreciation $0.02, and other costs $0.03.","Our results were $0.12 per share above the second quarter guidance primarily due to higher prices and mix and higher volumes in our Packaging and Paper segments, and lower mill operating costs.","Looking at the Packaging business, EBITDA excluding special items in the second quarter 2018 of $363 million with sales of $1.5 billion resulted in a margin of 24.2% versus last year's EBITDA of $305 million and sales of $1.3 billion or a 23.3% margin. We continued to run our containerboard mills all out in order to keep up with the demand and they performed extremely well during the quarter. We successfully executed scheduled maintenance outages at two of our mills, and the first phase of conversion work on the No. 3 machine at the Wallula mill to a high-performance 100% virgin kraft linerboard machine was executed extremely well both from a ramp-up curve perspective, as well as operating costs perspective.","These outstanding efforts allowed us to achieve all-time record containerboard shipments and supply all-time record box shipments. We ended the quarter with containerboard inventories about 8,000 tons above the first quarter 2018 levels and almost 54,000 tons above the second quarter of 2017, primarily due to the addition of inventory needs of the Sacramento Container acquisition and the need to build inventory in certain regions of the country in order to help mitigate the higher freight and logistics issues that we continue to face.","And now, I'm going to turn it over to Tom, who will provide more details on containerboard sales and corrugating business.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Thanks, Mark.","Overall, corrugated products and containerboard demand remained very strong during the quarter. As Mark indicated, in corrugated products, we achieved all-time record for quarterly box shipments which were higher in total by 8.3%, with one additional workday or 6.6% per workday compared to the second quarter of 2017. Continued strong demand in both our domestic and export markets improved our outside sales volume of containerboard by over 21,000 tons versus last year's second quarter. Outside volume was over 11,000 tons below the first quarter of 2018 in order to help supply record shipments from our internal plants.","Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.38 per share above the second quarter of 2017 and up $0.19 per share compared to the first quarter of 2018. The realization from our announced price increases was greater in this year's second quarter compared to last year, as the key containerboard price index, which many contractors tie to, occurred one month earlier than last year and our implementation was executed faster than last year as well. Export containerboard prices were up $0.09 per share compared to the second quarter of 2017 and up $0.02 per share compared to the first quarter of 2018.","I'll now turn it back to Mark.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Thanks, Tom.","Looking at the Paper segment, EBITDA excluding special items in the second quarter was $38 million, with sales of $251 million or 15% margin, compared to the second quarter 2017 EBITDA of $41 million and sales of $254 million or 16% margin. Our announced price increases were realized quicker than anticipated during the quarter and volume for our cut-size and printing and converting products remained strong. The decline in EBITDA and margin versus last year was due to the low results in our pressure sensitive business at the Wallula mill. Additionally, inflation on input costs and operating costs as well as higher freight and logistics expenses negatively impacted EBITDA during the quarter. Excluding the results of Wallula's pressure sensitive business that we're phasing out of, our ongoing Paper business EBITDA margin was 17% for the quarter.","I'm now going to turn it over to Bob.","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","Thanks, Mark.","The primary uses of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $166 million, common stock dividends totaling $59 million, interest payments of $39 million, and $12 million for state income tax payments. We ended the quarter with $200 million of cash on hand.","There are no changes to our 2018 estimate range for our combined federal and state cash tax rate of 15% to 16% and our book effective tax rate of 24% to 26%. However, versus the guidance we provided back in January, our planned annual maintenance outage costs will be higher by $0.02 per share in the third quarter and lower by $0.01 per share in the fourth quarter. The full year total will now be $0.01 higher, totaling $0.61 per share for 2018.","In addition, we have updated our full year 2018 estimate for capital spending to a range between $530 million to $550 million compared to the $440 million to $460 million we provided you earlier this year. The increase is attributable to addressing profitable growth and mix enhancement opportunities at several of our box plants, the large plant expansions going on in the Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Virginia regions that we've mentioned previously, as well as a few high return, quick payback projects in a couple of our containerboard mills related to fiber and energy.","These projects along with our recent 25% dividend increase fit in very well with our expected cash flow and our balanced approach towards cash allocation in order to profitably grow our company, maximize returns to our shareholders, while still maintaining the financial flexibility to act upon accretive M&A opportunities and adhere to our conservative balance sheet approach as we have in the past.","I'll now turn it back to Mark.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Thank you, Bob.","Looking ahead as we move from the second into the third quarter, we anticipate continued strong demand in our Packaging segment. However, corrugated product shipments will have one less shipping day during this quarter. As Tom mentioned, although the majority of our previously announced price increases were recognized in the second quarter, we expect to implement most of the remaining portion during this third quarter.","In the Paper segment, we expect to complete the implementation of our previously announced paper price increase. However, volumes which are currently on allocation should be lower than normal during the seasonally stronger period as we manage our already tight inventory levels around the scheduled outage at our Jackson mill.","Finally, we should have improved operating costs related to the No. 3 machine at our Wallula mill, as the ramp-up curve from the first phase of the conversion is now behind us. We expect continued inflation in most of our operating costs including slightly higher recycled fiber prices and incremental wage pressure with a tighter labor market. As Bob mentioned, our scheduled maintenance outage costs will be $0.02 per share higher than the original third quarter guidance. And we anticipate freight and logistics expenses, as well as slightly higher tax rates. Considering these items, we expect a third quarter earnings of $2.14 per share.","With that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors on our Annual Report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.","With that, Heidi, could you open up the call for questions, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. And your first question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes, hi. Good morning, Mark, Bob and Tom. First question has to do with, you mentioned some very strong \u2013 relative to what \u2013 I think you sell pricing benefits in the export markets and if you could give us an idea of how many tons you generally sell there, and do you think some of the issues in China with their shortage of OCC, shortage of board is putting out a very strong bid for export prices for pretty much anything that can be sold?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. Tom, why don't you go ahead and talk about that one?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Chip, we don't go into great detail about what our exact sales are on the export market. But I will say that the market has remained strong as you can see indicated by our sales. The pricing has still remained very solid, and I see that continuing.","Relative to China, I mean, you get back to the same thing. They've got to get fiber into their market. We've got the whole OCC thing that's going on and nobody can predict really what the future holds other than we know one thing, they're going to have to have fiber. So, that's probably going to pool from different areas and different regions of the world. And so, I think that the global market still should remain very good.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. Chip, just keep in mind, over the years, the amount of tons we've moved offshore probably been in the range of 8% to 10% of our total production year-to-year, and that hasn't changed that dramatically. We continue to take advantage of the legacy customer relationships we've got around the globe, we probably sell them to about 36 countries still throughout the world. So, that's pretty consistent.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Got it. That's very helpful. And looking at your current footprint and I know things can change, you mentioned the almost $100 million increase in CapEx, is any of that maybe timing-wise attributable to the tax incentives we have where, I guess, you get the full write-off? And maybe directionally, getting back to the first part of the question, when you look at your current footprint, do you think directionally we would see the numbers stay in the same area? In other words, are there opportunities like these to the same magnitude next year or do you think it might back off a little bit, again, assuming no major change in your footprint?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","So, first part of the question, the fact that taxes are lower certainly helps us. But the bigger factor is that we've got tremendous opportunity especially on the converting side of the business and that we're aggressively going after on the corrugated side. We've recognized these opportunities, we've got the demand, and so we're taking advantage of that demand and opportunity and the improved tax position.","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","Next year.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","And then, so for next year, if you think about a lot of the capital this year went into DeRidder activity and Wallula mill activity. Theoretically, we don't have as much \u2013 because it's a conversion cost, those are big one-offs. So, those shouldn't be there unless obviously something came along in the future. But the spending level will remain higher on the corrugated product side to take advantage of the demand. We should see the mill side coming down accordingly because of the big projects won this year.","Tom, do you want to add to that?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. I would just add that one thing hasn't changed at all in the way we do business and that is we don't just invest the capital in the hopes to get the business, we do it based on what our customers tell us and what the demands they have and what our opportunities are that are already in place. So, this isn't a build it and they will come.","So, I think when you look at the future, Chip, you say what kind of opportunities do we have in the future, I would expect we'll continue to have these kind of opportunities because they are customer growth.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Understood. Thank you.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Next question please.","Operator","Yes. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning, Mark.","Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.","Thank you. I'm hoping you could give us a little more insight into the Wallula ramp versus your expectations, what still to come and what happens before the engineers turn onto the next thing. And you've said that that tonnage already has a home. As that adjustment takes place from purchased tons to internal ton, are we going to be able to see that, or is that going to get caught up in this cost inflation?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","The first part, talking about the ramp-up, we are extremely pleased with our machine started up. We are essentially a few days ahead of schedule. Machine was selling very good quality product within a few hours of startup. The performance of the machine, if you think about the terms that I talk about quite frequently, and that's about time and efficiency on a paper machine, the Wallula No. 3 machine quickly became the \u2013 I believe it was the second best running machine in the company in the month of June with extremely high efficiency performance. Quality has been great, but again we are limited in productivity because we don't have the new press section and headbox. And so, we'll wait for that in October, we're running \u2013 on a daily run rate basis, we're running about where we expected to on tons. We don't disclose that. But we're probably somewhere around 60% of the total estimated machine design.","But the great thing is we took all of the learnings from DeRidder and I mentioned this on a lot of the prior calls. We took three-and-a-half years' worth of learnings at DeRidder and compressed that into this outage this past May and went ahead with everything all at one time essentially and we'll finish that in October. So, so far, we're extremely pleased.","And then to the other part of your question, for the first half of the year, we purchased outside tons, about 192,000 tons, 195,000 tons, somewhere in that area give or take a few thousand tons. Those tons for the remaining portion of the year \u2013 we will bring the purchased tonnage rate down. We're taking advantage of the productivity out of Wallula. And as we said, we have a home for those tons. Those tons will take the place of some of the purchased tons. And so, we'll definitely take advantage of the Wallula production.","Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.","Just one last question. Once Wallula is fully up and running, what do you think your overall net short position in the company is going to be?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","We're going to probably stay in this range of 200,000 tons of outside purchases right now and that depend \u2013 I mean, if you assume that demand remains strong and trending in what we've seen, it is in our best interest to continue buying some of these outside tons because of the transportation benefits we see from the regions we buy within.","Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.","Makes sense. Thank you, Mark.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","All right. Next call.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, Mark. Good morning, Tom.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Hey, Mark.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Mark, if we just take a step further back on this China issue, do you have any thoughts on the prospective changes in the way China sources fiber for paperboard packaging and what the implications may be for the North American industry and for PCA over the next 5 or 10 years?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. Mark, everything is so dynamic in that regard. The news we see every week, I think, is quite interesting coming out of China. We could think about it in the last 20, 25 years on containerboards trying to build about 50 million ton system, what that says is they have to get fiber from somewhere, what that fiber source is, if they're going to run that system. So, I really don't have a good answer. It's pure speculation on my part and I'd rather not get into a speculative discussion with you. But to your point, they have to get fiber, if they are going to run their containerboard system or buy linerboard from essentially the U.S. market to ship linerboard to supply their box needs.","Tom, do you want to add to that at all?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Mark, I mean, it just depends on what you read and what you hear from other \u2013 what I'd say knowledgeable people. But, it looks like they may be trying to create more of a closed loop system like Europe has down the road where they're collecting their own recycled fiber that feeds back into the mills. But, of course, as we all know, you got to have virgin to be able to have that system, which I think it would indicate that they're either going to \u2013 they got to get their virgin fiber somewhere and then it's primarily probably going to come from the U.S., and that may be reflective of some of the investments that some of the Chinese firms are making in the United States as well. I think they're probably looking at the potential of exporting containerboard or pulp or whatever the case might be back into China. That also could revolve around tariff issues as well. Who knows? But that's the way we see it right now.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. Okay. The other question I had is just you've seen, Tom, to be growing the box business more rapidly than I can recall in the 20 or so years you've been a public company. Can you give us some sense of where you think you're going to be at in terms of integration level by the end of 2019 with this incremental investment you're making in the box business and the high growth rates you've had?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Well, let me answer it this way. I don't know what Tom comment. We continue to run \u2013 and we just define it as it's fully integrated. We're moving some containerboard tons outside domestic and export. We're buying some of those tons and net that out. But when you call 95% integrated or 99% or 100% or 102%, we're running fully integrated. And I would expect that as time goes on, especially with the Wallula tons coming up by the end of the year, next year, we'll continue to be in that position, fully integrated. And that's a place we feel really comfortable. It's a good place for us to be. It gives us the ability to source our containerboard in ways that we find advantageous to us. Especially within our own containerboard system, we're able to run it full health and take advantage of our own efficiencies. And so, I would expect that next year, we'll be talking along the same lines.","Tom, do you want to...","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. I'd just say, Mark, I mean, if you think about the prior comments that we've made around the fact that we don't add capacity just for the sake of adding capacity. I mean, we know we have the demand for that. And we said that prior to the Wallula project, we said we were at 95% plus integration and that's exactly where we'll be when Wallula is fully ramped up.","And I'd just add that one of the reasons we do the outside purchase is we don't make all the grades. And so, it's more advantageous for us in some cases to buy those grades on the outside as opposed to try to make those grades internally.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. Okay. The one other thing, just related to these conversions, your cost per unit on the conversions seems to be quite a bit lower than some of the other projects we see out there. Mark, do you have just sort of a couple of general thoughts on that?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Well, every mill is unique, every mill has certain design characteristics, and I've said this for a number of years now. Any mill can be converted to make virtually any kind of paper product or board product. It's how much you're willing to pay. And obviously, people are willing to pay more and less in some cases. We have to be very good at understanding how to apply minimum effective capital and get the most return for that dollar.","A part of what we do and we've done this for decades is a somewhat of a phased approach. So, we go in with one or two phases at a minimum and make sure we don't overspend. And then, when the first phase is done, it's easier to look at what opportunities did you leave on the table, and that's part of our engineering excellence and operating prowess. So, again, I think but it goes back to, every mill is unique and every mill has its strengths and weaknesses. So, that's pretty much it.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","That's helpful. I'll turn it over. Thank you.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Next question, please.","Operator","Yes. The next question is from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details. I wanted to start on the investments that you're making in converting, Tom and Mark, and recognizing you're not going to get into much detail on a live mic presentation, can you give us a little bit more detail in terms of what changes you see in end markets, how they're evolving over time, whether it's more growth in one versus another or changes within one, say like e-commerce, that may be framing the investments that you're making in Wisconsin or Pennsylvania? And any other color around those areas, that would be helpful to start.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","George, this is Tom. I'll just give you a kind of a general answer to this. And then, if you really want to get into more specifics, I mean, you can follow up. But our investments in the converting area are around a couple of things. One is, I told you, it's based primarily on customer demand and what a customer wants. But also, when we're making these investments, obviously, we're looking at the cost side of the equation as well. We're looking at better efficiencies. We're looking at lowering our labor costs, as an example, and more automation, those sorts of things. Those are really the primary drivers that we're looking at in terms of these investments.","The end markets that are evolving, I mean, I think what you're seeing right now is and we'll see the GDP number tomorrow, I believe, for the past quarter that it's projected to be up around 4%. And in order to get those kind of GDP numbers, obviously, we've had \u2013 a lot of sectors have to be growing and a lot of things have to be happening in those sectors. I think we're fortunate because we're aligned with so many thousands of customers and so many different businesses that we're already entrenched there and we're able to react quickly to whatever those changes are and what those demands are that are driven in those particular markets. And then subsequently, we're making those capital investments around those particular needs that our customers have.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks for the thoughts on that, Tom. And then, going from bigger picture maybe to some more nut-and-bolt types of questions, and I'll turn it over, in terms of the variance and the change in EBITDA in Packaging, when I look at second quarter 2018 versus 2017 and looking at the year-on-year that occurred and the improvement in performance there, it works out to roughly about $58 a ton in the second quarter of this year versus $39 a ton in the second quarter of 2017. And both of these quarters obviously had a price increase at the beginning of the quarter. Is all of that change and improvement explained by the timing difference in pricing or were there other factors at work? That's question number one.","The other question, when we think about third quarter of 2018 versus third quarter of 2017 and the sequential trends that you were seeing in inflation, overall, are you seeing more inflationary pick-ups this year versus last year? And if you could put some numbers or some source on that, that would be great. Thank you, guys. I'll turn it over.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. Let me start out with this and then Bob can add to this or Tom can add. So, to your first question, it's primarily timing. And then the second question, we called out in January and reminded everyone in April that factors such as energy, chemicals and freight were significant this year, and that's what we've seen. And so, the logistics issues, not just the cost of rail or cost of truck, but again, just the availability and what that does to certain lanes and certain regions.","But, Bob or Tom, do you want to add supporting details?","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. I was going to say, yeah, freight, George, is one of the larger ones that Mark mentioned, in addition to some of the chemicals and whatnot. But labor infringes (31:02) due to the tight labor markets, that's a big change compared to the same period last year, as well as just inflation on all those things that don't get talked about a lot like repairs and materials and supplies and all these outside services and contractors, people who are service providers to your company, they're having to pay more and they're charging you more. So, all that is more than we've seen in prior periods, for sure.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much. Good luck in the quarter, guys.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of (31:43) with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Unknown Speaker","Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. The first one centers around the Wallula conversion and sort of looking at the task ahead of you in October. Can you highlight for us maybe some of the key risks that you see with putting in the headbox and the press section? Is it more risky, less risky than what you've already done either operationally or from the cost side?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. The risks are the same. It comes down to two factors: that the vendor that has supplied you with this equipment has done a proper job in building this equipment to proper specifications, and then it comes down to us installing this in a precision manner and yet we've proven we're very good at that. So, I am saying that the risks are no different than what we've done over the years. We just have to execute well and do it very efficiently. So, quite frankly, the work we just completed this spring was more complex and more demanding than what we have coming up in October. In October, we have discrete work going on. It's a headbox change-out. It's press section component change-out. So, it's more concentrated with a smaller region compared to what we've just gone through this spring. So, again, I'm not worried about the risks.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Thank you. And then, Tom, you normally try to give us a sense for how things are trending in the corrugated business thus far in the third quarter, could you do that for us?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. Through 14 days of July, we're up 5.5%. July is an unusual month usually every year because it tends to be just a little bit slower. So, it's trending that way. It'll continue to ramp up through the month. So, we see demand still very strong. And we had a little unusual Fourth of July in the middle of a week which really caused some changes with some of our customers, but again, that's why it'll continue to ramp up through the month. So, all in all, it's still very strong.","Unknown Speaker","Thank you.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Next question, please.","Operator","From the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to ask about the commentary you had around inventory management related to your Jackson mill. Is that a thing just related to the project there in the quarter or should we expect anything to move through into Q4? And could you just give us a sense of how material it is in the quarter for guidance?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Let me answer the first part of that. Obviously, we've been running under an allocated mode in the Paper business. So, with the fact that you have a shutdown, we only have two mills in the Paper business. So, you're taking half of your Paper business down for its annual shutdown. And so, where we are in allocations to many of our customers, we've already depleted inventories down to certain levels that we have just managed.","And so, it's just a case of some \u2013 the business is strong. We have the scheduled outage and we will get through that. And so, fourth quarter, both mills will run. If demand continues to run in the range it's been, you'll continue to be running in an allocated mode. And so, it's just \u2013 we'll update you in October where we are with inventories. But, certainly, the outage does change some of the metrics on what you're able to do or not do in terms of supporting customers. So, we plan that for the year and that's how it works out.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And my second question, thank you for the disclosure around the updated capital allocation or CapEx specifically. I'm just curious if we should read into this at all that the attractiveness, acquiring bolt-on acquisitions, specifically converting assets is something that's less desirable for you at this point. Really, just looking at kind of multiples for converting assets currently or is there something else that we should read through from this?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","No, not at all, Debbie. If the opportunities come along and present themselves in terms of acquisition opportunities, we will fully take advantage of that. In the meantime, as Tom mentioned, we're fully taking advantage of growth with customer demand and taking advantage of that within the regions, or within certain plants. And so, we're going to take advantage of both sides of that equation.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. I'll turn it over.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you. First, just on the corrugated pricing side, you had mentioned that it was better than normal, I believe, in terms of the way the increase is being put through. Was that just an observation on the pace of which the price increase is being put through or does that also characterize the degree of pass-through you feel you're going to be able to get, and if there's any color you can provide as to whether or not you might get more than full forward pass-through into boxes at this juncture?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. Mark, what you have to understand, demand has been obviously very strong. And the first part of your question was truly is a timing related factor that the index picked up with pricing, we're able to execute on that, and Tom's group did a great job executing on that.","Tom, do you want to add a little more to that?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. I think, probably one of the best examples would be this in regards to timing. So, if you have contracts that go up on a quarterly basis and you have a price increase as we did this year in March, announced in March, you can capture that in the second quarter. Last year, price increase was represented in RISI in April. Therefore, that catch-up wasn't until the third quarter. So, that's probably the best example \u2013 as an example of timing that you have, Mark. And relative to the rest of the price increase, we'll have to just talk about that at a future date, you'll see that in our earnings.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. But, when you had mentioned that the majority was recognized in the quarter, I assume that's a reference to by quarter end as opposed to the average price during the quarter, is that fair?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","That's fair.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","And then, lastly, I guess, I'm just trying to understand the industry data, the last 12 months, and not your \u2013 your performance, I'd just say, very strong in the volume side, but the industry data has been a little bit softer the last couple of months even while \u2013 as you referenced GDP is very \u2013 is likely going to be coming in very strong. Any thoughts as to what might be happening?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","It just depends on where you are and depends on the business. We see a lot of strength in some areas and we see a little more softness in other areas. We talk to a lot of our customers and talk about reducing inventories and doing other things like that, that can create some swings over a 30 or 60-day period. If I look across there, almost 20,000 customers, I mean, I can tell you that for the most part, they're reporting strong demand. And you'll see some seasonal swings in terms of agriculture, some other things. I mean, the graphics business is seasonal. So, if you just look in the last few months, I mean, they sometimes tend to be the softer months anyway in any given year.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","All right. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Mark and Bob, good morning.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning, Adam.","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Just two questions, one back to the CapEx issue for one second. Sorry to harp on this, but it sounds like your CapEx will be up about $200 million 2018 versus 2017, obviously, some of that's the Wallula conversion, and I think someone asked you this earlier, but could you give us some sense as to what you think a normalized number is or a maintenance number is such that we have some idea of the degree to which CapEx is likely to drop off in 2019 versus 2018?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Well, again, talking about the discrete opportunities, if you think about the big buckets of capital, you had the DeRidder spend, you had the Wallula project spend, and then, you had some of the converting side, big projects, the new plant we're building up in Wisconsin, and then some of the big regional reconfiguration projects that are very discrete one-off type opportunities. And then, as we go forward, you will normalize in terms of ratios of maintenance to profit enhancing capital opportunities. And so, over the long term, the ratio of maintenance CapEx to profit improvement should remain somewhere in the normal range at the same store. But for the time being, while we got the demand, this will allow us to take advantage of this growth opportunity, we will apply capital and continue to do that.","Bob, do you want to add to that?","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. I'll say, Adam, the delta you mentioned between 2017 and 2018 and your question around 2019, I'd say, because of the investments on the box plant side of the business with the mill side coming down from the DeRidder and Wallula spending this year, I'd say, the delta for 2018\/2019 will be about half of what you saw for 2017 to 2018 right now would be a good ballpark.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Perfect. Thank you for that. And then, just a housekeeping, just how much of the box and white paper price increases did you realize in Q2 and how much do you have remaining in 3Q or second half?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","We're not going to get into the specific on that. We've got obviously some contractual type activities and some of that kicked in on July 1. We'll have a little of that that kicks in later in the quarter. And then, the lion's share of it is in the quarter and just wrapping up a few odds and ends in terms of customers.","And on the Paper, the same thing. We've got the bulk of that was picked up in the second quarter. We got some contractual that kicked in as of July 1, and then we got a few others rolling in as we speak, so. But I'm not going to get into the details on that.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks, Mark.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","All right. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning, Scott.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, Mark. Just couple of quick questions on input costs. I mean, you mentioned higher recycled fiber going into 3Q versus 2Q. Can you talk a little bit more detailed about that? And then also, what are you seeing around virgin fiber? Are you seeing increased inflationary rates on virgin fiber, or is it still sort of couple of percent a year inflationary pressure on virgin fiber?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. Regarding recycled fiber, two components of that. If you think about OCC that we use in containerboard side and then some of the sorted office waste \u2013 sorted office paper, sorted white ledger type product that we use in the paper mill side of the business, we have seen within regions, OCC has moved up, DLK and LCC (44:40) moved up in a few of the regions where there's very strong demand, sorted white ledger, and some of the recycled white grades have stayed up and moved up, so that continues to be on the high side.","Bob?","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. I would say, Scott, just relative to Wallula and then as we bring more of that capacity on and as we'd talk about when we announced that project, fiber in that part of the country is higher than it is for the company on average. So, as that becomes more \u2013 we purchase more of that to supply Wallula, that would move up the average on the virgin fiber side of things relative to what you've seen in the past.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Within the legacy side of the business, we haven't seen much change. Again, it's typically weather-related phenomena within the regions and everything is pretty flat quarter-to-quarter, year-over-year right now.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And when you look at this CapEx that you're spending, obviously, recycled fiber input costs coming down in total even if they're going to go back up in the second half of the year some, are you looking at potentially investing in some of your mills to up the capacity or the ability to take on some of this recycled or mixed waste paper as part of your production process?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Not currently.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. One last one for me. Just around the increases in inventory, I mean, as you bring these new facilities up on line, like Wallula, is there some view to pulling inventories back down because you'll be in a better situation from a location perspective around freight cost?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Well, theoretically, that's what you'd want to do and so we will continue to monitor the logistics, freight issues on a daily, weekly, monthly basis and see what we're capable of doing as Wallula comes on to full capability at the end of the year. But, theoretically, that's where we want to be.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","I'd just say one other thing, Scott, to your question about our mills and using recycled \u2013 it's about who we sell our products to, and all fibers are not equal. That's why when you look at the capacity coming on, if it's recycled capacity versus virgin, it's a big difference because it serves different customers and we and the products that we sell are primarily virgin-based and that's a big difference because all fiber is not the same. You can't just start running it through your mill system because the price is lower. You don't end up where you want to be from servicing the customers.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Understood. Thanks, Bob. Thanks, Mark.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Good morning, everyone.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","I kind of want to take the opposite tack of that thing on the inventory levels. If freight is increasingly expensive and perhaps a bottleneck, does it make sense to hold more inventory at some of your box plants simply to reduce that cost?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Well, again, from a real-time point of view, we will do whatever makes sense whether it's on a weekly, or monthly, or quarterly basis to understand how do we take advantage of the mill production capability and the box plant needs. And so, the fact that we have Wallula coming on now really helps us fill out our U.S. regional requirements on how we have to supply these box plants. But it's something that you are monitoring, again, daily, weekly, monthly and we'll have a much better capability on how that works out. But, again, a lot of work. Everything depends on transportation availability and transportation cost.","(48:42)","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","I just wanted to ask on the Paper side of the business. It seems a little bit stronger than we were expecting in the quarter. You mentioned kind of being on allocation. I just wanted a few thoughts on pull forward and volumes ahead of some of the announced price increases. And hoping you could also just comment on the \u2013 where those price increases stand at the moment, if you got any of it in the quarter or kind of how much you expect to get in 3Q.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Just on the first part of your question, we didn't see any pull forward. It's just that all year it's been a very robust, tight market for cut-size and converting grades, offset printing and the envelop-type grades. So, we're living through a very robust market. We're running full out. And so, it's that simple.","And regarding pricing, we're not going to comment on the pricing anymore than we already have in terms of what we captured in the second quarter and then a few remaining contractual obligations that are rolling to the third quarter.","Bob, do you want to add anything?","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","No. I think that covers it.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And I just want to follow up on \u2013 just back to the $100 million of incremental CapEx, would it be reasonable to assume something around a 20% return that you'd be targeting on that investment and in what year or what kind of cadences realizing that should we expect?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Well, again, we generally are more ambitious than 20%, and so I'm not going to qualify that except to say that the projects that we've identified are right in line with our historical return expectations. And so, we'll answer it that way.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","All right.

Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Well, publications have called out that there's some incremental tonnage coming in for long shorts (51:55), nothing significant, but you would expect some of that. But, again, in total, the imports are a small percentage of the total demand in the United State, so.","Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC","All right. If I could just sneak in one last one, trade publications have talked about Chinese producers looking to process waste paper outside of China and then import it to China. I'm just wondering if you have any perspective on whether that makes any sense cost-wise, like, whether there's \u2013 this is an area that you can see that would make sense to create recycled pulp sheets in Southeast Asia and then ship it to China.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. You got to talk to them. I mean, I'll be just offering speculation. I mean, they are the ones who are running their own models and trying to understand how they satisfy their own needs.","Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","All right. Next question, please.","Operator","And we have a follow-up from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my follow-up. Mark, this morning, we saw \u2013 Cascades has indicated they're going to convert a mill in Virginia. At least, from what I've heard folks like you and others in the industry say, it's simply that, if you can convert anything, you've said on the call, if you put the money into it. What I'm asking is, it seems like the only announcements we've seen and it seems like seven of the top eight have either said they're not doing something like WestRock or \u2013 where they've actually made announcements for the next four years. The only ones involving $100 million or more dollars, or real money, are the top eight integrated, or within that top eight integrated players.","And question is, does the level of vertical integration in the industry make it just unwise to do a project without having a box plant system, or said \u2013 to say differently, if you decided to enter the U.S. industry today, would you need to also build a whole network of box plants at least as you look at the economics?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","And again, looking at two parts of that question. Cascades is an integrated company. And so, they already have demand as you would expect an integrated company would have that that would seem to be the logic of why they would be looking at capacity. And so, it's not as just somebody just thinking about building a mini mill and then trying to understand how they go to market. In this case, they're an integrated North American participant and that has converting capacity and converting demands.","Tom, do you want to answer the other part of that?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. Chip, I would just say that my opinion is, is that you're absolutely correct when you say you have to have some sort of a level of vertical integration in order to take on a project like this. And of course, I mean, when you're talking about the level of integration in the total industry, it's incredibly high. And so, if we modeled a mill that we said we were going to do with no customers, it would appear that we would have to sell from coast to coast and we would have to get a significant market share just to be able to continue to operate that mill.","So, I think you're right on in terms of what people would have to do in order to really get these conversions in place. And, as Mark said to Scott, I mean, they can export back into Canada, they can do a whole lot of different things. But, again, that's \u2013 very few have been virgin and most all of these have been 100% recycled which, as Bob alluded to, again, that's \u2013 you narrow your market when you're producing just that grade.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Understood. Thank you.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning. Just following up on Scott's earlier question on CapEx. With the high-return projects on the mill side, is it accurate to say those are purely cost reduction projects and you're not debottlenecking any capacity either virgin or recycled? And does any of the work on the mill side carry through to, I mean, first half of 2019?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. There are two discrete projects that we move forward funding on. One is a high-return energy project and that's at the Filer City mill, and the other is a fiber-related project. It's a virgin wood chips-related capacity opportunity at the Counce mill. But it's a high-return investment at Counce for woodyard enhancement. Those are two good examples of high-return cost.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then, on the converting side, I mean, Tom, you reminded us you don't add capacity in anticipation of demand or waiting for demand to come. Is it fair to say that you're sold out or running on allocation maybe in some areas of your corrugated business?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Well, I never like to use the word sold out or anything like that because we do have other plants, they can pick up the slack and with literally just under 100 plants around the country, we work very hard to service our customers totally. But, yeah, you could say that in these particular cases, I mean, demand is outstripping our ability to supply some particular markets with our current customer base. So, therefore that's why we're doing the things that we're currently doing in the box plants.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Next question, please.","Operator","Mr. Kowlzan, there are no more questions. Do you have any closing remarks?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Yes, Heidi. Thanks a lot. Everybody, I appreciate you joining us on the call and look forward to having you join us on the third quarter call in October. Have a good day, everybody. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

Your host today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chief Executive Officer of PCA. Upon conclusion of his narrative, there will be a question and answer session.","I will now turn the conference call over to Mr. Kowlzan, and please proceed when you are ready.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning, and thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's first quarter 2017 earnings release conference call. I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA, and with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President who runs our Packaging business and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer.","I'll begin the call with an overview of our first quarter results and then I'll turn the call over to Tom and Bob, who will provide more details. I'll then wrap things up, and then we'd be glad to take any questions.","Yesterday we reported first quarter net income of $117 million or $1.24 per share. First quarter net income included net special items expense of $0.03 per share, primarily due to the insurance deductible related to the previously announced incident at the DeRidder Mill.","Our current estimate of the total property damage and business interruption losses associated with the DeRidder Mill incident is between $20 million and $25 million, including capital costs of approximately $4 million. The estimated impact to the first quarter earnings, excluding capital costs, is $15 million, of which $5 million, or $0.03 per share, is included in the special items expense for the first quarter, representing our property damage and business interruption deductible. The remaining loss of $10 million, or $0.07 per share, that impacted our first quarter results is expected to be resolved with our insurance carrier over the next several months and is not included as a special items expense.","Additionally, as part of managing the impact of the additional DeRidder downtime on our containerboard system, we moved a previously scheduled annual machine maintenance outage at our Counce Mill from the first quarter into the second quarter of 2017, which improved expected first quarter results by about $0.01 per share. Excluding the special items, first quarter 2017 net income was $120 million or $1.27 per share, compared to the first quarter 2016 net income of $106 million or $1.11 per share.","First quarter net sales were $1.5 billion in 2017 and $1.4 billion in 2016. Total company EBITDA for the first quarter, excluding special items, was $299 million in 2017 and $272 million in 2016. Excluding special items, first quarter 2017 earnings per share of $1.27 was $0.16 per share above the first quarter of 2016, driven primarily by higher containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix of $0.16; sales volume, $0.12, higher paper segment prices and mix, $0.04; higher containerboard production volume, $0.07; and lower wood costs, $0.05. These items were partially offset by lower Paper segment sales and production volume of $0.06; higher cost for recycled fiber, $0.07; energy costs, $0.06; and freight, $0.02; higher labor and fixed costs, $0.02; and higher expenses for depreciation, $0.03, and interest, $0.02.","If I were to exclude the negative $0.07 impact of the DeRidder incident from our earnings, our results were $0.08 per share better than our first quarter guidance. Higher sales prices and mix contributed $0.03 in our Packaging segment and $0.01 in our Paper segment. Higher Packaging segment volume added $0.01 per share, lower indirect and fixed operating costs contributed $0.03 per share, and freight costs were lower by $0.01 per share. As mentioned earlier, moving our scheduled outage at Counce from the first to the second quarter helped by $0.01 per share. These items more than offset recycled fiber costs being $0.02 per share higher than we expected.","Looking at our Packaging business for the first quarter of 2017, EBITDA, excluding special items of $272 million with sales of $1.3 billion, resulted in a margin of 21.7% versus last year's EBITDA of $237 million and sales of $1.1 billion, or a 21.6% margin. The containerboard mills produced a first quarter record 932,000 tons, driven by strong demand and the need to supply our growth in box shipments, as well as the rapid integration of our new corrugated plants from the TimBar and Columbus Packaging acquisitions.","We ended the quarter with containerboard inventories, including the inventory needs of our two acquisitions, 12,000 tons below last year's first quarter level and over 16,000 tons below the year-end 2016. Although recycled fiber prices negatively impacted us approximately $11 million and higher energy costs another $9 million compared to last year's first quarter, improved usage of chemicals and fuels helped mitigate some of the impact.","I'll now turn it over to Tom, who'll provide more details on the containerboard sales and the corrugated business.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Thanks, Mark. In Corrugated Products, shipments in total were up 10.7% or 8.9% per workday compared to last year's first quarter. Our outside sales volume of containerboard was up over 6,000 tons versus last year's first quarter and about 2,000 tons below the fourth quarter of 2016.","Overall, Packaging segment volumes contributed about $0.12 per share above last year's first quarter and a penny above the fourth quarter of 2016, with higher box volumes being offset somewhat by lower mill containerboard volumes.","Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.16 per share above the first quarter of 2016 and up $0.17 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 as we continued to implement our October 2016 announced price increases during the quarter and we began the implementation of our mid-March increases. Export containerboard prices were up slightly versus the first quarter of 2016 and up $0.02 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.","I'll now turn it back to Mark.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Thanks, Tom. Looking at our Paper segment, EBITDA excluding special items in the first quarter was $44 million, with sales of $259 million, or a 17% margin compared to the first quarter of 2016 EBITDA of $51 million and sales of $281 million or an 18% margin. The $7 million decline in EBITDA versus last year was primarily due to the scheduled maintenance outage at our Jackson, Alabama, mill in this year's first quarter with no outage in last year, as well as higher energy and freight costs.","Paper segment price index was higher compared to last year's first and fourth quarters of 2016 due to improved mix in our pressure-sensitive business, as well as from lower pulp volumes due to our previously announced shutdown of the pulp operations at our Wallula Mill. Both office paper and printing in converting paper volumes were slightly lower and pressure-sensitive volumes slightly higher than the first quarter of 2016, while all paper volumes were up compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The elimination of market pulp volume was the key driver of the decrease in segment sales for the quarter.","I'll now turn it over to Bob.","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","Thanks, Mark. Compared to last year's first quarter, depreciation and amortization expense was $0.03 per share higher and interest expense was $0.02 per share higher due to items related to the recent TimBar and Columbus acquisitions. Our first quarter 2017 effective tax rate of just under 35% was about the same as last year's first quarter, as well as the fourth quarter of 2016. Cash provided by operations during the quarter was $164 million. Uses of cash and for the capital expenditures up $58 million, common stock dividends totaling $59 million, and $32 million in term loan repayments. We ended the quarter with $254 million of cash on hand.","As Mark mentioned earlier, we adjusted our plant annual maintenance outages for 2017 to help mitigate the effect of the prolonged outage at DeRidder in the first quarter. The revised estimated earnings impact by quarter, including the loss production, direct costs and amortized repair costs, is now $0.07 per share in the first quarter, $0.10 in the second quarter, $0.11 in the third, and $0.23 per share in the fourth quarter. The total for the year of $0.51 per share is unchanged from our previous guidance.","I'll now turn it back over to Mark.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Thank you, Bob. At this point I'm still unable to provide additional details regarding the incident at our DeRidder Mill because of the ongoing investigation. I want to reaffirm that safety and the well-being of the people working at our facilities is of the highest of priorities at PCA. As we first indicated subsequent to the incident, the annual outage work at the mill was delayed by one week and the mill resumed full operation approximately three days after that.","Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect to continue implementing our previously announced Packaging segment price increases, and we expect higher corrugated product shipments resulting from strong demand in our two recent acquisitions. Mill maintenance outage costs will be higher as we have scheduled outages at our three largest containerboard mills this quarter. We expect flat paper volumes, although pricing mix should move lower.","We also anticipate continued price inflation in recycled fiber, certain chemicals and freight costs, but our energy costs should improve as we move into seasonally milder weather. Considering these items, we expect second quarter earnings of $1.45 per share. This does not include any of the potential additional costs or anticipated recoveries related to the DeRidder Mill insurance claim.","With that, we'll be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constitute forward-looking statements. The statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and do involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC. The actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.","With that, operator, I'd like to open the call to questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll pause for a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first quarter comes from the line of Chip Dillon from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes, and good morning. First question, obviously things are humming along quite nicely in the Packaging segment, but when I think about the Paper segment, are you all happy with your footprint size given some of the erosion we've seen in the volumes in the overall marketplace? Does your position \u2013 is it typical of what we're seeing overall? Or are you in a different situation?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Well, as we've said before, we have a good position in that through the years with our mill down in Jackson, Alabama, and our mill up in International Falls. We can support the southern tier customer base and the northern tier customer base along with a portion of the western region. But the logistics supply chain capabilities within the Boise paper segment is the key to that business. And so in that regard, it's a good size business for us. It's we're able to take care of the customer base that we've built. And it's, again, the logistics supply chain is the unique aspect of what makes that business work so well for us.","Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And then I had a second one, just to clarify. It looks to me that the DeRidder situation impacted you to the tune of $0.10 in the quarter and that, in other words, you would have made maybe $1.37. And is that, first of all, the right way to look at it? And as we look to the future guide of $1.45, I would imagine that some portion of that $0.07 deductible comes back that you're not including apparently. And if that's true, could you just clarify that and also let us know sort of over what period of quarters you think that $0.07 does come back to you?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Chip, you're $0.03 over on what you're counting and we'll let Bob walk you through how that incident was accounted for.","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah, Chip, you wouldn't get to $1.37 because that $1.27 that we said was our recurring number already had called out the $0.03 for the deductible. So it's really $0.07 on the $1.27 so you get to $1.34. But you consider the fact that we moved the Counce outage out of the first quarter, it'd be more like $1.33. And that $0.07 that is in our recurring earnings, yeah, we do expect, hope to have that resolve by the end of the second quarter is what we're shooting for.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","But it's not included in the $1.45 guidance.","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","Yes. That's correct.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","So that's not included.","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","That's correct.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Anything else?","Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Understood, thank you. No, I think that does it. Thank you.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you and congratulations on an excellent financial performance in the quarter. First, I just wanted to get a current read on how business is looking in containerboard, if you can give us a sense of what box shipments in April are shaping up to be?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Again, we've had a great start to the quarter. I'm going to let Tom give you the color on that.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah, Mark, through 14 days we're trending at approximately 11% over April of last year on a per day basis.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Great.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","So things are looking strong right now.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","And also I believe this time around you \u2013 many in the industry, and I believe you as well, announced box prices going up simultaneous with containerboard. Does that potentially change the cadence with which the containerboard price increase might flow through to boxes? Could we see it happen faster this time around, and would that be built into the guidance that you gave?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Again, Mark, I'm going to let Tom get into the color of that but, yeah, timing is important in how this rolls out earlier in the year. So Tom, why don't you walk him through that?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Mark, I don't know if you know the \u2013 as we mentioned in the script somewhat, we've already announced the increases in mid-March on containerboard and of course that just was reflected recently in the publication. So we'll now begin the rollout of the box price increase. And we don't publicly get into what is exactly happening in our box price increase other than I'll say that traditionally for us we would roll that out in a very disciplined manner. And we'll achieve the great majority of that box price increase over the next 90 days.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. So we should look at history as a guide for the likely cadence of this increase, would that be.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","I think that's fair.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Yes.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And then lastly, if I could, you had mentioned that in the quarter itself you had $0.03 of benefit from lower indirect costs and then also $0.03 better from price mix. Maybe if you could give me a little bit more color? What are the lower indirect costs? And then on the price mix was that, I don't know if you can share with us, is that mostly price or mix and were you able to get better than full pass-through on the board price increase?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Bob, why don't you walk him through that?","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","Yes, lower indirect costs, Mark, are things at the mills like in the repair materials, the size, a little bit labor, a little bit \u2013 things of that nature. So that's what that is about.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","And then on that $0.03 price in mix, that was primarily from the box side, corrugated products side, containerboard price increase pass-through on how we achieved that.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Morning, Debbie.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Congratulations on a great quarter. I'm going to ask this question even though we kind of beat you up on this issue in the last couple of years. But you mentioned that your inventories were down 16,000 tons. You're headed into a seasonally strong quarter, and then you also suggested that you need higher levels of inventory due to the acquisition. So I was wondering if you could just kind of parse that out for us, how you feel about your system heading being in Q2 here?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Well, again, as I said on the call, we had run levels down to a point we haven't been at for quite a few years, but we are getting basically in a range that we were comfortable with. And so the TimBar and Columbus acquisitions, as we anticipated, required us to supply that system. And so that inherently brings our total supply requirement to a point that we haven't seen. So in that regard we're at a low point. With DeRidder, and then shifting Counce, we actually ended up a little bit higher than we had planned on.","But nevertheless, we're tight and we need to continue to run very hard. And so that's the plan. We'll get through these shutdowns. And so we're wrapping up the last of our containerboard mill activity this week as we speak. So we get that mill up and running and then we just need to run hard again to take care of this because we are in a position with the inventory management at a place where \u2013 again, if you go back a few years ago, with transportation issues, weather-related issues, we found it was necessary to run the inventory up to the higher levels. Transportation is not the issue it had been. And so, with that being said, again, I'll wrap it up by saying we're tight and we need to run hard.","\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nWell, again, on the paper side of the business, as you would expect, 2Q is always at a point \u2013 third quarter is always the most robust quarter. So coming off the first quarter and second quarter, you're pretty typically flat 1Q to 2Q, and that's what we're seeing. Our orders are where we expect them to be. We're quite comfortable with where the order activity is.\nAnd regarding how we're running the mill system, which is primarily Jackson, Alabama, and International Falls, we're running basically to demand, which is pretty well full out for those mills. And so we're in pretty good position right now. Again, we've just gone through outages at Jackson, and so we've come through the winter months, but we're quite pleased where we are with the paper business.\nDebbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\nOkay, great. Thanks. I will turn it over.\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nNext question, please.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nChris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC\nGood morning, gentlemen.\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nGood morning, Chris.\nChris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC\nAnd congratulations on a good year thus far. I'm trying to get my arms around \u2013 and I know whenever you buy things you integrate them pretty quickly, but a sense of \u2013 you talked about volumes up the first quarter in the box business and shipments a little under 11%. You talked about thus far being up 11% through April. Could you give us a sense of sort of in structure versus acquired? I mean, my guess is that I think industry is up about 2% through the first quarter and you were up 11%. I mean, is that a reasonable proxy of acquisition added 8% to 9% and industry 2%? Or how would we think about that?\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nWe're not going to get into the details of what was the acquisition-related piece going forward. We called that out on the January call for the fourth quarter and for the full year last year. We've used the term before. We're one company now with these acquisitions, and so rather than trying to break that out \u2013 because quite frankly during the course of the fall and the early part of the winter months, we were able to move business, integrate business and take advantage of the geographic locations of the acquired plants. So it's not we were trying to break out and parse what's acquisition-related volume. So again, we're looking at the total system, and again, we're very pleased with where see the volume. And we see this occurring nationwide. Tom, do you want to add anything to this?\nThomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America\nI really don't have anything to add. I think the important thing is, and the reason, as Mark mentioned, that we're now going to just report one company is also because of this movement of business and taking advantage of all of the synergies that are offered to us as a result of these acquisitions and making sure we drive that to the bottom line as soon as possible. That's why we really can't at this point in time try to break out what \u2013 where we used to be and where we are today. And we're just going to report it at this point.\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nI think regarding asking us how we looked at it going forward, we're not going to comment about our forward expectations.\nChris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC\nWell, maybe \u2013 look, I appreciate this is difficult, but maybe if I ask the question just slightly different. Historically, you've grown in line or better than the market. Nothing's changed with how you're going to market or recent competitiveness in the marketplace such that you wouldn't at least be keeping pace with the market. Would that be \u2013 maybe give me a sense of that's nothing changed. You're not losing big chunks of business.\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nWell, again, I think if you looked at history, it's always our goal to outpace the industry. But, again, it's a quality book of business and the type of business we're going after, so, again, I'll answer that question in July.\nChris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC\nOkay. Thank you. Let me switch gears one second and ask about inflation in flat pulp prices and some other things. As you look across \u2013 I know you flagged OCT was an issue. I know that the majority of operations though are kraft or virgin-based. There are some \u2013 can you maybe talk about some of the other inflation that you're seeing in the marketplace today? Energy seemingly peeling back a little bit. We do see some pulp going up. Do you make any other pulp that you sell externally? I think you had an op that you closed up in the Pac-Northwest, but are there elements of inflation that you're seeing through the system today?\nThomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America\nYeah, Chris, you were breaking up a little bit, but I think you were talking about some of the inflationary items we're seeing and obviously with recycled fiber is the largest, although we are less impacted than anyone else in the industry because of our 20% or so use of recycled fiber. Yeah, energy prices, they certainly have been moving up. They've tailed off a little bit lately, but we still see those at a higher level than they have been, as well as chemical inflation on caustic soda and certain coatings and sodium chlorate and other things. Those prices have continued to increase. And freight, you know, freight was up this quarter, and we expect it to move up a little bit more as we move into the second quarter.\nChris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC\nOkay. Thank you, guys. Good luck.\nThomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America\nThanks.\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nThanks. Next question.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.\nGeorge Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nThanks, everyone. Good morning.\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nGood morning.\nGeorge Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nThanks for the details. How are you? Sorry, I joined the call a little bit late. I guess my first question, if you hadn't already answered it, can you talk about your level of integration currently and whether you're, at this juncture, beginning to encounter any supply chain issues with it being too high? Any thoughts around that would be helpful. And then \u2013 well, let me leave it there and then I had a couple follow-ons.\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nYeah. No. We're at currently 95% integration and planning for that as we wrapped up 2016 on how we were going to supply the system. We're comfortable with how we're supplying the system. Again, we had anticipated looking at what we were doing with our outside volumes, also looking at what we're doing with mills like DeRidder. We had announced previously that we're working on some opportunities in real time at DeRidder to continue producing additional funds there. We just completed the first phase of the opportunities on number one and number three machines.\nAnd so as we move forward into 2018 with work that we already planned and that we talked about, we would look at an additional incremental supply base coming out of DeRidder. But in that regard, again, I'll go back to use the word tight. We have to manage our business very carefully. And it's you use some of the terminology from 2012. We're kind back in that same place again looking at all options on how we're going to supply the system going forward, but we've got quite a few options right now.\nGeorge Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nOkay. Thanks for that, Mark. My second question, the performance, again, was certainly quite good versus your guidance, and congratulations to you and the team on that. If you take a step back and look at the performance in the quarter, and you certainly had your share of challenges in the quarter, you know, whether it be operationally for issues you talked about earlier or cost, what \u2013 was the performance as good as you expected or was it better? And if was better, where was the source of the positive variation? Was it on operating leverage at the mills? Was on the fiber flexibility you have in the system? I recognize it's all of the above, but if you could give us some color? If in fact performance was a bit better than you thought relative to the challenges you faced, what was the source of that?\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nWell, again, across the board the entire system delivered on the volume side, on the box side. The volume was strong across the board. Operationally plants and mills performed very well, very efficiently. The paper side of the business continues to perform exceptionally well, very efficient performance out of the white paper mills. And so, again, and you asked the question and I'll answer that. I'm never really pleased with our performance. I always expect more. But again, I'm satisfied with where we ended up.\nBob or Tom, you want to add to that?\nRobert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America\nYeah. No. I'm just saying there was no one other than with better execution, I think, on our packaging segment pricing. I think that was executed a little better there. Other than that it was just little $0.01 things here and there, which is good to see. It was sort of across the board, as Mark indicated.\nGeorge Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nOkay.\nThomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America\nI would also add real quick that the integration of our acquisitions was exceptionally good and we really worked very hard to make sure that we captured the opportunities that were there. And the team at the acquisition plants have just done a phenomenal job of adapting to the PCA system.\nGeorge Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nMy two last ones, and they're quick ones. On that one, Tom, recognizing you're not going to break it out for us, was the contribution progress, however you want to define it, on the acquisitions greater this quarter than it was in the fourth quarter? Logic would say perhaps, just because you now have more time with those assets to work with them. Question number one.\nAnd question number two, back on the price mix benefit, and I think Mark had asked on this, the $0.03, that was obviously related to the prior increase that you were referring to? Or was there something else that we had missed there? Thank you, and good luck in the quarter.\nThomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America\nOkay. George, yes I think the progress was better in the quarter than what we may have anticipated. I think that as I indicated, we realized benefits sooner than maybe we even anticipated with these recent acquisitions. And yes also to the $0.03 primarily related to the price increase.\nGeorge Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nOkay. Thank you so much.\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nGood deal. Next question, please.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citigroup. Your line is open.\nAnthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.\nHi. Good morning.\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nGood morning, Anthony.\nAnthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.\nIn your prepared remarks, you said you expect continued price inflation in OCC and I was wondering if you're referring to year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter inflation? Do you expect additional inflation relative to I guess the $150 a ton RISI published for April? Any kind of color you had there? And if there's anything specific to the OCC markets that you're buying in that maybe is different from what we might be seeing in the national averages?\nRobert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America\nYeah. I'll just say that we do see some slightly higher recycle on average second quarter, first quarter prices, so as we look first to second. And then, of course, versus last year's second quarter, you know, up substantially is what we're looking at as far as recycled fiber.\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nYeah, Anthony, again, supply is very tight even though the price has come down a little bit from its peak. People are replenishing inventory so we're into annual shutdown activity and so again, I know there's been a lot of tightness in the supply so just along with what Bob said on the average price.\nAnthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.\nGot it. Got it. And then just as TimBar and Columbus settle out, is it possible to quantify your integration rate in the quarter?\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nNo. Again, at a point in time we're 95%, but.\nAnthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.\nUnderstood. I'll turn it over.\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nOkay. Next question, please.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner from Barclays. Your line is open.\nScott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.\nThanks. Good morning, guys.\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nGood morning, Scott.\nScott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.\nMark, I think you said your outside sales were up 6,000 tons in the quarter, but as you get relatively tight in the system, I mean should we expect that to reverse and have you actually purchasing outside tons as we go forward through the year? Or how should we think about that?\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nWell, you know we always purchase some outside tons. We've historically purchased specialty grade, as an example, various white top SBS-type grades, some of the very unique base weights. We're anticipating where we'd be with our integration level. We've taken advantage for transportation reasons, some close-in purchases. So we've always purchased and we will continue to purchase opportunistically as we go forward through the year.\nTom, you want to add anything to that?\nThomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America\nI would just say, Scott, I think the important thing is is that we've always had our outside customers. They're long-term relationships. We'll continue to supply them both domestically and in those export markets. Those are \u2013 as we've said many times, I mean, we're really small in those markets anyway and those are long-term customers and long-term commitments that we've had, and we'll continue to supply those as well. But we like where we are.\nScott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.\nOkay. And just taking that another step further. If I look at the CapEx, I think the CapEx was $58 million in the first quarter, which would take you well below the full-year run rate you'd outlined on the fourth quarter call. Was some of that just the maintenance timing issues, or would any of those projects normally just take place in the middle of the year? How should we think about that?\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nYeah, I mean a lot of it was really involved in DeRidder and the work that had to be done in DeRidder to take care of the mill and get the mill back up and running, and then take advantage of some opportunities that we had seen as the annual shutdown activity was taking place.\nScott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.\nOkay. Last one for me on \u2013 you mentioned rail availability, or you didn't mention rail availability, but you mentioned freight not being an issue anymore. Is that a matter of rail availability, or is it more not having increased truck freight rates and last-minute needs in your system?\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nIt's both. If you look at rail and truck over the last few years, we've had an easing up in terms of issues around rail, on-time shipments and deliveries, and truck availability. So again, from an availability point of view, trucks and rail have improved significantly over the last year.\nScott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.\nOkay. Thank you.\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nNext question, please.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Philip Ng from Jefferies & Company. Your line is open.\nPhilip Ng - Jefferies LLC\nLower wood costs was a $0.05 tailwind, which was a little better than we expected. I'm just curious, how much of that was a function of just reducing the amount of fiber you use or just lower prices? And how do you think about that progressing the rest of the year?\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nIt was primarily in pricing. Obviously, we always continue to work on yield improvements within the mill process itself. But we've had a good harvest season. If you went back to last summer and looked at the weather patterns into the fall with the winter wood build, we were able to take advantage of a much better weather pattern throughout the entire system that we operate our mills. And as we've gone into the springtime period, again, so far, we've experienced, again, very complementary weather patterns that have allowed us to harvest at better than expected wood costs.\nRobert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America\nAnd I'd just add one other thing, Phil. From the pulp operation we had out at Wallula, one of the things we mentioned there was that it would help just from a chemical and a wood usage standpoint. I think we saw on the paper side, we certainly saw some good wood usage improvement in this quarter's results.\nPhilip Ng - Jefferies LLC\nThat's helpful color. And when did prices start falling? Was it the back half \u2013 of wood prices? Do you start lapping some of those benefits in the back half of this year? Or how does that play out throughout the year?\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nWell, again, we've already seen benefit. And so, again, I can't predict what the future's going to be as far as weather, but it's been a gradual \u2013 if you went back over the course of the last year and you looked at average wood costs, you would have seen a trailing off, a nice steady decline in delivered wood costs throughout the entire system.\nRobert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America\nYeah, but I would say we're probably getting close, to your point. Maybe a little bit more benefit, but I think you're right. It's getting about to that point.\nPhilip Ng - Jefferies LLC\nGot you. And then I guess shifting gears, you guys have obviously done a nice job with some of these recent tuck-in box acquisitions. Would you need to do more debottlenecking at your mills or pursue another mill acquisition before you kind of continue some of these tuck-in acquisitions, which you've done a nice job adding value? And at current multiples, just how do you assess the attractiveness of a greenfield mill versus M&A? Thanks for the color.\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nWe're not going to get into our strategy on how we're going to supply. We talked a little bit about some of the opportunities at a mill like a DeRidder that we'll take advantage of to bring on the necessary content that the corrugated side is going to require over the course of the future. Commenting on how we view an acquisition versus a greenfield mill, we've always believed and we think if you look at the financials around acquiring an existing asset versus building a new asset, especially with the capability that we bring to bear, it would be much better for us and in general for anybody to acquire an asset, especially an underperforming asset, and then go run it. And so that's how we look at asset acquisition versus greenfield. Anything else?\nPhilip Ng - Jefferies LLC\nNo, that's all. Thanks.\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nOkay. Next question, please.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nDerrick Laton - Goldman Sachs & Co.\nHey, good morning. It's Derrick Laton on for Brian. Thanks for taking my questions. Yeah, I just wanted to maybe go back to the last question there on the DeRidder potential bottleneck. Does any of that change now kind of given some of the movement going on in first quarter and then some of the outages in second quarter? Are you expecting that to get pushed out a bit? Or should we expect that to be pretty much as planned?\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nThe DeRidder incremental improvement that we've talked about publicly over the last few quarters is still on track, and we would expect the final piece of that to be showing up on next year's annual outage. Number three machine will go through its phase two portion of the work where we put in a new headbox and do some wet end work and a new shoe press to help with wet end pressing and drying and the overall productivity on the machine.\nDerrick Laton - Goldman Sachs & Co.\nGreat. That's helpful, thanks. And maybe just one more? You mentioned already in April pretty strong demand, and it looks like that's continuing from the last several months. In there anything in particular that's really standing out to you guys in terms of what's driving that demand? Maybe it's e-commerce or industrial production? Is there any one that really just stands out that's outperforming the rest?\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nAgain, we're very pleased across the board how the system demand looks. And we've looked also, and you've seen this in the news, West Coast agriculture appears to be stronger than it's been in quite a few years, and we expect a good, robust harvest season throughout the entire West Coast.\nTom, do you want to add some color to that?\nThomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America\nI just think if you look across our thousands and thousands of customers, I mean, we've got reasonably good demand across the entire base. So I think we feel good about that, and it's always more desirable to have solid demand across the base than in particular segments.\nDerrick Laton - Goldman Sachs & Co.\nGreat. I appreciate the color, guys. Thank you.\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nOkay. Next question please.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman from Roe Equity Research. Your line is open.\nGail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research\nHi. Good morning.\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nGood morning, Gail.\nGail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research\nYou touched on this a little bit, but can you take a step back on OCC and maybe just give your best take on what you think drove the spike and just how sustainable you think it might be, particularly compared to maybe the last spike we saw in 2011?\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nWell, again, China got into the buying pattern very significantly. And then again with demand, domestic demand being what it was, we saw the system get very tight. If you went back to 2010 we reached an inflection point on supply and demand in the U.S. system at that point and at that point we had actually had gone beyond the point. And so the rise in prices was due to the lower OCC generation. And then that was coupled with strong demand, as I said, from China, and again, very robust domestic mill demand.\nGail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research\nOkay. And switching gears, I know it's not a major market for you, but just what you're seeing in export markets right now?\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nTom?\nThomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America\nExport demand remains pretty good and prices are trending up. That's what we see in our export market.\nGail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research\nOkay. And this was touched on a few times as well, but just in terms of the purchase tonnage at TimBar and Columbus, have you integrated as much as you can at this point? Or is there still some opportunity to displace purchases there?\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nYeah, we've optimized the integration, as we had called out when we announced the acquisitions. We're very pleased on the tons that we moved through the system.\nGail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research\nOkay. Thank you.\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nOkay. Next question please.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Ketan Mamtora from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nMark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)\nHey. It's Mark Wilde. Good morning, Mark. Good morning, Bob and Tom.\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nGood morning.\nThomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America\nGood morning, Mark.\nMark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)\nI wondered just to start, I jumped on the call a little late here. Did you actually quantify, Mark, the amount of debottlenecking potential at DeRidder?\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nYeah. I mean, we've talked over the last few quarters at times, the number three machine, when we're done with it from where it was, we should see 100,000, 125,000 tons of improvement on that machine. But also on number one machine we've been doing various work, so between what we started earlier this year and then through next year we should be net gain of about 150,000 tons of incremental productivity out of the DeRidder system by mid-2018 coming out on the spring shutdowns.\nMark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)\nOkay. That's helpful. And then switching gears, I wonder, Tom Hassfurther, these box volumes that we've seen, really since about August of last year, have really been up pretty sharply, and that's after a lot of years where box volumes just didn't seem to move at all. What do you think has changed here? Because if you look at some of the other economic indicators and they really wouldn't tell you that we get this sharp of pick up?\nThomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America\nYeah. I think, Mark, I think there's a number of things that have changed, and obviously we've talked about e-commerce being a big plus. I think the ag business in the United States continues to grow. And I think, as Mark indicated earlier, we're seeing significantly greater outputs coming out of the West Coast now. So some of it is new growth areas and I think others is seeing a recovery from markets that have been down for a number of years. So, like, the West Coast ag as a result of the drive, again. So I think there's a number of moving parts here, and we're certainly pleased with the increase in demand.\nMark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)\nOkay. And last question I had. Mark, a lot of your peers seem to be focusing on things like, kind of, Latin America and other overseas markets. Is the focus for PCA going to stay really on the North American market?\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nExactly. This is our base of operation. This is where we plan on staying.\nMark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)\nAnd does that \u2013 would that include Mexico? Or you really want to stay in U.S. and maybe in Canada?\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nU.S.-based.\nMark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)\nOkay. All right. Sounds good. Good luck in the quarter.\nThomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America\nThank you.\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nThank you. Next question, please?\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of James Armstrong from Armstrong Investments. (48:01) Your line is open.\nUnknown Speaker\nGood morning, and thanks for taking my question.\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nMorning, James. (48:07)\nUnknown Speaker\nFirst one a follow up a little bit on the integration question. If the right opportunities presented themselves, would you be willing to be short liner board and medium for a certain period of time? In other words, would you be willing to go over that 100% integration level?\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nWell, it depends on the metrics on the financial analysis. If the deal was justifying returns and you were justifying based on having to go out and supply with outside content, then that's a pretty straightforward decision.\nUnknown Speaker\nOkay. Perfect. That makes sense. And then switching gears, what do you think your OCC versus virgin mix is now? I thought I heard you say a \u2013 give a 20% number. And with OCC prices high, do you have any ability to swing to even more virgin in your system?\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nWe're currently at that 20% OCC, 80% virgin kraft-type ratios. And we obviously took advantage of our flexibility in the mill system through the course of time now, so the fact is, though, with us having to run the mills full out, you really don't have the flexibility of reducing OCC if you choose to run the mills full. So again, we remain the lowest consumer of recycled fiber in the system as far as the industry in the United States at that 20% level.\nUnknown Speaker\nPerfect. That's all I had, and great job on the quarter.\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nThanks. Next question, please.\nOperator\nMr. Kowlzan, I see that there are no more questions. Do you have any closing comments?\nMark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America\nAgain, thank you, everybody, for joining us on the call. We look forward to talking with you in July. Take care.\nOperator\nThis concludes today's conference call.

Your host today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chief Executive Officer of PCA. Upon conclusion of his narrative, there will be a Q&A session. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Mark Kowlzan and please proceed when you are ready.","Mark Kowlzan","Good morning and thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's third quarter earnings release conference call. I am Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA. With me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs our Packaging Business and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer.","I will begin the call with an overview of our third quarter results and then turn the call over to Tom and Bob who will provide more details. I will then wrap things up and be glad to take any questions. Yesterday we reported third quarter net income of $119 million or $1.26 per share. Third quarter net income included special items of $3.3 million for acquisitions-related and facility closure costs. Excluding special items, third quarter 2016 net income was $123 million or $1.30 per share compared to third quarter 2015 net income of $123 million or $1.26 per share.","Third quarter net sales were $1.5 billion in 2016 and in 2015. Total Company EBITDA for the third quarter excluding special items was $299 million in both 2016 and 2015. Details of special items for the quarter were included in the schedule that accompanied our earnings press release.","Third quarter 2016 earnings per share excluding special items of $1.30 was equal to our guidance and was $0.04 per share above the third quarter of 2015 driven primarily by higher containerboard, corrugated products and white papers sales volumes of $0.04; higher white paper prices and mix $0.03; lower costs for energy $0.03; fiber $0.07; freight $0.03; lower annual outage costs $0.01; and the lower share count resulting from share repurchases for $0.04. These items were partially offset by lower domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix of $0.13; lower containerboard export prices $0.02; lower paper production volume $0.02; and higher costs for labor and fringes $0.04.","Looking at our Packaging business, EBITDA excluding special items in the third quarter 2016 of $256 million with sales of $1.17 billion resulted in margins of 22% versus last year's EBITDA of $268 million and sales of $1.14 billion or a 23% margin.","Operationally, the mills ran exceptionally well with production of 950,000 tons driven by the need to support record box shipments and a rapid integration of the new corrugated plants from the TimBar acquisition. We ended the quarter with containerboard inventories 16,000 tons below last year's third quarter and 11,000 tons below the end of the second quarter of 2016 as a result of the strong sales volume and the integration of containerboard related to TimBar.","I am now going to turn it over to Tom who will provide more detail on containerboard sales and our corrugated business.","Tom Hassfurther","Thank you, Mark. Corrugated product shipments excluding TimBar set all-time records for both total shipments as well as shipments per day with our shipments up 1.7% in total and per workday compared to the record third quarter of 2015. Including TimBar, shipments were up 4.9%. As a comparison, the industry was up 1.5% in total and per workday. Our outside sales of containerboard were about 15,000 tons above last year's third quarter and about 27,000 tons above the second quarter of this year. The higher volumes were driven by improved sales in both the domestic and export markets. Export containerboard prices were about 6% or $0.02 per share below third quarter 2015 levels and flat compared to the second quarter of this year.","Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.13 per share below the third quarter of 2015 and down $0.05 per share compared to the second quarter of 2016. In the fourth quarter, we expect outside sales of containerboard and corrugated products shipments to be lower compared to the third quarter with four less shipping days and some seasonal slowdown in demand that usually occurs during the Christmas holiday period. As we have indicated in previous third quarter earnings calls, our corrugated products mix will be seasonally less rich in the fourth quarter as the produce business in the Pacific Northwest as well as the display and high-end graphics business for the Christmas holiday period normally falls off during the quarter.","However, we do expect overall corrugated products volumes to be slightly higher than last year's record fourth quarter. Additionally, we notified our containerboard customers of a $50 per ton price increase effective October 1 and we also notified our box customers of a box price increase.","I will now turn it back to Mark.","Mark Kowlzan","Thank you, Tom. Looking at our Paper segment, EBITDA excluding special items in the third quarter was $59 million with sales of $293 million or an all-time record 20% margin compared to third quarter 2015 EBITDA of $46 million and sales of $292 million or a 16% margin. Paper segment price and mix was higher than the third quarter 2015 and the second quarter 2016. White paper sales volume was higher and pulp volumes were lower compared to the third quarter of 2015 while both papers sales volume and pulp volumes were up versus the second quarter of 2016. White paper prices improved during either quarter from continued realization of the previously announced price increases.","And finally, I want to mention that earlier in the fourth quarter we announced to employees at our Wallula, Washington mill that we will cease soft wood market pulp operations at the mill and permanently shut down the number one machine with pulp capacity of approximately 100,000 tons effective December 1, 2016. We expect margins at the mill and for the Paper segment to improve after completion of our shutdown plans.","I will now turn it over to Bob.","Bob Mundy","Thanks, Mark. Our third quarter 2016 effective tax rate of 35% was about the same as the second quarter and last year's third quarter. We currently expect the fourth quarter 2016 tax rate to be similar to the third quarter at about 35%.","Cash provided by operations in the third quarter was $217 million after deducting $75 million in cash tax payments and $50 million in pension payments. Other uses of cash include capital expenditures of $66 million, common stock dividends totaling $52 million and $27 million in term loan repayments. We ended the quarter with $280 million of cash on hand.","I will turn it back to Mark.","Mark Kowlzan","Thanks, Bob. On October 11, we announce that we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of Columbus Container Incorporated, an independent corrugated products producer in a cash free, debt-free transaction for a cash purchase price of $100 million. This acquisition is consistent with one of our key strategic focus areas we have discussed many times regarding increasing our vertical integration of containerboard through organic box volume growth and strategic box plant acquisitions.","We expect this acquisition to increase our integration by over 30,000 tons and will allow further optimization and enhancement of mill capacity as well as other benefits and synergies that we expect to begin realizing soon after closing. We believe that the acquisition will allow us to further enhance our strong balance sheet, financial results and cash flow consistent with our strategy to return significant value to our shareholders. We're on track to close the acquisition subject to certain customary conditions and regulatory approval later in the fourth quarter and we expect to finance the transaction with available cash on hand.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect seasonally lower volumes for containerboard and corrugated products which includes four less shipping days as well as seasonally less rich mix in corrugated products compared to the third quarter. However, we will have three months of TimBar activity in the fourth quarter versus only one month in the third quarter. In addition, as Tom mentioned, we did communicate price increases to our containerboard and box customers. ","While we don't comment on forward pricing, I would note that if the Industry Trade Publication increases the index for containerboard tomorrow, we would realize some of the benefit of a price increase during the fourth quarter but the vast majority of the benefits would be realized in the first quarter of 2017. We expect seasonally lower volumes and a less rich mix in white papers and with colder weather, wood, fuel costs are expected to be seasonally higher along with some price inflation on recycled fiber. Our annual outage costs will also be higher with the scheduled maintenance work at our Filer City, Michigan mill. ","Considering these items, we expect fourth quarter earnings of $1.15 per share and in addition as previously announced, we're on track to close the acquisition of Columbus Container during the fourth quarter. ","With that, we would be happy to entertain any questions. But I must remind you that some of the statements we have made on the call constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the Company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements.","With that, operator, I would like to open the call for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.","Chip Dillon","First question is actually related to TimBar. I was actually quite impressed with the volume increase that you reported basically implying it added 3.2% when you look at the overall and the organic growth with just one month. And as I kind of back into it, I just want to know if I am in the right ZIP Code here? While I think it helps your forward integration by around 200,000 tons as you indicated, it looks like that actually TimBar's cut up is maybe double that and you were already supplying them and therefore that helps us get our arms around some of the synergy opportunities. Is that roughly fair?","Tom Hassfurther","No, I think we indicated before when we talked about TimBar that we were not currently a supplier of TimBar. So all of those tons, that 200,000 tons is what they are bringing to our system.","Chip Dillon","Okay, okay, I got you. And then I guess as you look at Columbus, you mentioned that helps you integrate by about 30,000 tons. Is that also, are you not a supplier to them so that will all be incremental to them?","Mark Kowlzan","Correct. We're not currently a supplier and when we announced the TimBar acquisition, we basically called out that was worth about 6% of integration on an annualized basis and then this 30,000 tons at Columbus would be worth about 1% more integration on an annualized basis.","Chip Dillon","So that should certainly bring you well into the 90s I would think in terms of the overall?","Mark Kowlzan","Correct. If you think about going forward into next year with Columbus and TimBar and with some organic growth at whatever you assume we finish the year with our organic, we're a little bit north of 95% integration in 2017.","Chip Dillon","Got you. Okay. And then just quick follow-up. As you think about 2017 and recognizing that you are bumping up against your capacity at least on the board side, what should we think of CapEx? And would there be any opportunities to wring out more tons out of your mill system next year versus 2016?","Mark Kowlzan","We have obviously been identifying various opportunities for some accelerated creep. We always have a portfolio of opportunities available and with the acquisitions that we have got now, we're involved in, we certainly have a good opportunity to take advantage of some of the opportunities within the containerboard mills. So we will be accelerating some of that through 2017, 2018. ","And as you have seen historically for the past 16 years, these are not big amounts of capital. We're talking about $10 million, $20 million type opportunities in particular mills. And so we will call out the specifics on the January call for next year but again, nothing unusual out of that. It would be just what you have seen over 16 years of opportunity spending for a little more creep that we will acquire as time goes on.","Chip Dillon","And then just last one, the white paper results were certainly better I think for the second quarter in a row than what we were looking for and it seems like you really have good operations there. What are your thoughts in terms of next year? Is there any reason that you won't keep the operating efficiencies you have gotten and any thoughts on what your thoughts are long term? Any thoughts on the long term strategic importance of white paper to Packaging Corp?","Mark Kowlzan","Again, it is proven, it is generating a tremendous cash flow for us. It does not require any significant amount of capital to fix anything. The action I called out today on the closure of the pulp machine at Wallula actually helps us focus on the efficiencies of that mill in a much better manner. And so and as we called out almost a year ago back in the fall of 2015, every day we have our engineering and technology organization camped out in these mills along with the legacy containerboard mills working to improve efficiencies.","And so I fully expect as we have done through our history we will continue to wring benefits out of cost improvement and efficiency improvements and so very optimistic that we will continue on the path that we have been on. I am very pleased with what the white paper business is doing for us. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets.","Mark Wilde","I've got a couple of questions just around pricing. I know this is a sensitive issue so I will try and ask this carefully. But I noticed in the second quarter you guys had pointed to about a $0.04 share drag from lower containerboard and corrugated prices. And in the third quarter it is up to $0.13 which seems like an awfully big quarter to quarter move for that drag. Is there a mix element in there? Can you help us understand what changed just one quarter to the next?","Tom Hassfurther","Mark, this is Tom. Yes, there is a mix element in there. Our mix was less rich. There is no question about it so that was some of the impact. The other impact quite frankly is if you really look on the containerboard side on average 3Q of 2015 over 2016, you are talking about on average about a 30% drop in published prices, so down. So if you see that drop, I mean we try to hold off as much as we can but eventually that does impact the pricing containerboard in the domestic market.","Mark Wilde","Okay. The other when I was just curious about, Tom, if we go back to the first quarter there was that reduction in the Trade Paper price on liner of about $15 and there was a lot of commentary then about that drop was not big enough to kind of trigger some of the adjustment features in these box contracts. I am just curious now with containerboard prices slated to go up $50, will you wind up netting the whole $50 or do we need to kind of net some of that 2015 drop earlier against the $50?","Tom Hassfurther","Mark, I am not going to get into specifics about our contracts. But I can just tell you that there are a lot of different trigger mechanisms involved in these contracts. So in some cases yes, in some cases no and that is just the nature of those contracts.","Mark Kowlzan","Mark, you've got to appreciate we're dealing with probably 18,000 customers on the corrugated products, containerboard side of the business. Very complex.","Mark Wilde","Okay, understandably. The final question I had is, Mark, just in terms of your ability to kind of creep or debottleneck. Would you care to give us kind of an estimate of what you think is possible over the next two or three years? I think you have talked about 100,000 tons at DeRidder. But in total across the PCA system, what might the potential be?","Mark Kowlzan","I would rather wait until January to call that one. We're currently involved in an analysis right now. It involves capital spending and diminishing returns and where we're best getting our low-cost tons for our capital dollars spent. So we will be prepared to call that one out in January for you but we're confident we have got the capability to supply what corrugated products we will need through 2017 into 2018.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.","Scott Liebman","This is Scott Liebman in for Mark. Just one quick question for you on Columbus. So we see the acquisition is worth about $100 million and you cited about 30,000 incremental tons that you will be able to integrate through the system.","So face value when you compare that to the TimBar transaction, it seems a bit expensive but then when you went through and you showed us the adjusted EBITDA multiples of both, it actually turns out to be cheaper. So if you could talk a little bit just about what makes Columbus a higher margin business and then what about the business is unique and how will that fit into your existing operations?","Mark Kowlzan","We're not going to get into the details on that. We consider that proprietary but nevertheless, what attracted us to Columbus it is a very diverse, high-quality book of business that the enterprise has been able to build. Tom, do want to add to that?","Tom Hassfurther","We can't say much because we haven't closed yet. But the other thing is that I would just add they have a 30+ year reputation as being one of the very best in the marketplace. So they've got a great reputation for a long, long period of time.","Scott Liebman","Okay. And then you have talked about this a little bit earlier in the call but just quickly, you guys are known for continuous improvement from an operational efficiency standpoint in both containerboard and white paper. But specifically in containerboard, do you have any bigger projects like some of the energy projects that we have seen you do in the past on the horizon maybe not in the next year but past that that will be able to offset some of the input costs and labor inflation that we saw hit you guys this quarter and in the past?","Mark Kowlzan","The short answer is, yes. Again, we always maintain that portfolio of opportunities and then it is a matter of capital spending. And again, we dusted off the files and we're spending the next month or so to evaluate where these opportunities should be pursued. But again, as we have done for the less 16 years, we've got a nice portfolio of opportunities that will address those very things, energy, fiber consumption. So again, we're confident as we go forward we've got very high return [indiscernible] of capital spending dollars. But we will give you an update in January on this specifically.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo Securities.","Chris Manuel","I just have two topics I would like to touch on. One is kind of early integration or thoughts of what you are seeing within TimBar? I think as has been discussed, you have talked about 200,000 tons of integration opportunity. If memory serves, you felt you could kind of get there through the end of this year. I just wonder4d how the pace is with that? And then along the lines of Columbus Container as well, how long it takes to integrate those 30,000 tons? Is that something you can do pretty quickly after closing?","Mark Kowlzan","Yes, I am going to start and then I am going to let Tom finish it up. Again with 200,000 tons, we started moving through very quickly in September and now through this fourth quarter. As we finish up the year, we will have a very small amount that will wind itself in a contract in January but it is literally a few thousand tons. Tom, do you want to add some color to that?","Tom Hassfurther","I would just add that we're only about 30 days into this business but it is certainly delivering exactly what we had hoped for and the integration is going very smoothly. You also asked about Columbus Container and how soon we can integrate. Again, we haven't closed on that yet so that is going to be difficult to speculate but I would anticipate that one will go very smoothly post closing.","Chris Manuel","The second topic I wanted to ask about was the Papers business. When I look sequentially 3Q to 4Q, last year there was quite a drop. It was close to I think $20 million almost down sequentially. The year before it was closer to $10 million, $11 million. I know there is always a lot of moving parts but if you could just give us a sense as to does it look more like last year, does it look more like 2014 with respect to how you would anticipate the Papers business performing in 4Q? Or maybe what some of the factors are that would help us think about that?","Mark Kowlzan","Let me qualify that very simply. Last year we were faced with the very large expensive outage at Jackson Mill. Last year was our year to fix Jackson. We put in a new bottom or a recovery boiler, that was almost a month of downtime on that boiler. We went through the mill from top to bottom and put a lot of corrective action in the facility. So it was an enormous undertaking last year in 2015 so that is what brought that earnings down for the Paper business in the fourth quarter. Bob, do want to quantify that a little bit?","Bob Mundy","Yes, a little bit too on the price side, the price and mix side of things, it was obviously going down whereas this time, Chris, that certainly should not be the case.","Chris Manuel","But it will be down quarter to quarter just due to mix seasonality testing--","Bob Mundy","Yes, you will have your normal seasonality and whatnot. But just keep in mind too, as Mark mentioned, we're shutting down the number one machine at Wallula, the pulp volume which is in our volume numbers too. So that will be a bit of a drag from a volume perspective and if you are just doing a comparison quarter to quarter.","Mark Kowlzan","But the magnitude won't be nearly as significant as what we saw a year ago in 4Q.","Chris Manuel","Maybe just one thought on as you look into 2017 on capital allocation, you have a history of continuing to raise dividends. But how do you feel about balancing between other opportunities you see in front of you with respect to more acquisitions or repurchase? Any thoughts there?","Mark Kowlzan","Again, we're as we talked about earlier through the year and through the summer, we're in growth mode. We will continue to look at high-quality corrugated products acquisitions. We will continue to look at capital spending within the mills and in the box plants that have higher return, high justification. And then again with the generation of cash and where we're with that, we will continue to look at what is meaningful and sustainable in terms of dividends.","And so we have a nice balanced approach, nothing has changed and so we will go into next year and we will again be mindful of capital. I don't care how much cash you generate, you can only spend so much capital efficiently and we understand that. So I think again, January earnings call will be the time to talk more specifically about capital.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies.","Phil Ng","Can you provide a little color on how demand trends is tracking in October? And just any thoughts on inventory going into the fourth quarter for you or the broader market? I think there has been some commentary that Hurricane Matthew led to some downtime for perhaps some of your other competitors in the South. Any color on either one of those fronts would be great.","Tom Hassfurther","I'll just talk about Hurricane Matthew real quick. I will take the second half of that real fast. Yes, there was some downtime associated with that, not in our paper mills but as announced in some others. But as far as our impact goes, we did have some plants that were down for a few days. We also had some customers that had facilities down for as much as a week. So there is some impact there. It is yet to be determined what that will be down the road. Mark, do want to handle the--?","Mark Kowlzan","Where we're with the first 10 days again, it is only 10 days through October but in the legacy system we're up 3% and if you put on some TimBar, we're rolling up to basically 6% to 7% for the first 10 days with TimBar included.","Phil Ng","And then I guess just the nature of your box contracts how it works from a pricing standpoint, how much is that simply contractually tied to the movement of PPW versus you actually having to go out there and push [indiscernible] prices? I just want to understand how the mechanics of that and obviously we will be looking at what PPW publishes this Friday but just the mechanics please.","Mark Kowlzan","We're not going to get into the details of that. That is all speculative and again as I mentioned earlier, we've got about 18,000 customers, a very complex array of arrangements and agreements and so that is proprietary within our business.","Phil Ng","Just one last one for me just from a downtime standpoint, I mean I guess you called out some potential impact from Matthew for fourth quarter. Any impact for 3Q? And how should we think about year-over-year standpoint just because every year it changes a little bit in terms of just the timing and the magnitude of the downtime whether if you could call out from a tons perspective or maintenance expense standpoint, that would be great.","Mark Kowlzan","Bob, why don't you go ahead on that one?","Bob Mundy","For 2017, we will give you some insight on that, Chris, during the January call.","Phil Ng","And the fourth quarter?","Bob Mundy","The fourth quarter of this year?","Phil Ng","Yes.","Bob Mundy","We had the fiber mill as an outage so that will be moved from 3 to 4, that will be a bit of a drag.","Mark Kowlzan","It was worth $0.03 to us in additional maintenance costs for the quarter.","Phil Ng","Okay.","Mark Kowlzan","We called that out. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Securities.","George Staphos","I want to come back to the question of vertical integration and paper production recognizing that you are in the process of now reviewing projects and you will have clearly more color for us on the January call. But given your comments today, it would seem like you can run your business more or less as you would like through 2017 and then maybe into 2018.","But then at that point a more substantive action would have had to have occurred within your mill system. And I'm just kind of going back through my notes, I think you were answering Mark's question, would you agree with that point or am I putting too fine a point on the discussion?","Mark Kowlzan","This is like revisiting the 2011, 2012 period, we found ourselves that that same high-class problem where integration was approaching the 92% level, 93% level and we were creeping and we looked at the runway and we knew that at the rate of growth that we were anticipating we needed to look at a substantially larger runway containerboard supply, hence Boise fell into the equation.","And so we find ourselves back at that type of a thought process. And again, we have got different levers to pull to get there and obviously opportunities including down the road over the next few year's acquisition opportunities for mill assets if they are available and at the right price. A whole host of opportunities could pan out in that regard.","George Staphos","Understood, Mark. On that same line of questioning, if I look at return on capital the last few years after the improvement you got after Boise, return on capital has been relatively flat. That being said, prices for your largest product have been down somewhat and so that masks the comparison.","So do you think with the projects that you are looking at organically that the returns on them qualitatively are as good as past projects that you have had? Is the portfolio as robust from a margin or return standpoint as what you have seen in past years? And again, recognizing that you are just beginning to dust off that binder as you put it earlier as we speak?","Mark Kowlzan","Again, you know, you go back over the 20-year history, we have looked at our opportunities as a long term event and a return from a return point of view brings value going forward. So yes, the portfolio that we have for energy projects, general efficiencies are of the same returns that we would expect and the benefits whether it is just pure efficiency improvement or volume capacity improvement. So we remain very judicious in how we evaluate those projects and the returns.","And again, that is why you get to a point -- it is no secret you will arrive at a point very quickly if you are not careful of a diminishing return on a project so you can't fall in love with a monster. And that is where you look at some of the underperforming mill assets that are available as we have a reputation for being extremely good operators.","And we've got a team of people that we can move in place and deal with this. So again, that is how we look at the world. But we've got great opportunities with our capital spending as we go forward but we're mindful of what the limits are.","George Staphos","Last question for me. Just as we look at the fourth quarter guidance and recognizing some of these points you may not want to talk to specifically to if at all, with that as a caveat, what should we infer from your guidance in terms of what you might have built in for incremental D&A given the TimBar acquisition? Specific to TimBar again recognizing you didn't call it out so our guess is you don't want to speak too specifically to the accretion that you are getting from that. ","Would fourth quarter TimBar accretion be more substantive than what you saw in the third quarter just because you have more months or would there be any reasons why it wouldn't be as accretive to you 4Q versus 3Q? And on pricing, I just want to be clear would it be fair to say you have some impact of positive pricing in your fourth quarter guidance, Mark, without getting too specific? Whatever you can share there would be helpful. Thank you, guys.","Tom Hassfurther","Again on the TimBar piece, the answer is yes, we do expect to see improved contribution. We're not going to quantify that for you but we did say that earlier. So the answer is yes, we should and would expect to see an improvement. On the other question, Bob, do you want to get into that one on price?","Bob Mundy","Yes, on your question was on price about, yes. We certainly as Tom has indicated, we have announced price increases to our containerboard and our box customers. And so yes, so we may have to have an assumption for what we think that will do for us for the fourth quarter.","George Staphos","Okay and the incremental D&A 3Q to 4Q, if you can put a finer point on that, guys? Thank you.","Bob Mundy","It will be up slightly, nothing large but it will be up just a bit.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup.","Anthony Pettinari","Just following up on George's question, understanding you can't talk about forward pricing. When you look at previous box price increases, how many months after the board hike assuming we get it October 1, how many months before you achieve kind of the full run rate price improvement that you ultimately were able to achieve? Is it possible to say?","Mark Kowlzan","Yes, I'm going to lead Tom talk around that again. Obviously for antitrust reasons, we're careful about what we say. But, Tom, do want to go ahead?","Tom Hassfurther","Yes, Anthony, let me see if I can just summarize this to kind of get the complete answer to this question at least from PCA's point of view. Whenever there is a price increase as we have talked about in the past, we take an incredibly disciplined approach to that. And although we haven't had an increase in some 3.5 years, we certainly haven't forgotten how to be very disciplined in our efforts. We have notified our containerboard customers of the $50 per ton increase effective 10-1 and we began billing 10-1.","We also notified our box customers of a box price increase effective 10-1. The implementation of that increase is underway but as you know, we have a number of accounts that are large accounts that are tied to contracts primarily pulp and paper and those contracts have various trigger mechanisms. They will roll in primarily over the next 90 days. So I can't break it out specifically about what is going to happen each single month but just rest assured that providing this thing goes as we plan, we will primarily get most of it over the 90-day period.","Anthony Pettinari","Maybe just following up on Columbus Container. There was some news over the summer they purchased some land in Indiana and were planning a major expansion project. I think they flagged up to $30 million. Is that project attractive to you? Does it factor into one of the reasons that you are purchasing them? Can we add it to 2017 CapEx? Any kind of thoughts there?","Mark Kowlzan","You know what, obviously that is proprietary. We're not going to get into that plus again as Tom mentioned earlier, we haven't completed the acquisition yet so we're not in a position to talk about that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays.","Scott Gaffner","First question was really just around your external shipments within the packaging business in the quarter. You said they were up 15,000 tons. I think before you were pulling back a little bit from the export market to supply your domestic business. But just trying to figure out there was there some sort of pre-buy ahead of the $50 announced price increase or any shift in strategy around external shipments of containerboard there?","Mark Kowlzan","Let me start that and Tom can finish it up. When you come out of first and second quarter of the year, we're heavy into the annual shutdown so intentionally pull back and trim back some of the outside sales to make sure that our own box plants are well supplied. Coming out of that period of time in the July, August, September period, mills are running full so we virtually have a full capacity system up and running and we have more supply available to the market. And it just so happened that we had the orders and we had the supply so we were able to accommodate that. Tom, do want to add some color to that?","Tom Hassfurther","Yes, listen, we have in some cases running full, we're just trying to stay up with demand and there is really very little room for extra tons to be bought prior to this price increase. So I don't see any creep either.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. I guess when I look at box shipments, this is industry data, food and beverage is about 50% of the overall industry shipments and most food producers have been dealing with 18 months of deflationary issues on their input costs. And now we've got on the board a $50 price increase in containerboard and maybe that is a 7% to 8% price increase on the corrugated side of the business. What gives you confidence that they would be willing to accept a price increase at this point in time given the other input cost deflation?","Mark Kowlzan","We're not going to get into that. That is speculative and we can't talk about that.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. Just one last one then just around the price increase, you noted obviously the effective date October 1 for the containerboard. On the corrugated, you don't give an exact date. Is that because you are out negotiating with these 18,000 customers on various timeframes? Is that why you don't have a point estimate of the increase date?","Tom Hassfurther","I did give you, Scott, an increase date. We notified our box customers of a box price increase effective 10-1.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank.","Debbie Jones","I wanted to talk -- just I will ignore price for a second -- I want to talk a little bit just about mix. I do think you did actually guide to lower price and mix quarter-over quarter year-over-year and some of that was expected. But the mix I get the impression was maybe a little bit worse. And I wanted to understand if that was your experience or also if that is something that should be sustainable going forward if there is a mix shift in your business overall?","Tom Hassfurther","Debbie, mix can move all over the map quite frankly. There is not any big dramatic change other than the fact you might have graphic sales that move up earlier in the year, later in the year depending on any given year. Also with the Boise acquisition, we picked up a large segment of ag business that we didn't have in the past up in the Pacific Northwest and that business moves quite dramatically too especially in the quarter as the crops come in.","And depending on weather conditions, etcetera. they suffered a severe drought in the previous year, that impacted some crops this year as well. So those are the sorts of things that can occur but there is nothing you can read into that that says there is some dramatic mix shift permanently going forward.","Debbie Jones","So if I were to look to Q4 or the first half of next year, I shouldn't look to be modeling in a lower mix in your corrugated business?","Tom Hassfurther","Whatever the demand comes in is what the demand comes in. I can't predict weather changes, I can't predict what retailers decide to do regarding displays, etc. So it is very difficult to predict but it is a moving target. But overall over the long period of time, it usually evens out.","Debbie Jones","So your guidance in fourth quarter though is for kind of a stable mix?","Mark Kowlzan","What we called out was a normal seasonal downturn in mix. We always see a fairly big drop off in the November, December months.","Debbie Jones","Just last question, you talked about potentially looking forward that you may need to look to acquire some mill assets. Are there assets available for you that make sense in your system just given where your capacity is on the box plant side? If you could just comment on what you see there?","Mark Kowlzan","Again, I don't want to get into any speculations there. Again we know there are always opportunities that exist and we have a lot of flexibility in how we approach that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with Davidson.","Steve Chercover","I doubt this would be an effective counter strategy but I am wondering if any of your customers have said they would shop their tons or their business to avoid the price hike?","Mark Kowlzan","We're not going to talk about that.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with ROE Equity Research.","Gail Glazerman","I apologize for beating a dead horse but you did talk about being in growth mode and that you would consider looking at other corrugated acquisitions. How hard and fast I guess is your low 90s integration target in that perspective? I mean if another TimBar came up would you be comfortable doing it even if it meant that you had to buy board on the market without kind of an obvious near term outlet for internalizing that?","Mark Kowlzan","I am going to answer that theoretically. If another TimBar high-quality opportunity came along, we would certainly go after that aggressively like we did with TimBar. We have means to acquire the tons and we're comfortable with where we're so that is how I want to answer it.","Gail Glazerman","Okay. Can you talk a little bit about the export markets? I think you mentioned pricing was relatively sequentially stable, is that something that you are seeing continuing into the fourth quarter?","Tom Hassfurther","Yes, I will give you a little update on the export market. South America, Latin America, Mexico, we have announced a price increase in those markets. Overall demand is improving there. Europe is stable both regarding demand and price. Asia demand is slightly lower but everyday pricing wise is fairly stable. So globally I think you can say that it is fairly stable with the exception of some markets that are tending to move up.","Gail Glazerman","Okay. Just last couple of questions on costs. The freight improvement that you have been posting the last couple of quarters, how much of that is from internal initiatives versus I guess external factors? What trends do you see moving forward over the next quarter or two?","Mark Kowlzan","A significant portion of that is just from our own internal optimization efforts and how we have set up our lanes and will work with the various facilities and various carriers. The majority of that is our own initiative.","Gail Glazerman","Okay. Would you expect to see continued freight savings moving forward just based on what the market dynamics are doing?","Mark Kowlzan","Again, there is a lot of moving pieces to that so it would be just speculation.","Gail Glazerman","Okay. Can you break down your fiber trends a little bit between recycled and wood and I guess particularly, what you are seeing in would costs?","Mark Kowlzan","Wood has been fairly flat. Again you will get into the seasonal variations with winter weather activity depending on if there extreme moisture within regions. Other than that, we're just into the normal seasonal uptick. Recycle obviously has moved up. If you go year-over-year with what recycled fiber has done, we're up obviously. And so recycled fiber obviously becomes a much more significant cost item on our radar than been virgin fiber.","Gail Glazerman","Okay. Just one last quick one. The uncertainty you referenced around the hurricane, I presume in terms of Packaging Corp that is baked into the guidance that you have given the 115 for the fourth quarter?","Mark Kowlzan","Yes.","Operator","You have a follow-up question from the line of Chip Dillon.","Chip Dillon","A couple of questions related to the industry. One is there has been a very definite dichotomy in the last three years between the box shipments and square feet and the consumption of the board reported by the FDA to make those square feet. Since we measure capacity and production in tons and supply, I imagine we should at least consider the demand in tons and so far this year, it is about a 1% difference. So the boxes are getting heavier out there and I didn't know if you could offer your thoughts as to why that is happening?","Secondly, it looks like when you back into the unaccounted for tons, the amount has, it looks like the in-transit inventories have really come in really hard in the last couple of months and I didn't know if you were seeing that in your system with delivery schedules, etc.?","Mark Kowlzan","Tom, why don't you go ahead and handle that first part on the bases weights and box weights?","Tom Hassfurther","Industry data which showed that the boxes have stayed the same or gotten slightly lighter over a period of time. If there has been any short term trend or anything like that, that just revolves around some short term demand trends, Chip. But I don't, I think that we continue, we get a lot of comparisons with Europe and this sort of stuff then why is the U.S. doing certain things? We have talked about this in the past.","We make board basically to perform to whatever standards that the customer needs it to perform to and we have a completely different distribution system, different warehousing system, etc. than virtually any place in the world. So it puts a lot of requirement on that box to perform. But I think that from a basis weight standpoint, it has gotten slightly lighter over a longer period of time period of time.","Chip Dillon","I know that is true for the weight of the board, that is true but the boxes are clearly getting heavier, you can see in the FBA data and I just wonder if with lighter weight board you have weaker board and you got to use more plies and therefore the irony is with the lighter weight board are the boxes out there getting heavier because people have to double and triple wall since they are using on the margin lower quality board or is that not something you are seeing?","Mark Kowlzan","It doesn't apply to us number one because we're not producing that kind of board or using that kind of board in the marketplace. I am sure in the case of 100% recycled sheets and 100% recycled liner board, there is a definite possibility you might have to use a lot more fiber in order to get the performance. So if that is your case, that is probably true. It is just not impacting PCA because we're not in that market.","Chip Dillon","And then on the transit inventory?","Mark Kowlzan","Regarding that question, we really don't have a good answer for you on that. We look at that also in the same way you do and we don't fully understand what that number implies.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weintraub with Buckingham Research.","Mark Weintraub","Just a couple of clarifications. First off, I believe you indicated that 4Q maintenance outage expense would be $0.03 higher than 3Q. Is that correct?","Mark Kowlzan","Yes.","Mark Weintraub","Second, in answer to one of the questions on the timing of how containerboard flows through into boxes, maybe I misheard but I thought you referenced a box price increase for 10-1. I believe that would be a board price increase for 10-1 not a box price increase. I don't think that was to be referenced 10-1. Am I correct there?","Tom Hassfurther","Mark, this is Tom. We announced both container board and boxes for 10-1.","Mark Weintraub","Okay, interesting. And then when you were talking about -- there was a question on pre-buy and you basically suggested that from your perspective were basically no tons available out there. So is it fair to say you would characterize current conditions in the industry as quite tight?","Mark Kowlzan","Again, I didn't say that there wasn't a pre-buy. We just didn't really perceive it as pre-buy. And yes, if you want to go back to operating rates, if you think about what the latest FDA numbers are and the industry numbers for operating rates and where we're operating, we're operating both.","Mark Weintraub","And then also I just was trying to make sure I understood there was a reference earlier about that $0.04 move in the impact from corrugated pricing and mix in the second quarter and then $0.13 in the third quarter. And the answer to the question, I apologize for asking for you to repeat it again, but I heard a reference to $30 per ton or something but I believe the liner price is now $15 per ton and pulp and paper. So I wasn't quite sure if I again misheard on that one?","Tom Hassfurther","Yes, Mark, liner is down 15 over that period and medium is down 60. So if you average those you have got a downturn of $30 a ton Q3 over Q3.","Mark Weintraub","Okay, great.","Tom Hassfurther","That is how much the published price is.","Mark Weintraub","Understood. So hence the reference to the domestic board sales that you would have because you are obviously selling both liner and medium. And I realize this may be competitive and you don't want to answer it fine but box prices, are they typically tied to a combination of the two or more to liner, can it be all over the place?","Tom Hassfurther","Again we have said many times whatever we do price-wise is between us and our customers. So we really don't comment on that.","Operator","Mr. Kowlzan, I see that there are no more questions. Do you have any closing comments?","Mark Kowlzan","I want to thank everybody for joining us on the call today and look forward to talking with you in January for the full-year and the fourth quarter earnings update. Have a good day. Thank you.","Operator","Again, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's call."],"16948":["Packaging Corp. of America (NYSE:PKG) Q2 2017 Earnings Call July 27, 2017  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Thomas A.

Your host today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chief Executive Officer of PCA. Upon conclusion of his narrative, there will be a question and answer session.","I will now turn the conference call over to Mr. Kowlzan, and please proceed when you are ready.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning, and thanks you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's second quarter 2017 earnings release conference call. I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA, and again with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President who runs our Packaging business and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer.","I'll begin the call with an overview of our second quarter results, and then turn the call over to Tom and Bob, who'll provide more details. I'll then wrap things up and then we'll be glad to take your questions.","Yesterday, we reported second quarter 2017 net income of $143 million or $1.52 per share. Excluding special items, second quarter net income was $144 million or also $1.52 per share, compared to the second quarter 2016 net income of $118 million or $1.25 per share.","Second quarter net sales were $1.6 billion in 2017, and $1.4 billion in 2016. Total company EBITDA for the second quarter, excluding special items was $328 million in 2017 and $290 million in 2016.","Excluding special items, the $0.27 per share increase in second quarter 2017 earnings, compared to the second quarter of 2016 was driven primarily by higher prices and mix of $0.25, sales volume, $0.09 and production volumes of $0.03 in our Packaging segment, lower annual maintenance outage costs of $0.05 and lower taxes, $0.06 and the partial insurance recovery related to the DeRidder Mill incident for $0.02. These items will partially offset by higher energy cost of $0.06, fiber, $0.05, labor $0.03 and chemicals $0.01, higher freight $0.02, interest $0.02 and depreciation $0.02 and other expenses $0.01 and also lower Paper segment prices and mix for $0.01.","Our results were $0.07 per share better than the second quarter guidance, primarily due to higher Packaging segment sales prices and volume, a lower tax rate of $0.03 and a partial insurance recovery related to the DeRidder incident for $0.02. These are partially offset by higher recycled fiber prices of $0.01.","Looking at our Packaging business for the second quarter of 2017, EBITDA, excluding special items of $303 million with sales of $1.3 billion, resulted in a margin of 23.1% versus last year's EBITDA of $267 million and sales of $1.1 billion, or 23.7% margins.","The containerboard mills produced 947,000 tons in the second quarter, driven by strong demand and the need to supply our growth in box shipments, as well as the rapid integration of our new corrugated plants from the TimBar and Columbus Container acquisitions. We also successfully completed scheduled outages at our three largest containerboard mills.","Although, higher recycled fiber prices of almost $90 million and higher energy prices of $5 million negatively impacted the mills compared to last year's second quarter, improved the usage of recycled fiber and fuels helped to mitigate some of that impact.","I'll now turn it over to Tom, who'll provide more details on the containerboard sales and our corrugated business.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Thank you, Mark. Corrugated products shipments in total were up 10%, with one less workday or 11.7% per workday, compared to last year's second quarter. Our outside sales volume of containerboard was up almost 5,000 tons versus last year's second quarter, but down over 9,000 tons versus the first quarter of 2017.","Overall, Packaging segment demand remained very strong with volumes contributing $0.12 per share above last year's second quarter and $0.07 above the first quarter of 2017, even with excellent containerboard production from our mills. Due to the continuing strong demand, we ended the quarter with containerboard inventories, including the inventory needs of our two acquisitions, 25,000 tons below the second quarter of 2016 and over 14,000 tons below the first quarter of 2017.","Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.22 per share above the second quarter of 2016, and up a $0.11 per share compared to the first quarter of 2017 as we continued to implement our announced price increases during the quarter. Export containerboard prices were $0.03 per share above the second quarter of 2016 and up $0.02 per share compared to the first quarter of 2017. I'll now turn it back to Mark.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Thanks, Tom. Looking at our Paper segment, EBITDA, excluding special items in the second quarter was $43 million, with sales of $254 million or 17% margin, compared to the second quarter 2016 EBITDA of $39 million and sales of $267 million or 15% margin. We mentioned on our last quarter's call that a key price index for all major uncoated freesheet rates had dropped $20 per ton in February. And as expected, our second quarter 2017, Paper segment prices and mix were lower compared to last year's second quarter, as well as the first quarter 2017.","Seasonally, industry uncoated freesheet volumes in the first quarter and second quarters are similar and ours were up slightly versus last year's second quarter as well as the first quarter of 2017. Our pressure sensitive volumes were down slightly versus both periods.","I'll now turn it over to Bob.","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","Thanks, Mark. Looking at a few of the other earnings share variances compared to last year and our guidance, our second quarter of 2017 recurring effective tax rate of 31.3% was almost 3.5% below the last year's second quarter. This was primarily due to adoption of new accounting guidance related to employee share-based payments, which took effect beginning in 2017. This key \u2013 the key of accounting change required all excess tax benefits or efficiencies of share-based payment awards, including dividends paid on those awards, to be recognized in the income statement when the awards pass.","Previously, this was reported in the equity section of the balance sheet. While we anticipated some benefit in the second quarter, when almost all of our employees grants vest, the fact that our stock price grows to almost 25% from the time we prepared our guidance, together with unanticipated favorable tax law changes in a couple of states, the benefit came in $0.03 per share above our expectations. We expect our third and fourth quarter rates to be what you would normally see, have been under 35%. But our full year rate for 2017 now looks to be just under 34%, which would be at least 1% below our 2016 full-year rate.","Also, as mentioned when providing our second quarter 2017 guidance of $1.45 per share, this did not include any potential additional cost or anticipated recoveries related to the DeRidder Mill insurance claim. Discussions are continuing with our insurance carrier, but of the estimated $0.07 per share that impacted our first quarter 2017 recurring earnings, we were able to record a partial recovery of $0.02 per share during the second quarter. Our estimate of total property damage and business interruption losses, including capital costs, remains in the range of $20 million to $25 million.","Moving on, cash provided by operations during the quarter was $221 million. Uses of cash include capital expenditures of $82 million, common stock dividends totaling $59 million and $2 million in term loan repayments. We ended the quarter with $321 million of cash on hand.","Finally, our planned annual maintenance outages for the balance of the year is unchanged from our previous guidance, with an impact of $0.11 per share in the third quarter and $0.23 per share in the fourth quarter, still totaling $0.51 per share for the year.","I'll now turn it back over to Mark.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Thanks, Bob. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect to realize the vast majority of our previously announced Packaging segment price increases and we expect higher Packaging segment shipments resulting from strong demand.","White paper sales volumes should be seasonally higher, although price and mix should be moving lower and scheduled outage cost of the Paper segment will be higher. We also anticipate continued price inflation in recycled fiber and certain chemicals, higher freight costs and higher tax rate. Considering these items, we expect the third quarter earnings of $68 per share. This does not include any potential additional costs or anticipated recoveries that are related to the DeRidder Mill insurance claim.","With that, we'll be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. Statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC. The actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.","With that, Krista, I'll open up the call for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first quarter comes from the line of Chip Dillon from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes. Good morning, Mark and Bob.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning.","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And Tom as well. First question is on the really solid performance that we're seeing in the Paper segment , you mentioned, of course, that prices had dropped both, I think, sequentially and year-over-year and yet you were able to show higher margins. And I didn't know if you could give us a little help of what is causing that. Is it all operationally or did you shift some production to a lower cost machine?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Well, it really had to do with the outage schedule. As we had outlined this year, we had planned outage with the Wallula mill, as an example, in the third quarter, and IFalls will come in October. Traditionally, we used to shut International Falls down in June and Wallula would have a second quarter outage also. So, that's one big factor. And also, we also in terms of what would impact the EBITDA margins, don't forget we took the pulp business and eliminated that at the end of last year, and so that was a very low margin contribution to that segment. So, that's no longer in the equation. So, those two factors are really the difference.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. And then if you could just let us know, I don't know if Tom has some idea of what the organic volume improvement was. I know there is 10%, 11.7% per day. But, if you excluded Columbus and TimBar and other M&A moves, what would those numbers have been? And while you're at it, if you could let us know how the volumes looks so far this month?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Chip, this is Tom. I'm not going to break that out. I'll tell you why. As I explained last time, it's very hard for us to break out the organic now, because we move business around to take advantage of the synergies of these acquisitions and to maximize the profit potential. So, it's very hard for us to get a total grasp on what happened organically, so that's why we're reporting it in a total, but I will say that demand so far through 13 days of this month is running at about 14% increase, which is, of course, very good.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yeah. That's very helpful. The last one, then I'll turn it over is, Mark, if you could talk a little bit about what you see as the potential for the fleet that's out there, both yours and others in the white paper world, to be potential sources of new kraft linerboard capacity. And I say that noting that demand so far this year is up 3%.","You see virgin board prices outside of North America going up almost every three months and we've had two increases here in the last year. And some of us think we could be close to running out in the next couple of years. So, given that it's difficult to permit new mills, what are your thoughts about white paper mills being converted?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","It's something that the industry has talked about. We talked about it for the last few years. There are a handful of potentially good mills that could be converted, primarily because of the wood basket they're in. And so, you have to consider that as a primary factor in the conversion opportunity, besides the amount of capital it takes to convert the asset. And so, the capital required is a given. And then the ability to fiber the mill with the right kind of fiber at the right prices is the other major factor, so there are a few mills that fit that criteria.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Got you. Thank you.","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, Bob. Good morning, Mark, Tom.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning, Mark.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Mark, is it possible to get an update on your plans for kind of debottlenecking down at DeRidder, where we stand and what the timeline looks like?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. Work is proceeding very well. A lot of the work that we had started on number one machine is progressing very nicely and we're seeing what we expected to see on the incremental improvements with DeRidder. Also the work that is planned that will give us the big incremental increase for next spring is still on track and that would be the press section rebuild in the new forming section work that we'll be doing. And so that will finish out the incremental activity that gives us the approximate 150,000 tons year-over-year, so. But everything's looking very good, and DeRidder is running very well, extremely pleased.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And that 150,000 tons would start to flow in the second half of next year?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Some of it's already flowing through work we did earlier in the year on the DeRidder number 1, as an example, and some of the work we did on DeRidder 3 is already flowing through. And then as we go forward, we will continue to make some of the improvements. Primarily it's pressing, drying-type enhancements that allow us to handle the available fiber we have. And so we are seeing some of that benefit this year already.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Then, Tom, I wonder if it's possible for you to talk, just in general terms, about the pace of the current box site. How you see it rolling in versus kind of past hikes?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Are you talking about price hike? Is that what you're talking about Mark?","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The box price hike.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The pace is exactly as we said it would be. As I said on the last call, the vast majority will roll in over 90-day period. So, our results in the second quarter show some of that increase. And we'll get the \u2013 great majority of the remainder in the third quarter with a few laggards that trigger at the beginning of the year.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And should that, Tom, should that net out to be more than the containerboard hike itself?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Well, yes. But keep in mind that, we're \u2013 for us, I mean, we may have a different set of circumstances that somebody else may have relative to all the contracts and all those sorts of things that go on and the number of accounts that we have in addition to the smaller accounts we have, which are negotiated each time a price movement takes place.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. All right, and then my last question is just there's this supplemental corrugating medium hike out in the market. I think it's $30 on an average. Will that have any effect on PCA?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Mark, we're such a small player in the external domestic medium market. We probably, move less than 50,000 tons a year of medium out into the North American system. So, we're such a small player, but the fact is, yes, our price has gone up accordingly...","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","...seeing in the index.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. All right. It sounds good, guys. I'll turn it over.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Thank you.","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please, go ahead.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Morning, George.","Operator","One moment please. Mr. Staphose, please go ahead.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Can you hear me okay?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah.","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning George.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning George.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Good morning again, everybody. Piggybacking on Mark and Chip's questions, can you talk at all to the extent, which priorities are maybe, moving or which of the potential solutions to your vertical integration high-class problem are rising and which might be less of a priority, and to the extent that maybe you can't talk per se to that, can you talk about other projects, other initiatives that might be underway to improve returns, either in the mills or the box plants we're beginning to see input cost starting to rise again. Are there any things in that regard that might be helpful to your returns over the next couple of years?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Okay. Regarding the first question about capacity, we're not going to get into the details on that as we've been talking for the last few months publicly. We obviously have an array on our metrics of opportunities that we're studying and evaluating. And when we've made some decisions, we're ready to announce. Obviously, we'll make that as a public announcement.","Regarding the opportunities within the mills right now, we obviously across the higher legacy fleet, we're working everyday to enhance the efficiencies and opportunities. But, keep in mind, as we've always said, that's more in line with a creep (20:54) opportunity.","And then I'll jump to this, you talked about some of box plants, some of the other opportunities. This is a capital spending question that somebody maybe wondering. We've identified a number of opportunities in the box plants side of the business with Tom, and we are funding a number of these projects. So, we had called out that the capital for the year would be somewhere in the $325 million area. Now, we're moving that up to the $350 million for the year target and that's to take advantage of the identified opportunities that these are high-return, low-risk opportunities to enhance the margin and the mix of the volume on the box plant side.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Mark, thanks for that color. I guess, one thing I wanted to turn to is, you would appear to be running relatively tight right now heading into the third quarter given your inventory position. Can you confirm that or correct that view. And, if you were in fact running a little bit tighter perhaps than you would have expected to aside from the obvious, what other things might you do to alleviate the production relative to the pull situation you've got right now in your corrugated system, again, a high-class problem.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Well, we're running right where we thought we would be. When we looked at the plan for 2017, and knowing what our shutdown schedule is looking like and what the box plant cut-off demand was going to be modeled as. We're pretty much right where we thought the inventories would be. That being said, you're right, we have to run extremely well, and yet historically we proven that's what we do well. And so pressure's on the folks in the mill side of the business to run extremely tight and that's what the plan is. But, yeah, we need every ton we can get out of our mills.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Two last ones and I'll turn it over. In terms of this quarter, even relative to the first quarter, it seemed like there's a little bit more pressure on you and I think now other companies in the sector results from input cost. Obviously, OCC is the headline pretty much every day, but also even from non-fiber based variable cost.","What can you comment to in terms of what pressure or benefit you're seeing there and the outlook for the second half of the year? Are you seeing any kind of freight or logistics challenges like we had a few years ago that you also have to manage against either logistically or potentially through other margin improvement efforts?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Energy is a key factor. If you go back a year ago, year-over-year 2Q\/2Q, energy is up $0.06, and freight is up $0.02 year-over-year. And so those are types of examples. And then you have \u2013 we called out chemicals. If you move into going from 2Q to 3Q, all right there's still some upward pressure on a little bit of the fiber with what we're seeing, but these are the type of the penny for this and a penny for that freight, but it's still in an upward trajectory, just slightly from where it has been. So, that's why we're calling it out. And that's about where it is. Year-over-year, it's really the natural gas rise that we slowly picked up throughout the system.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Mark, thanks for the thoughts. You know what? I'll turn it over to everybody else, and good luck in the quarter.","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","Thanks, George. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Ng from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning, Phil.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. When you think about M&A going forward, would you consider buying some of the uncoated freesheet mills you kind of called out that would fit that fiber basket as well as your current mill system on the white paper side, do they have that fiber basket that could make it interesting? I'm not saying you are moving forward. Can you just give us some of the parameters?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Let's stop there. I don't care to talk about it. Again, any discussion around that is proprietary and confidential. So, and then anything else is speculative.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Very nice. I guess pricing was pretty robust, more than offset cost I think for the most part in Packaging. So, I was a little surprised margins were flattish, which was good regardless. Was there any mixed dynamic in quarter? And just given the strength that you saw in box demand, did you have to buy little more board in the open-market?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Well, primarily, and Tom and Bob could weigh in on this too. But, if you think about the lagging that we have seen in the price increase, we saw the bleed off all the year along in 2016 for corrugated products. And then the price increase announcement last fall started to flow through, so we saw a primary benefit moving into the first quarter. And then this latest price increase is really a third quarter event. And, so that if you think about year-over-year, there is still that pressure on the pricing in the total margin. We haven't picked-up a full benefit. Bob, Tom, you want to weigh in on...","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","No. You are right. The recovery \u2013 the cost pain from the rough and (26:36) recycle and these other things happens quicker than the price relief comes through and \u2013 but as Tom said, the third quarter is, we'll get to do the vast majority of that and we would expect that to sort of flip in the third quarter.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Got you. That's helpful. And I don't know \u2013 exports in these open market tons are not a big portion of your business. But just given the strength that you're seeing here, I think, you called off 14% box shipments in July. Are you starting to pull back some of those open market tons and just repatriating those tons, because the spread is pretty attractive, I would imagine? Thanks.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","I'll let Tom talking little bit this, too, but as we called up earlier in the year, we look at those tons and we move the tons to the best opportunity. And so, we're very, very cognizant on it. Tom, you want to add a little color to...","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","I would just say that in the export market, I mean, we're taking care of those long-term customers that we've had and that we value and especially since they buy the specialty grades that we produce. We will take care of those people, but we're not actively pursuing additional business in the export market.","Mark W.

Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning, Anthony.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","You've had TimBar for about 10 months and I think Columbus for about 8. Are your integration and synergy activities are basically completed? Are you supplying basically all the board for the box plants systems. Just wondering if you could give us sense of what inning you are in for those integrations, and if there's some incremental benefits you might pull through in the second half?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. Tom, why don't you walk him through that one.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","All right. Our TimBar and Columbus acquisitions have gone very well. They're fully integrated. We're very pleased with the results. They continue to grow at, what we consider the PCA growth rates, and we've been able to, as I mentioned earlier, we've been able to move the business around, which has been very valuable to us in terms of some under synergy savings. So, we're very pleased with where that is.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then Tom, I thought this might be a difficult question to answer, but is it possible to estimate what percentage of your box volumes, it'd be moved through e-commerce or have exposure to e-commerce. And then also in the past you've talked about manufacturing, re-shoring, being a potential driver of demand, I guess Foxconn had their big announcement about big Midwestern plant. How much has manufacturing and industrial manufacturing renaissance been a driver for the very strong growth you've seen this year?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Anthony, let me talk about e-commerce first, because I get a lot of attention and I think a lot of people want to say that the increase in demand in boxes is generally driven by e-commerce. It certainly is a driver, but I don't think it's the only driver at all. Because, as you just mentioned, some of the re-shoring of manufacturing or what I would really consider at this point, it's been more of a retention of manufacturing base, which we've seen growth in some areas, bleed off in others, things like that. We're not seeing the bleed off as we would have seen in the past. They're staying here. And I think that's very helpful to the base of the business. And I think like e-commerce, they're a growth engine on top of that.","And then, as you mentioned, this Foxconn announcement that's coming out, which is a major facility moving into Wisconsin, at least that's the indication at this point in time. In addition to Samsung announced a big facility that's coming to the United States. So, I think the future is very bright in terms of box demand.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's great color. I'll turn it over.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","All right.","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. The line is open.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning, Debbie.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Starting off on what Anthony just said on demand trends, is there anything from like a regional perspective that you are noticing that is surprising to you? And then do you have any color on how trends have been through July?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Tom, why don't you go through that one?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Debbie, I would say on demand trends, the only thing that really I mean we're seeing right now is, I mean, we're seeing the recovery of the West Coast Ag market. So, the West Coast is definitely up for us. The remainder of the country is pretty steady in terms of demand and demand growth.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And anything on July?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Well, in July, we're having, as I said, we're up. We're trending up 14% right now, and that demand is pretty well evenly distributed across the country.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And then in Paper, typically, mix and volume improve seasonally. Can you just talk about kind of your confidence level on that and just remind us what exactly is driving that?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Well, third quarter is always the higher volume quarter, and traditionally, a richer mix quarter. But that being said, prices are down for the year, as the index has indicated earlier in the year. And so, back-to-school is always a big time in the third quarter. You've got all the school systems nationwide restarting, so that's what pushes volume on that side. So, in that regard, that's truly what drives the third quarter.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And just one quick one, this might be pretty simple but you have experienced higher freight cost, which I think is understandable, but is there anything in that that's related to availability or having issues getting freight?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","The availability isn't our concern right now. It's just the general increases in costs through the year. So, it's not like it was four, five years ago with driver and tractor trailer shortages.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you. I'll turn it over.","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","Thank you. Next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research. Please go ahead, the line is open.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you. So, the 14% and I realize it's only a few weeks, but that seems like a pickup even from the 10% to 12% that we had in the prior quarter. Are there some additional acquisitions that kind of are feeding into that number or is that indicative at least that your business has actually even picked up from the torrid pace (33:42) we were seeing?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","That's just our business in general, picking up and in a higher trajectory. So, we're very pleased with where we are.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","And, as you've been growing quite fast, has your customer base shifted at all? What I mean by that is, are you selling even more to local accounts, for instance, versus national or the other way around or any changes as you're going through this relatively fast growth?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","No. I mean, nationwide, if you look at our box plant footprint, we're seeing robust activity nationwide. And we're taking advantage of the TimBar and Columbus acquisitions and integrating those regional activities. So, again, that's the good news that we're not seeing it in any one area. It's across the board. And don't forget we've got an extremely large customer base, 18,000-plus customer nationwide. And so, it's a very well spread out nationwide activity. Tom, do you want to put a little more color on that?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","No. I don't have anything else to add.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Thanks so much.","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","All right. Thank you.

Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, gentlemen.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Morning.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Just a couple of follow-ups. One, kind of along the lines of previous question, you said 14% versus up 10%. Did you start to see an acceleration as the quarter went on or was that sort of all incremental in July? Can you remind us what you comps kind of look like the next couple? Are they still relatively simple or can we kind of annualize this rate until this is all through?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Chris, as Mark just mentioned, I mean, the demand has been substantially a pick up across the board. We usually have a pretty robust third quarter anyway.","Looking forward, though, is the 14% number if you look into the third quarter, I mean, we are going to have some little tighter comps, because TimBar came on in September. So, when you get to the September number in the month in that quarter, and you start to make those comparisons, I mean, this number comes down, because you now got TimBar in both years' comparison. So, we'll break some of that out for you and give you a little color on that in the next quarter.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Just two last questions. First was, when we think about the 150,000 tons that you've got kind of debottlenecking and work for that across your roughly 3.8 million rated tons is about 4%. Could you just maybe estimate for us, you mentioned, you had some of it already D1 and D3, with some improvements there, but do you feel you've got a quarter of that, half of that? How much of that do you think you have already kind of flowing through versus yet to come?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Just using a number, we probably get 50,000 tons of pick up this year out of all those projects on both machines, and then we'll get the balance of 100,000 tons next year, just...","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. That's helpful. Last question I had was with recycled mix. If memory serves, and correct me if I'm wrong, you use kind of 10% to 15% OCC into your part of your basket today, even though most of your paper comes out as kraft. With some of the changes of Chinese waste paper exporting in such, do you have an opportunity being that the rest of your mix, as you put that in there is pulp? If you have an opportunity to maybe, use some more waste paper versus OCC, how do you think about that mix or what it might do? Would it degrade the quality of what you'd have coming out or how do you think about that as an opportunity?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","You just summarized. Well, you got to be very careful about what you're putting into the furnish in regards what the impact on the quality is going to be. And so, I don't even want to speculate about that that kind of opportunity or what that means.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","All right. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson from KeyBanc. Please, go ahead. Your line is open.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning, Adam.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Mark, just one question, back to just Packaging margins for a second. I know you talked about all the OCC, energy, freight, chemical inflation that you've experienced. Were you expecting going into the quarter your margins to be flat or down or did you actually expect margin expansion knowing what you knew going into the quarter?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","We're right, where we expected to be. Because of what I told you about the leak-off last year, we had to overcome in the pricing alone. It is against the fiber in OCC contemplation and chemicals and energy. And so, we're right exactly where we thought we'd be.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And Tom, you talked about demand and the e-commerce impact and how much play that's getting. If you don't think, e-commerce is driving most or all the growth, what do you think, is driving up OCC, to the extent that is gone up? Do you think, it's half China, half e-commerce? What exactly, what do you think is going on? And, do you see any end in sight to this highly unusual OCC run we've seen.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Well. Let me first comment. I didn't say that e-commerce is not a growth engine. It is a growth engine. It's clearly a growth engine. Because if you just make the comparisons about deliveries to home of even let's say apparel as an example, apparel did not go in boxes when it went to big-box stores, but it does end up in a box when it comes to your home. So, that alone is a pick up for us.","And, but e-commerce is a lot bigger than just an Amazon as an example. I mean, e-commerce everybody's got e-commerce sites, everybody's, every day they're opening up new sites, everybody is trying to cut into what Amazon is doing to them et cetera. So it's a huge moving target and it's very hard to get your arms around it completely.","Now that said, moving to OCC, e-commerce clearly has an impact in OCC collection as well, because the big box stores used to collect all the corrugated, used to bale it and send it \u2013 ended up back at the mills. Today, you've got a lot of these boxes showing up at apartment building, condos, homes where the municipalities may not have collection. And, consequently, it ends up in landfill.","So, there has been a little bit of a curtailment in terms of the ability to collect. But we saw this trend in OCC coming way back in 2005-2006 timeframe, before the Great Recession hit. If you go back, you looked at collection rates and the demand, because all of the additional mill capacity that came on over the last few decades has all been 100% recycled. So at some point, there was going to be push comes to shove in terms of supply versus demand and we're at that point right now, where OCC is in very tight supply and consequently the prices remain high. And even when \u2013 a few months ago when China curtailed some of their purchases and everybody thought OCC would retreat back to levels that had taken place the previous six months. It didn't do that at all and came down a little bit. And then, as soon as China reentered the market, it went right back up. So, we think it's clearly going to be \u2013 it's going to be an issue.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So, you think essentially, we're in kind of a new paradigm for OCC now?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","I do. Yeah. I do. And I think that, as those people that know that business well, know that we collect up to 90% at this particular point in time, that last 10% is very expensive to get. So..","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Right.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","...OCC has \u2013 they priced significantly higher in order for people to have interest in getting into really what in essence is sorting trash and try to recover the paper from that.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So, just last question on that, so you don't think there'll be a huge push right now among recycling companies and others to try to collect more of the stuff?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Well, I think they're trying to collect all they can.","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. We're at an inflexion point of the opportunity, as Tom said, it's a diminishing return at this point...","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah.","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","It's just expensive to get...","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Well, yes, very expensive to collect beyond where we are right now.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Armstrong from Armstrong Investment. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","James Armstrong - Armstrong Investment Research","Good morning.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning, James.","James Armstrong - Armstrong Investment Research","In the quarter, could you remind us, what was your mix of virgin versus OCC? And, do you think you have any room to reduce your OCC usage further or are you pretty much maxed out on virgin?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","We're not giving the exact number. We're somewhere around 20% total usage of OCC week. We can move that up and down a few percent. But don't forget, running the mills full and with the demand we have, it's probably, if you look at the math map, it's in our best interest to use what we need to use for OCC and be okay to fill out that demand we have for containerboard. So, so it's somewhere around 20% and that's, well, we did obviously take advantage of our system this year, in fact, and we really stretched out our kraft capability in mills. And so, the 20% is a good number.","James Armstrong - Armstrong Investment Research","Okay. That works. Switching gears and coming back to capacity. If you were another producer to decide to convert a white paper mill, how long do you think it would take to complete that conversion? And can you compare that to what you believe, how long it would take for a greenfield operation?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Well, let me start with the greenfield operation, nobody's permitted a greenfield mill in decades.","James Armstrong - Armstrong Investment Research","Okay.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","And so, the likelihood of somebody trying to go through the permitting process and the site locations, that's probably a little probability.","On the other hand, if somebody was just starting to think about converting a facility, you're probably talking about couple of years. By the time, you would do your pre-engineering, your detailed engineering and order equipment, vertical pieces of equipment for paper machine conversion, pulp mill requirements a lot of this equipment now is up to 14- to 16-month delivery, just on the delivery phase of this, so it takes quite a while to do your engineering and scope the project out. So you're talking about couple of years and in many cases to do a good project.","James Armstrong - Armstrong Investment Research","Perfect that's exactly what I need.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","James, I'd also like to add that more important than even the mill or the potential fiber base, you better have a place to sell your output. So, the open market is so small today that, it'd be virtually impossible for somebody who doesn't have the integrated cut up (46:04) to go in and convert mill. And then try to find home for those tons.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Right. So, what Tom is saying is, if you think about just in the past year with the acquisitions of the independent box plants that the industry has been announcing. We've probably taken the independent activity down from probably 9% or 10% down to 5% or less of the open market containerboard purchasing.","James Armstrong - Armstrong Investment Research","Perfect. That's exactly what I needed. Appreciate it.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Okay. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning, Scott.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just a follow-up question on inventory, you seem to be relatively tight on inventory now. And, I think, normally you would build some inventory this time of the year in anticipation of a strong 4Q trend or 4Q demand, or 4Q has been stronger recently than it has been in the past. How you think about the inventory position sort of as you move through 3Q and 4Q?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Well, it's a high-class problem right now. We got to run well and just keep running well. So, the point you're making, the fourth quarter is no longer a seasonal downturn that the industry used to see, but that's been going on for about \u2013 a better part of a decade now that the 3Q is always your highest volume quarter and a better \u2013 richer mix. But 4Q, because of the holiday activity is actually requiring us to run just as hard. So, good news is, we've got to run hard, we try to meet the tons. So, plan right now is to get ourselves back in balance and keep running well to supply what the box plants need.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","No absolute \u2013 we have a range of our inventory tons and we know when we come out of the annual shutdowns and we're moving there, but also the key is, the box plant demand. It's, I'll use the term, a high-class problem to have.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Sure. Maybe a follow-on to that for Bob. How should we think about working capital associated with inventory, because as you got tight inventory situation, but you have the prices increases coming through the system, how should we think about inventory as a source or use of cash for the year?","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","Well, I think, to Mark's point, producing to meet the box demand and keeping those in sync, we don't see a lot of movement up or down with inventory. So you wouldn't get one or the other.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Last one from me, just on input cost. We've talked about a lot of inflationary pressures, but what about virgin pricing trends? Are you seeing anything there as far as deflationary trends on virgin fiber pricing?","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","Year-over-year, that's been the bright spot. If you look nationwide across our legacy system, we've seen from the 2016 timeframe into this year, while we've seen some price decreases, it is primarily related to weather events, rain, winter activity. And so, we have one mill location in the South that's had a little bit more rain this spring. And we saw some uptick in the (49:45) at that particular location for a few months. But in general, across the board year-over-year, what's helped us mitigate the OCC, DLK price impact has been the fact that we've been able to buy at better pricing year-over-year on virgin, so that's been a positive so far. But again, that can change in a heartbeat with hurricanes, tropical storms, and winter weather. But so far, it's been positive.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","A lot of discussion today about the recent demand trends, which obviously are strong and your commentary around the go-forward seems fairly constructive there and your commentary around OCC, maybe being in a new paradigm, also seems to make it clear that the world's going to probably need some more virgin capacity at some point. Was wondering if you could follow upon James' question and your response there and provide some color on what you think the capital cost might be on a conversion like you were talking about. And would you comment on whether you think the current margins in the industry are attractive enough to justify that kind of an (51:10) investment, acknowledging that it would be a little bit risky, because it would take a couple of years to come online and the world's an uncertain place?","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","That's a very speculative question, because depending on what quartile you wish to achieve a conversion ultimately end up, and also, as Tom said, assuming you have a home for these tons and where are those tons going, you'd have to run the math. But taking an older bleached mill, white mill into a containerboard conversion can get extremely expensive in terms of hundreds of millions of dollars of conversion, if you wish to do it and place yourself in a cost competitive position.","But again, it's not just the capital. It's the sale side on the margin to make the math work, but it's a timing issue in terms of a couple of years from inception, the amount of capital to do it properly. I think if you go back and look at what's been done up in Canada with the latest conversion, we know what they spent and, again, the time it took. And then, the biggest thing, and Tom mentioned is truly the biggest factor, where are we going to go sell the stuff. So...","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Appreciate that. And I was curious the comment you made about better usage of recycled fiber has been a little bit of a benefit. Is there much you can do on the operating side to kind of adjust? And I don't imagine there is huge benefits, but maybe switching from OCC to sort of paper or DLK or any other kinds of recycled fiber. Any more color on that comment?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","No, we're in balance right now and it's for quality and for where we need to be presenting the right kind of containerboard into our system. The amount of DLK, the amount of OCC we are using, we wouldn't consider a mixed waste.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks very much.","Mark W.

Glazerman - Roe Equity Research","Just going back to your options as you look at potential incremental board supply, understandably a lot of the focus has been on virgin, but could you envision a scenario where you might look to have some recycle capacity, just given how low your relative share is?","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","That would be a low probability in the matrix that I mentioned of our opportunities. That's in the low opportunity, low probability corner of the matrix.","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research","All right. And then, just in terms of the converting strategy moving forward, as you look to the independent share shrinking, as you said, possibly down to 5% already, obviously, the opportunity to continue a strategy of acquiring independents is going to get tougher. Is the math \u2013 can you just \u2013 how are you thinking about, given where the recent valuations have been relative to perhaps doing some organic work in the systems to the extent that you're talking about putting some money into the converting system in your CapEx plans?","Mark W.

There is no question about that. I mean, as Mark mentioned earlier, I mean, we've got additional CapEx spending going on in box plants, not only for growth purposes, but also to be more cost effective. That's something we believe that we'll probably ramp that up a little bit more. And, yeah, there is no question that the acquisition opportunities are going to be a little fewer and more selective, but that's not to say they don't exist and that's certainly not to say, we won't do them if it fits in our criteria.","Gail S.

And the range of \u2013 in terms of our targets we're evaluating capital spending, there is a range of opportunity. It depends on the amount of capital and the complexity of the project looking at the ultimate returns that it presents. And so we don't have one metric, that's the target that has to be bid on in an evaluation. So it's \u2013 a lot of factors go into the capital spending decision.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Would you say the returns are as good as they've been in the past, if you can put a number on it?","Robert P.

Your host today will be Mr. Mark Kowlzan, Chief Executive Officer of PCA. Upon conclusion of his narrative, there will be a Q&A session. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Kowlzan, and please proceed when you are ready.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Good morning, and welcome to Packaging Corporation of America's third quarter earnings release conference call. I'm Mark Kowlzan, CEO of PCA; and with me on the call today is Paul Stecko, Executive Chairman of PCA; Tom Hassfurther, who runs our Corrugated business; and Rick West, PCA's Chief Financial Officer. Thanks for participating in this morning's call, and after the presentation, we'll be glad to take any questions.","Yesterday, we reported third quarter net income of $84 million or $0.86 per share, which included an after-tax charge of $3 million or $0.03 per share for costs related to the announced Boise Inc. acquisition agreement, and a noncash after-tax charge of $2 million or $0.02 per share for pension plan changes related to the PCA hourly mill employees. We reported a similar charge in the second quarter which covered our hourly corrugated products plant employees. Excluding these charges, earnings were a record $89 million or $0.91 per share. This compares to third quarter 2012 net income, excluding special items of $53 million or $0.55 per share. Net sales were a record $845 million, up 17% from third quarter of 2012 net sales of $723 million. The $0.36 per share increase in earnings, excluding special items, was driven by higher containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix of $0.44, and higher corrugated products sales volume of $0.05. These items were partially offset by: higher costs for fiber of $0.03; labor, $0.03; incentive compensation, $0.03; energy, $0.02; transportation, $0.01; and chemicals, $0.01. Excluding special items, net income for the first 9 months of 2013 was a record $219 million or $2.25 per share compared to the net income for the first 9 months of 2012 of $142 million or $1.45 per share. Year-to-date net sales were $2.4 billion, up 14% from $2.1 billion in the first 3 quarters of 2012.","In summary, we had an outstanding quarter in all aspects of operations, with record earnings driven by higher prices for containerboard and corrugated products, higher corrugated products volume and record mill production. We beat our guidance by $0.03 per share driven by better-than-expected volume and mix.","Moving to the details of operations. Corrugated products shipments were up 7.8%, both in total and per workday, compared to last year's third quarter. We are particularly pleased with this performance because it was achieved completely on organic growth. That is, the year-over-year increase did not benefit from box plant acquisitions, since our last box plant was acquired in the first quarter of 2012. Corrugated products shipments were an all-time quarterly record on a shipments per-workday basis. Demand for both domestic and export containerboard remained strong through the quarter, but our ability to supply outside markets was limited. Because of higher containerboard consumption in our box plants, our outside containerboard shipments were down about 12,000 tons from last year's third quarter. The domestic sales were up 8,000 tons, while lower-priced export sales were down 20,000 tons. We ended the quarter with our containerboard inventories down about 4,000 tons below 2012 year-end levels. Our inventory level is rather tight considering October has 22 corrugated products shipping days compared to just 20 shipping days in September. Therefore, it's imperative that our mills continue to run well on October, which they have through the first 14 days of the month.","Moving to mill production and performance. Our mills ran extremely well, producing 671,000 tons of containerboard, setting an all-time quarterly record. Our final 2013 annual mill maintenance outage is currently underway at our Filer City, Michigan corrugated medium mill, and I'm happy to report that it's progressing very well. The plan there is for a 5-day outage that will reduce production by about 7,000 tons.","On the revenue side. Prices and mix were higher for both containerboard and corrugated products, improving earnings by $0.44 per share compared to last year's third quarter. This included, essentially, a full quarter's impact of the pass-through of our April $50 containerboard price increase to corrugated products. Wood cost were higher this quarter in the U.S. Southeast -- as the Southeast had more rain than the typical summer, making it tougher to get into some wood tracks that are normally accessible during summer months. The frequency of the wet weather, especially in July and August, resulted in wood cost increasing $0.02 per share compared to the third quarter of 2012. Recycled fiber costs were also higher than last year, decreasing earnings by about $0.01 per share as industry published prices for recycled fiber, excluding delivery costs, were up about $25 per ton compared to the third quarter of last year.","With regard to cost, energy costs were up $0.02 per share compared to last year's third quarter, driven by increased prices paid for purchased fuels. Natural gas prices increased about $1 per meter squared Btu, and coal prices were up about $0.60 per meter squared Btu compared to prices paid last year during the third quarter. In addition, labor cost increased $0.03 per share, and incentive compensation, which are prorated to earnings per share, were $0.03 per share higher than last year with our increased earnings. Transportation cost increased $0.01 per share due, in part, to rail rate increases and a mix of outbound mill shipment destinations.","I'm now going to turn it over to Rick West, our CFO, who will give you an update on our financial position.","Richard B. West","Thank you, Mark. In the third quarter, PCA generated cash from operations of $137 million. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $50 million. We paid our quarterly common stock dividend of approximately $39 million. Cash tax payments of $36 million were made, and the remaining fuel credits of $4 million were used to offset federal taxes during the quarter. We also elected to make a discretionary pension contribution of $30 million during the quarter, and at the end of September, our cash on hand was $397 million, up $27 million from the end of the second quarter.","Our total long-term debt outstanding at the end of the quarter, excluding capital leases, was $782 million. And including cash on hand, our net debt was $385 million. As of September 30, 2013, our diluted shares outstanding were 97.5 million shares.","As Mark mentioned earlier, during the third quarter, PCA recorded cost of $3 million, after tax, related to the announced Boise Inc. acquisition agreement. This charge included a $2 million charge for bridge financing fee, and $1 million for other acquisition-related costs. In addition, we recorded a $2 million after-tax charge which was related to a change in our hourly pension plan.","We recently negotiated an agreement involving our 4 containerboard mills who will transition from a defined benefit plan to a defined contribution 401(k) plan. The pension charge is based on accounting guidance which requires us to accelerate the recognition of prior service pension costs for employees affected by this change. With that, I will turn it back over to Mark.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Thank you, Rick. Before discussing the fourth quarter, I'd like to give you a brief update on the Boise acquisition. We initiated our tender offer for all Boise shares on September 26, 2013, and this offer expires at midnight on October 24, 2013. If more than 50% of the Boise shares are tendered, the minimum tender condition is met, and we will expect to close on October 25, 2013. We have bridge financing in place and expect to complete the permanent bank and bond financing for the acquisition prior to close. For a variety of reasons, including that we must operate as separate businesses until the closing, we do not plan on taking any further questions about the acquisition until after the closing.","Now moving ahead to the fourth quarter. We expect lower mill production with the planned annual outage at Filer City and increased mill operating cost. Corrugated products volume is expected to be lower, since the fourth quarter contains 2 less shipping days than the third quarter. We also expect seasonally higher fuel costs at the onset of colder weather, and higher amortization of annual outage repair cost. Considering these items, we expect fourth quarter earnings to be about $0.84 per share, excluding any impact from the Boise acquisition. This would put us at earnings per share of $3.09 for 2013, excluding special items, compared to $2.06 last year.","With that, we'll be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. The statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements.","With that, operator, I'd like to open the call for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk about how demand trended through the 3 months of the quarter, and how you're seeing it play out in October? And then also, you continue to grow faster than the industry. I'm wondering if you can give us any color in terms of what market segments or what customers maybe you're seeing the most strength with?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Yes. As we said in July, we started out the first 8 days or so up about 10%. But we trended down slightly, as we expected, but we didn't remain flat through the August, September period. So with our roll-up being very strong, we saw good, strong, consistent numbers.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And in early October?","Mark W. Kowlzan","For the first 8 days, again, that's a small sample considering the 23-day shipping month. We're up 4.4% on a shipments basis.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And is there any segment or is there any customer base where your -- you think you're growing faster than the industry? Or can you talk generally about the kind of volume -- the volume outperformance that you've seen versus what we've seen industry-wide?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Consistently throughout the year, especially through the third quarter, we saw good activity throughout North America through our 71 plant footprint. So again, just good, consistent volume growth, year-over-year, throughout the system.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And maybe one last one. I don't know if Rick mentioned this, but could you give guidance for CapEx for the full year, x Boise? I don't know if there's an updated view from last quarter?","Richard B. West","Yes, Anthony, this is Rick. In terms of CapEx, we have a lot of CapEx spent normally in the fourth quarter. And we're still on plan for the $215 million estimate for 2013. Maybe around $205 million to $215 million, but it's going to be in that range.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Connelly with CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Mark, just 2 things. I wonder if you could tell us, given how fiber stacked up the wrong way this quarter, what you're expecting relative to Q3 and Q4? And second, as you look at your inventories, it looks like you guys are running pretty successfully with lower inventories than you used to. Have you actually changed the way you're managing inventories? Because as I look at my inventory days, I see you're doing a lot better than you did a couple of years ago?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Well, on the first question on fiber. Again, with the wet weather we saw in the Southeast region, specifically back in Valdosta, the weather has subsided and gotten back to a normal pattern through September into October. So we're seeing things flatten out on the wood cost. Also, don't forget during the third quarter, typically, the Southern Mills system in particular, does go through their winter wood build. But we're seeing wood cost pretty flat right now throughout the Southern system. So again, we're not expecting any pressure.","Paul T. Stecko","And just to amplify on what Mark said, Mark, yes, we saw a bigger wood cost increase at Valdosta than, say, Counce, because Valdosta got hit more by the bad weather than Counce.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Yes, we had -- there was a 28-day period during the month of July that it rained 28 of the days during the month in the Valdosta region.","Paul T. Stecko","And with regard to inventory management, I'll just comment, yes, I think we're managing it the same. We might be a little more efficient. And as they say, necessity is the mother of invention. When you're running constantly at 100% at capacity, where we've been for the last 2, 2.5 years, you've got to really stay on top of your inventory. And so yes, maybe we're running it a little better than we have, but we haven't changed our philosophy or strategy in that regard.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","The question I had is on the whole price timing of the increase, if you can comment. On my rough numbers, it looks like your average realizations are pushing $100 above where they were a year ago, which is about what the board increase was. And -- however, we know at the box level, there can be some variations. So the question is, should we expect any more of the spring increase to bleed into the fourth quarter? Or was it fully reflected in the third quarter?","Mark W. Kowlzan","We reflected that fully in the third quarter. As we said on the second quarter call, we expected to complete that pass-through early in the quarter, and we did. And so we don't expect to see any more impact from that.","Paul T. Stecko","Yes, there may be a couple of days, Chip, but it's a miniscule, a small amount.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Got you. Okay. And then the second question is, we just got, I guess, the data for September, which seems to indicate that inventories seem to have come down a bit more than normal after the big jump in the summer. In your system, can you comment -- do you feel your inventories got -- it sounds like you don't feel they did, but did you sense, at any point, that they were above where you were comfortable? Or do you feel like they were always sort of within what your plan was?","Mark W. Kowlzan","No. Again, running at 100%, we had to anticipate the third quarter. But we're about where we want it to be. Understanding where our business was, and we are up about 6,000 tons compared to the second quarter because of the Filer planned outage, and having to supply such a big October.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay. And then, just a final question. When we look overseas, it seems like, in a very general sense -- and I know as you guys have become more integrated, you're not as active in the export markets. But it looks like you've seen some firming in places like Brazil, but you saw some sluggishness in Europe. And I didn't know if you had any late, recent color on how you see especially Europe in terms of kraft linerboard at this point?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","Chip, this is Tom. I'll just comment on that real quick. I think that, for the most part, we saw the lift in pricing throughout this year. And that's held reasonably stable. A little bit of sluggishness in Europe. But I don't see anything -- again, we're a fairly small player there, but with regard to our customers, we don't see any enormous slippage or anything like that.","Paul T. Stecko","Chip, we have more concerns about people wanting tons since we pulled them back in the export than price. So most that have been -- most of the discussions -- again, our exports business isn't real large. It's been more about the availability of tons we might add as opposed to the price.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Wilde of Deutsche Bank.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","One, can we give any thoughts, Mark, on any pressure you guys might be seeing or might be anticipating from some of these pellet plants going in the south. I know that kind of southern and eastern Georgia seem to be getting more than their fair share.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Mark, over the last 3 years, we've seen the pellet plants come online and it's put a direct pressure on the basket, and much as we expected. So much of the cost escalation that we've seen in the last few years in the southeast was the pellet plant activity, along with some of the OSB plants that are coming on. But yes, there's been an impact from the pellet plants.","Paul T. Stecko","I think the other consideration here, Mark, is -- and Mark Kowlzan is right. We've seen some pressure, but it has not resulted in large price increases for wood, obviously. Our prices remained pretty stable. But long-term, I'm more and more optimistic because a lot of these pellets, as you know, are being exported to Europe. And the only thing that makes the economics work in that deal, because you're shipping a lot of water with that fiber, is the government subsidies over there. And we've seen countries like Spain have heavy subsidies for solar energy, et cetera, determining that the economics do not do good benefits to their balance of payments, their debt, et cetera. And so I think longer-term, as the world becomes a more competitive place, people are going to start questioning whether the subsidies that government are paying to support these woodchips are really worthwhile. So long term, I think that the jury is still out on how successful pellet plants will be.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, it's a long distance to ship sort of low Btu-content fuel. The other question I had was for Tom Hassfurther, just back on the export markets briefly. Tom, just to confirm something that I think is the case. In the export markets, you guys skew more to Latin America and more to the heavyweight board, is that correct?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","That's correct.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can you give us any kind of just general guideline about what percent of your exports might be Latin America over time?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","Well, I'm not going to get into those kinds of specifics, Mark. But I'll just say that when you get to that market, echoing what Paul said earlier, our big concern is finding the tons to be able to supply the customers that we have down there and the demand that we have down there. So that market remains quite good for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question. With the demand trends you're seeing so far this month, any impact that you've noticed from the government shutdown?","Mark W. Kowlzan","No, I mean, it's hard to qualify that and quantify that. Again, with the 23-day month, and with the business up 4.4% for the first 8 days, we're pretty pleased with that. But we don't have any direct evidence of any impact to us, per se.","Paul T. Stecko","And just to amplify on that point, when you have a 23-day month, your best number -- and you want to compare it year-over-year, we had an extra day this October. Right? 1 extra day. And so that's going to add 5% to the number. And so you would expect a little lower per day shipment balanced by having 1 more day. No, I'm incorrect, it's the same number. No, I'm incorrect, it was last month. So it will be the same number of days. I stand corrected. Like Mark said, we're up 4.4%. We averaged 6%, up 7% or so last quarter. So we're a little bit behind that. What it's related to is -- October is a long month, 23 days. So we've got a very small sample size.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. Okay. I know you guys didn't want to take any questions on Boise. Rick, you had mentioned on the last call that you might have some initial thoughts on the D&A and the step-ups and those types of things. So if you had a comment there, I was just curious if you had any info?","Paul T. Stecko","No comment on Boise.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. Okay. And then with the integration ahead for you guys and with where your financial leverage is right now, to the extent other mill assets were to come for sale, would you think of yourselves as kind of being more focused on integrating the Boise acquisition and doing just kind of the box plant deals that you typically would do? Or -- and more likely nothing on the mill side or how would you think about your capacity to do more right now?","Richard B. West","That's a great question for next quarter's earnings call, and we'll be more than happy to answer it. But that's tied part and parcel to the Boise and, as Mark said, we're not going to comment on that until we're completed with it.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Fair enough. Last question, just on pension contributions, Rick, with these changes in the plants, are there any expectations that we should have about what that might mean for required contributions in the future?","Richard B. West","Long-term, less, but not aiming lower amounts in the short term.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of questions. Maybe bigger picture. First of all, you've done a tremendous job over the last few years of raising margin in the business. Now do you have a view on what the horizon could be in terms of how much more margin improvement you can have, excluding the effect of pricing and obviously, excluding the effect of Boise within your business? And how important are the box plant investments in driving that margin improvement over time? And then, I had a follow-up.","Paul T. Stecko","Yes. I'll take that, George. Margins -- depends on a couple of things. Price and costs. And obviously, if your volume increases, you get to amortize overhead, over more tons, that reduces your cost. And so that and where price goes are the 2 biggest determinants of profitability. And we got a pretty good handle on where we think where volumes run and we don't speculate, ever, on forward pricing publicly. So that's about as good as I can do there. But the fact that we've added box plant capacity in markets where we were either sold out or getting close to that, again, has enabled us to put those tons through a box plant that most of the overhead was already absorbed. That's helped our margins. So this $200 million of money we've spent on the box plants over the last 3, 4 years, has definitely contributed to our margin improvement.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Right. I was holding price counts as well in the question. So it sounds like it's not so much incremental mix you're getting from the box plant investment, it's more the operating leverage that's allowing you because you have more ability to grow the business. Where do you...?","Paul T. Stecko","It's actually both.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So -- and would you say it's split evenly or more the volume growth or more the mix effect, Paul?","Paul T. Stecko","We're not giving up the secret recipe.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. The other question I had, and I'll turn it over, where do you have the most concern about cost pressure over the next 2 to 3 years? Which line item or which factors should we be observing most closely in terms of potential erosion of the margin progress you've had over the last number of years?","Paul T. Stecko","George, regarding that question. Just general inflation. Obviously, the energy, wood cost type of impacts. But again, just general. Except for, of course, the big wildcard that everybody knows about is OCC. And if the world economy expands at a more significant rate than it has in the last year or 2, we believe that OCC is going to come under cost pressure. And again, we're advantaged in that regard because we are among the lowest users of OCC in the industry.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","As you think about your existing mill assets in the containerboard side and your ability to increase production through productivity initiatives as you look over the next 12 months, where do you think you can grow your production on the containerboard side through productivity?","Mark W. Kowlzan","We've been stating that the 1% creep is a normal creep for us based on, again, a normal CapEx spend. As we've said for many years now, it depends on how much capital you want to spend. But 1% is a good number to expect for a creep.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful, mark. And then, clearly, you're busy with the Boise acquisition, but as you think about the potential to add incremental converting capacity and box plants, can you talk about what the pipeline looks like for you on the box plant side?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Yes. we're -- we will continue to look for opportunities wherever they happen to be. And if they fit our model correctly, we'll pursue those acquisitions. Going forward, we're not going to deviate much from the plan that we've had going the past few years.","Richard B. West","Yes, we want to get to over 90% vertically integrated. And if we can get there with strictly internal growth, that would be fine. And -- but it will probably take some more box plant acquisitions to do it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Gaffner with Barclays.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So as the economy shifts more towards e-commerce, especially in the fourth quarter, is there anything that you're changing as far as your production or inventory plans in the fourth quarter to sort of accommodate that shift to more of an e-commerce market versus traditional brick-and-mortar?","Mark W. Kowlzan","No. Again, no plans on changing anything. Just over the last 5 or 6 years, we've just definitely seen the benefit of the e-commerce during the holiday season.","Paul T. Stecko","December used to be -- used to be the tough month or a half-decent month. Decembers have been pretty constant over the last 5 years. The only thing we do, do -- and it's nothing new, we try to build a little inventory in the fourth quarter to support our mill outages which are stacked into the first quarter. But that's not a change, we've done that for the last 15 years.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And -- I mean, there were a couple of articles on the Wall Street Journal about Walmart trying to buy more American goods. And I think part of your thesis on it, the North American containerboard market has always been on-shoring of U.S. manufacturing. Anything you can share on those 2 fronts? Anything you're seeing that maybe we're not seeing as far as return the manufacturing to North America?","Paul T. Stecko","This is Paul again. I'll comment on that. Yes, I read the same things you read and so I don't think we're seeing a lot more than you might be seeing in terms of a macro look at this on-shoring phenomena as it unfolds. I will tell you though, from my perspective, if I went back -- I've got to go back 10 years now, that Tom Hassfurther would be running in about every 3 days telling me that this customer moved to China. And this customer moved his business to Mexico. I can't remember the last time he came in and told me somebody moved to China, and it's very infrequently that he tells me somebody moved to Mexico. So there's still a little movement to Mexico but not much. And Tom, you want to comment on that a little further? Because I think it's an important point that the trend has definitely stopped. The question is, how strong will it reverse itself? So I'll let you, since are talking to 70 box plants, amplify on that.","Thomas A. Hassfurther","Okay, Paul. I'd just like to add that, what Paul said is actually correct. The exodus from the country has essentially stopped. We don't see that much at all anymore. And I think that Walmart's initiative that they just announced buy -- to purchase more from American companies, I think coincides with the fact that a lot of American companies have become much more competitive worldwide. And with the labor rates going up in places like China dramatically, it's become more difficult to do business there, the costs have gone up, et cetera, that's driving Walmart's initiative. I think it's altruistic to say I'm going to buy from America, and that's a good thing to do but also, they're only going to do it if it's really competitive. And so I think that's a very good indicator that Walmart sees American manufacturing becoming much more competitive.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Ng with Jefferies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just wanted to get a read on demand trend. I know you said the first few days of October was up 4% or so. Seems like a modest deceleration from Q2 trends. I just don't want to read too much into it. I just wanted to get a pulse on what you're seeing from the demand side and what your customers are saying?","Mark W. Kowlzan","I would say, Phil, that our demand has remained fairly steady. It's hard to read in much to this number that we have so far in October just because October is a 23-day month. And we don't have a very good sampling for just 8 days. It's hard to indicate what's going to go on. And we came out of a very strong Q2 and a very strong September as well.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. So it just sounds like business as usual. And in terms of your fiber cost, you talked about how wood cost ticked up. From a weather standpoint, things have subsided a little bit. And I think you mentioned that you expect wood prices to flatten out. Is there any room for it to come -- fall down, decline x the seasonality component just because it does seem like the headwind that you saw in 3Q is subsiding a bit here?","Mark W. Kowlzan","It's really sensitive to weather patterns. And again, if we ended up with a warm, dry winter period, you'd see a lot less pressure, and basically, a falling off on pricing. If we end up with a cold, wet weather, then, it's a different story. So again, it's pretty much just weather-dependent.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Got you. And just one last, bigger-picture question. You guys were pretty much running flat-out for the last few years and your box shipments has obviously outpaced the broader market. Has that limited your ability to grow on the box side? It certainly doesn't seem like it, but with the potential incremental capacity you're getting from Boise, would that allow you to sustain that growth profile or potentially accelerate it going forward?","Mark W. Kowlzan","As we've said for the last year or 2, in order to support the domestic growth, we're going to rationalize any of the lower-value export tons, and we've done just that. And so as time has gone on, we've supplied the North American footprint growth with the tons that came out of the exports.","Operator","Our next question comes from Al Kabili with Macquarie.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Just a question on the growth. Can you just kind of help us parse out the type of growth you're seeing in these sort of larger national accounts versus more of the -- your traditional strength in the smaller regional producers?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","Al, this is Tom. We don't get into lots of detail about individual segments or anything like that. I'll just say that our growth has been consistent, spread out over thousands of customers, and of course, we do business with large customers, as well as a very small ones. And it's all about the value we deliver to those customers, and that's what helps drive our demand.","Richard B. West","Basically, we consider that marketing data which is company confidential. And we don't share it with you because then we'll have to share it with competitors, and we don't do that.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Okay. All right, I appreciate that. I guess, second question is just on mix. Is there -- certainly, the dynamic of less exports helps. Is there anything else on mix that's improving or is it just really that dynamic?","Mark W. Kowlzan","I think it's more just that dynamic, Al.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then just a housekeeping question for Rick. Amortization expense going up sequentially on maintenance outages. Can you just help us what that sequential headwind, if you will, is?","Richard B. West","About $0.02 a share from 3Q to 4Q [ph].","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","$0.02 a share. Okay, got it.","Mark W. Kowlzan","When he says $0.02 a share, that's the increase. Not the total. So it's gone from roughly $0.04 to $0.06.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo Securities.","Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Gabe Hajde sitting in for Chris. Question about utilization across your downstream box plant assets. Can you talk about maybe regionally or maybe end markets where you guys are particularly tight and could see investment dollars over the next 12, 24 months?","Mark W. Kowlzan","No, we can't comment on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carly Mattson with Goldman Sachs.","Carly Mattson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Could you talk to any update on the anticipated timing for the public debt financing portion of the acquisition, given the shelf that was filed this morning?","Mark W. Kowlzan","We have no comment at this time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Kind of a follow-on question, I think, mainly for Tom Hassfurther. If we look at the industry box shipments, year-to-date, they're essentially flat. The economy is up a bit. So it just kind of raises the question, Tom, of what you're seeing in terms of puts-and-takes, in terms of where the industry might actually be losing volume. Is there some demand destruction which might have taken place? If we walk through a big box store like a Costco, you see a lot more use of shrink wraps, it seems like, these days. At the same time, we know that e-commerce is using more boxes. So can you just help us kind of reconcile, kind of, those puts-and-takes in terms of box demand, and why you think the industry, as a whole, is flat this year when there's some growth in the economy?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","Well, Mark, you got a lot of different topics you're talking about there. I think you pretty much rationalized the puts-and-takes, quite frankly. You've got industries moving in lots of different directions. If they can do stretch wrap and flip sheets, that's what they'll do, as opposed to a corrugated box. At the same time, you've got the whole e-commerce side of the business, which is significantly different. And I think you've got small companies that are really upstarts. And their demand is in boxes, start to stock boxes and then moves on to regular containers. I think that you'll got the ag business that, in some cases, is doing more bulk than they did before, which can reduce some demand. But on the other hand, you've got organic growers that use more. So it kind of just goes back and forth, and you can go in all of these various markets and come up with scenarios of pluses and minuses. But at the end of the day, it is what it is and we've got the market we've got. And I think that at times, the FBA numbers have tracked GDP but have gotten away from that for quite some time. And it's a -- and I think at any given point in time, you can probably find the pluses and minuses to rationalize those numbers, but it's very complex.","Mark W. Kowlzan","And I think the more important point is that I think the biggest plus that the industry would need for the next decade is what we just talked about with the previous caller, more on-shoring of business -- and where -- the use of box in this country as opposed to coming from another country. Again, and long-term, we're fully -- we're pretty optimistic that that's going to occur over the next decade for a lot of reasons. One of which is the national debt is best fixed by economic growth. And I think that's an imperative for this country.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two quick ones. First of all, Paul, Mark, when you look at the energy projects now, I guess, 2 years from when they came online, what are your observations? What have been the learnings from this versus your initial expectations, set you up better for the next number of years? And then shorter term, as we're sort of penciling out production for the fourth quarter, would it be somewhere around 650,000 tons, in that ballpark, when we think about the shipping days and the outages at Filer City?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","George, as far as the energy projects go, again, they're delivering extremely well, both in Counce and Valdosta, and performing as designed. So we're extremely pleased with the results. As far as what we expect for tons, we expect that Filer is going to impact 7,000 tons. And if you look at the third quarter, we're somewhere down at 660,000-ton area.","Mark W. Kowlzan","And that number could move 20,000 tons either way easily depending on how we run. So we don't normally give a production forecast for the next quarter, and we're not going to start.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Have you any comment or have you seen any impact in your doings with the converted capacity we've been reading about? My understanding is that some of these mills don't even call their output containerboard, they call it packaging grades. But I just thought, if you got any broad comment about either the conversions or maybe even the company that recently announced the Midwest Mill, and how they fit sort of in the marketplace, and as a competitor to you?","Paul T. Stecko","Let me take that one, Chip. We're not going to call out any particular companies. But I don't think it's any secret that some of the conversion tons are not the best quality, but some are good. And other than that, we would just say that the variety, in terms of quality, is greater with some of this new stuff than you would get with the existing capacity at a good integrated mill. And then, as the OCC supply gets pressured, as you know, that can have a deleterious effect on quality because some -- most of the conversions that have been talked about are 100% recycled. And -- but other -- further than that, we're not going to comment any further than that.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Mark W. Kowlzan","Seeing that there are no more questions, I want to thank everybody for joining us today, and look forward to seeing you on the annual call in January.

Your host today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chief Executive Officer of PCA. Upon the conclusion of his narrative there will be a Q&A session. I will now turn the conference call over to Mr. Kowlzan and please proceed when you\u2019re ready.","Mark Kowlzan","Good morning. I\u2019m Mark Kowlzan, CEO of PCA, and with me on the call today is Paul Stecko, our Chairman; Tom Hassfurther, who runs our Packaging business; Judy Lassa who runs our White papers business; and Rick West, our CFO. Thanks for participating in this morning\u2019s call and after the presentation we\u2019ll be glad to take any questions.","Yesterday we reported Q4 record net income of $227 million or $2.33 per share. Earnings included special items of $1.07 per share of income from the reversal of tax reserves for both PCA and Boise related to alternative energy tax credits and after-tax costs totaling $0.41 per share relating primarily to PCA\u2019s acquisition of Boise, Inc. on October 25, 2013.","Excluding special items, net income was $101 million or $1.04 per share compared to Q4 2012 net income excluding special items of $59 million or $0.61 per share. Net sales were a record $1.3 billion compared to $737 million last year. ","The $0.43 per share increase in earnings was driven by improvements in PCA\u2019s earnings of $0.23 per share compared to last year\u2019s Q4 and a partial quarter result from the acquisition of Boise of $0.20 per share. The PCA earnings increase of $0.23 per share resulted from an improved pricing mix of $0.36 and volume, $0.04, which was partially offset by cost increases in repairs of $0.03; fiber, $0.03; labor, $0.03; energy, $0.02; depreciation, $0.02; chemicals, $0.01; and other items, $0.03.","I should also point out that the $0.20 per share contributed by Boise includes a $0.06 per share deduction for all interest expense incurred during the quarter from the additional debt that resulted from acquiring Boise.","Whole year earnings excluding special items were $320 million or $3.28 per share compared to 2012 earnings excluding special items of $201 million or $2.06 per share. Net sales were a record $3.7 billion compared to $2.8 billion in 2012. Full year earnings including special items were $436 million or $4.47 per share compared to 2012 earnings of $164 million or $1.68 per share. Detailed special items for both Q4 and the full year were included in the schedules that accompanied our earnings press release.","We finished 2013 with another outstanding quarter, setting all-time records for sales, earnings and shipments. Our demand was steady throughout the quarter for both packaging and white papers and December volume was particularly strong. ","We are pleased with Boise\u2019s results which included only two months and five days of operations. Boise\u2019s earnings per share results benefited from early synergy realizations and also by the successful integration of PCA and Boise, which we\u2019ll talk about in more detail later in the presentation. For the year our earnings were up 60% over 2012\u2019s record earnings and strong cash flow has allowed us to pay down $150 million in debt since we acquired Boise on October 25.","Looking at more details in our packaging business, PCA Corrugated Products shipments were up 4.4% in total and per work day over last year\u2019s Q4. Shipments were strong throughout the quarter, up each month on a per workday basis, and again, it\u2019s a very tough comp with PCA\u2019s Q4 2012 shipments up almost 6% over 2011. Including Boise\u2019s shipments from October 25th through year-end, total PCA shipments were up 24%.","For the year, PCA\u2019s total shipments were up 5.7% and up 6.1% per workday compared to 2012, all of which came from organic growth. Including Boise\u2019s partial Q4 shipments, total 2013 shipments were up 10.7% and per workday up 11.1%.","Both domestic containerboard and [export] sales demand remained strong in Q4 except for South America where the impact of cold weather on produce crops has lowered demand. Our containerboard mills produced 803,000 tons in Q4 including 141,000 tons of production by the former Boise mills. We completed an annual outage at our Filer City, Michigan, medium mill in October which resulted in production losses of about 6,700 tons. ","For the year, total containerboard production was 2,749,000 tons. PCA\u2019s total containerboard inventories at year-end, which for comparison purposes includes PCA and Boise tons at year-end 2013 and year-end 2012, were down 1,000 tons. The ending inventory is a little lower than we had targeted considering there were two less mill production days in Q1 compared to Q4 and our Counce, Tennessee, linerboard mill will be down for a week in March for its annual outage.","Pricing for domestic containerboard and boxes remained very steady during the quarter, but we did see some limited price reductions in export containerboard particularly in Latin America with the weather-related demand issues.","Looking at white papers, our volume was up about 1% compared to last year\u2019s Q4 driven by growth in office papers which more than offset declines in printing and converting and pressure sensitive papers. The grades that declined in volume were significantly impacted by the permanent closures of two machines and lost machine [color] at the International Falls mill in October. The closures reduced capacity by about 115,000 tons annually. These closures, however, brought the mill into pulp balance and eliminated the need for purchased pulp, which should improve profitability in 2014.","White papers\u2019 income was disproportionately affected in the partial quarter of PCA\u2019s ownership by the annual shutdown of the Jackson, Alabama, mill which occurred in November. This shutdown reduced production by about 10,000 tons and increased operating costs. We ended the year with our white papers\u2019 inventory down about 14,000 tons compared to last year and 11,000 tons below Q3.","In Q4 we notified customers and began implementing price increases of $60 per ton for office papers and printing and converting grades. In February we notified customers of an additional price increase of $70 for printing and converting grades, $50 for branded business papers, and $70 for private label. The price increases are effective March 3, 2014.","Finally, we continue to make improvements in day-to-day mill operations and are finding additional opportunities for synergies in the process. I\u2019m now going to turn it over to Rick West, our CFO, who will provide more financial details.","Rick West","Thank you, Mark. In Q4 cash generated from operations was $188 million and for the year was [$608 million]. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $104 million and for the year were $234 million. Common stock dividends of $39 million were paid or $0.40 per share, and for the year, dividends of $109 million were paid. We did not repurchase any shares of PCA common stock during Q4 and for the year share repurchases totaled $8 million. [Cash tax] segments were $45 million in Q4 and for the year were $91 million. ","We ended the year with $191 million in cash. We paid off $109 million of debt in December and an additional $41 million in January, making our total debt reduction since the acquisition $150 million. With the debt pay down our long-term debt is now at $2.509 billion. I am happy to report that the IRS audit of PCA\u2019s 2008 and 2009 tax returns were completed during Q4 and all claimed alternative energy tax credits were allowed. As a result, we were able to reverse the tax reserve recorded for the Filer City biofuel tax credit of $104 million which we have fully used to offset past taxes owed.","In addition, as a result of an IRS Chief Counsel Memorandum published in Q4 we were also able to release a Boise tax reserve of $62 million related to the taxability of the alternative fuel mixture credits. ","As we normally do at the beginning of each year, PCA provides estimates for certain 2014 items. We expect total capital expenditures to be between $380 million to $400 million including normal capital, required capital for synergies, [Foiler Mac] and the DeRidder Conversion project.","DD&A is expected to be about $340 million. Pension expense and funding is expected to be about $25 million and $5 million respectively. The combined federal and state effective tax rate is expected to be about 36.5% with a cash tax rate at about 31.0%. Based on our current long-term debt with no additional debt pay downs and current LIBOR rates our interest expense in 2014 is expected to be about $87 million, and cash interest payments are expected to be about $80 million. That\u2019s about $10 million [along with] combined interest expense for Boise and PCA prior to the acquisition.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Paul Stecko who will comment on synergies in our Boise integration efforts.","Paul Stecko","Thank you, Rick. This integration has obviously been our number one priority for the last four months. Our plan was to have our top three executives lead the specific aspects of the integration in what I term a very hands-on day-to-day fashion. Mark Kowlzan led the mill integration; Tom Hassfurther led the integration of all packaging operations, and Rick West led the integration of financial shared services and IT operations. ","We also had very strong support from Boise personnel in this endeavor, particularly Judy Lassa who is now Senior Vice President of White Papers, Virginia Aulin who\u2019s now Vice President of Human Resources for PCA, and Bernadette Madarieta who\u2019s now our VP and Controller. This team\u2019s off to a great start and I want to emphasize that a tremendous amount of work has been accomplished.","When we announced the agreement to acquire Boise on September 16, we estimated synergies of $105 million which would be achieved over three years, or about $35 million per year. Our synergy estimate is now $175 million and we think we can get to a run rate of $75 million to $80 million by the end of the first year. Actions taken immediately after the acquisition on October 25th and essentially completed by the end of the year were the elimination of about $25 million in overhead costs primarily from reduced headcount and lower corporate governance costs. ","Although not counted in our synergy estimates with the acquisition of Boise we also inherited tax-loss carry forwards of $135 million which we can utilize. These loss carry forwards are front-end loaded and already reduced our 2013 tax payments by $9 million and will reduce 2014 tax payments by $38 million. The remaining tax loss carry forwards will reduce payments by about $6 million per year from 2015 through 2028.","Finally, a few comments on the DeRidder paper machine conversion project. After the closing of the acquisition on October 25th we announced that we were putting the project on hold until we could perform a complete technical review. This was expected to delay the startup of the project from mid-2014 till Q4 2014. This is still the case. In addition to ensuring technical accuracy we also wanted to fully utilize our expertise and make any changes to the project that could further improve its returns. That process is continuing and we have found ways to improve the returns. We expect to be in a position to provide an update on the cost of the project and the expected returns sometime in March.","With that I\u2019ll turn it back to Mark for the Q1 outlook.","Mark Kowlzan","Thanks, Paul. Earnings improvement is expected from a full quarter\u2019s operation of Boise including synergies and lower amortization of annual mill outage costs. White papers\u2019 prices are expected to improve in Q1 as a result of our announced price increases. Our largest containerboard mill in Counce, Tennessee, will be down in March for its annual maintenance outage which will reduce production and increase operating costs.","We normally have increased costs from colder weather of about $0.06 per share compared to Q4 for such things as wood, energy, and transportation. So far this year however the extreme cold temperatures and significant snowfalls across the country have impacted all of our mills with higher-than-normal cost increases for these items.","Costs at our conversion plants are also being impacted and we\u2019ve had some plant closures. It\u2019s very tough to predict how these extreme weather patterns will impact PCA for the entire quarter but it\u2019s probably cost us $0.03 per share already with about a month and a half left to go in the quarter.","Labor costs are expected to be higher with beginning of the year wage increases for both salary and hourly employees and certain benefit costs will be higher, primarily FICA during Q1. We also expect a higher tax rate. Considering all these items we currently expect Q1 earnings to be from about $1.00 to $1.05 per share excluding special items. ","With that we\u2019d be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we\u2019ve made on this call constituted forward-looking statements. These statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and do involve inherent risks and uncertainties including the (inaudible) in the economy and those identified as \u201crisk factors\u201d in our annual report on file on Form 10(k) with the SEC. The actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.","And with that, Operator, I\u2019d like to open the call for questions. First question, please.","","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator instructions.) Your first question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. ","Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Yes, good morning. My questions, the first one is on the synergy target which you just raised and is impressive to see certainly. Can you give us an idea of where you found the increments of what you thought at the beginning, and were some of those increments maybe in ways the white papers business is run as part of PKG?","Mark Kowlzan","As a matter of fact the biggest area was in the white papers. We didn\u2019t have much in it initially and as we started to operate the business we discovered a lot of opportunities. And on the brown side we have the big things such as [braid] optimization and transportation opportunities along with sales mix, but as we got into the actual operations of the mills and the box plants again a lot of smaller items made themselves available to us.","Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Okay, and then just one quick follow-up. You all mentioned that the Jackson outage impacted white papers in Q4, and of course the $15 million in the paper segment was certainly more than we were looking for to begin with, not even being aware of that or building that in consciously. How much of an impact was that and should we sort of add back that number and then make our own judgment on pricing as we look at 2014 per quarter?","Mark Kowlzan","Yeah, I\u2019m going to let Judy comment on that.","Judy Lassa","Yeah, that\u2019s about a $4.5 million impact here on EBITDA in Q4.","Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Okay. But I would imagine you would have other outages you take in your system so I mean is that sort of a normal per quarter amount or was that an outsized amount?","","Judy Lassa","No, it was pretty close to a normal amount with a little bit longer run than our other outages.","Paul Stecko","Hey Chip, this is Paul. I think the point that we were trying to make is we only had the business for two months and so we had an annual shutdown in the two-month period, and usually Boise would have a shutdown once every three months. This was once every two months so it was disproportionate because of the stub period only that we owned it. They did not have a full quarter to absorb that hit \u2013 it was over a much shorter period.","Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Gotcha, very clear. And the last quick one, can you talk a little bit about your box demand experience so far this year, maybe in January?","Mark Kowlzan","Yeah, if you look at January, this is both combined PCA and Boise, we were up 2.5%. And again, considering where we were from the tough comps a year ago we were looking at a combined Boise\/PCA 11% last year in January over the prior year. So our 2.5% performance in January, we felt good and again it was up against a tremendous prior year number.","Paul Stecko","And the weather hurt us a little bit on demand. That\u2019s hard to quantify and hopefully we\u2019ll make that up over the rest of the quarter if this weather ever improves.","Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup.","Anthony Pettinari \u2013 Citigroup ","On the corrugated side, when I back out the volume growth from legacy PCA it seems like Boise\u2019s box shipments may have declined year-over-year. Am I reading that right and can you just talk a little bit about the volume performance of the Boise business?","Tom Hassfurther","Yeah, Anthony, this is Tom. All I can tell you is we really only have the information for the sub period which was very flattish over the previous year, so that\u2019s really all I can comment on in terms of the comparison.","Anthony Pettinari \u2013 Citigroup ","Okay. ","Tom Hassfurther","We would comment in January where we did have a full month of each box that Boise was up about the same amount that we were in January of this year. So that\u2019s our best current comparison.","Anthony Pettinari \u2013 Citigroup ","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then regarding the weather you referenced impacts to box plants. I\u2019m wondering with Valdosta has there been any impact to mill production from the very severe weather in the south?","","Mark Kowlzan","We\u2019ve been fortunate that we haven\u2019t had any direct impact on the productivity per se but we\u2019ve obviously had the impact on raw material goods transportation issues along with finished goods transportation issues because of the icy roads and the rail problems. And nationwide, if you go all the way from the I Falls, the Canadian border down to the Gulf coast we\u2019ve seen massive railroad problems with the extreme cold, snow and ice. So in that regard the mills have been productive but again the cost impacts are there.","Paul Stecko","I would add to that just what Mark said \u2013 we\u2019ve been a little bit lucky, too. One of the problems is the rails in this long, cold weather, they are having maintenance problems and the rail system has slowed noticeably. And in January we had at several of our mills less than a day\u2019s worth of chemicals, and if we did not get a rail ship in time we would have had to shut those mills down. And we were fortunate, we did get some just in time, switching the rail cars and we were able to keep our mills running. And knock on wood, we\u2019ve got another month and a half to go to get through this but transportation is as big an issue in and out of mills as your other costs.","Anthony Pettinari \u2013 Citigroup ","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over.","Operator","Your next question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, hi everyone, good morning. Congratulations on the year. Two quick questions actually on papers: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the size of the synergy increment, the question being previous to Boise you didn\u2019t have a white papers business. Now you do and so it\u2019s interesting that you had so much incremental synergy gain in a business where there was no direct overlap with your existing business. I was hoping you could provide a bit more color on that, and then more broadly having owned the business now for a few months and it seems to be performing well certainly relative to your expectations could you advise the community here how you see the papers business fitting in ultimately to your strategy, guys? Thank you.","Paul Stecko","Yeah, let me take that one, George. With regard to the synergies, we do have a lot of synergies \u2013 and the synergies is in operating expertise. We weren\u2019t in the white paper business but we operate mills, and there are a lot of practices, preventative maintenance being one of them that we think we\u2019re pretty good at and we\u2019ve applied those principles in the white paper business.","Now that said we actually did a poor job upfront estimating the white paper synergies because we\u2019re primarily a packaging company and we focused on those synergies. But again, as we got into the white paper business a lot of synergies came out of it, and I would say that about half the increment \u2013 and that\u2019s just an estimate at this point \u2013 came from additions to white papers; the other half came from things we found in the brown.","With regard to your second question, what we think about the white paper business, I\u2019ll say again we\u2019re primarily a packaging company. But when it comes to white papers we see some excellent opportunities to create shareholder value, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re here to do \u2013 create shareholder value. And the first way we can do it is by obviously improving operations in white papers and we\u2019ve already stated to do that; and then we got a little bit of help in that market conditions as you know have improved significantly since we made this acquisition for white papers.","And third, we feel we have the ability to build on a very, very strong competency that this business has and that is excellence in logistics and customer service. So overall I would tell you that compared to the time of the acquisition we\u2019re very encouraged and we feel we have a real opportunity to create significant shareholder value in this part of the business. Although it\u2019s not nearly as big as packaging it\u2019s going to add a lot of value to the enterprise.","George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you, Paul, I\u2019ll turn it over.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you, good morning. On the white papers business, the second largest player seems to be walking away from some business. As you think about your volumes for white papers in 2014 do you expect to benefit from any incremental business going your way that the competitor\u2019s walking away from?","Mark Kowlzan","Judy?","Judy Lassa","I don\u2019t have a comment on that.","Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. And on the packaging side can you let us know what the mix between domestic and export is including Boise and where the integration level is as well for the box plants including the Boise assets right now?","Paul Stecko","Let me handle part of that and we\u2019ll let Tom take some of that. Regarding the integration level we\u2019re currently looking at about 90% integrated. If you think about what we said over the last four years we expected to be at 90% plus by the end of 2014. We are there so everything we\u2019ve been talking about regarding the importance of DeRidder and the ability to supply tons is still very true.","Regarding the export and the balance of domestic and export, I\u2019ll let Tom get into that.","Tom Hassfurther","Alex, I\u2019d just say that on the balance between domestic and export with the combined company, it\u2019s still virtually the same. We\u2019ve reduced our export footprint as we talked about in previous quarterly calls during the year and Boise has pretty much maintained theirs. But going forward we\u2019ll still be very much what I call a small, specialty strategic player in the exports market.","Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And then just one last quick one from me: the increased synergy target, I think looking at the D&A number today it\u2019s a little bit lower than what I think you\u2019ve previously talked about. Is any of these increased synergies due to lower D&A or is it all higher cash synergies that you\u2019re seeing?","Rick West","No, the synergies did not have any impact on DD&A. In fact, the synergies to DD&A came in about what we expected. And one thing I\u2019ll point out, when you look at the step up in value of the fixed assets and the overall assets it\u2019s probably not as great as you would expect because the Boise assets were revalued in 2008. So in total I would say that the total step up in DD&A only impacted depreciation expense year-over-year from 2013 is if we\u2019d acquired Boise on January 1st through the entire year to 2014. DD&A only went up about 15 with DD&A going down in the paper business some and up in the packaging business.","Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great help everyone, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.","Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research ","Thank you. Two questions: one on the segmentation, are you including basically the same things in the paper segment that Boise had or have you made some adjustments? ","Rick West","The only adjustment we\u2019ve made in the reporting of the paper segment, we now report the W2 machine at Wallula which makes corrugating media within the packaging segment whereas Boise kept the media machine in the paper segment and we felt that was a better representation of both businesses to move it into the packaging.","","Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research ","Okay, thank you. And then second, so Boise was roughly $0.20 accretive in the just over two months that you had it. Is it fair to think of the acquisition that if you\u2019d had it for the whole time it would have been closer to $0.30? And if you times that by four it would have been close to $1.20? And then hopefully you\u2019ve even got good things going on with price and some other things and [encoded] for instance so that again, we\u2019ll see how things play out but potentially you can get even more accretion \u2013 throw synergies on top of that as well \u2013 which assuming that there\u2019s some validity to that process of thinking how do you think about the dividend which really was established before you had Boise and now we\u2019ve got all this additional earnings and cash flow? Is it appropriate to think about sooner rather than later repositioning some of that cash flow into raising the dividend again?","Paul Stecko","Mark, this is Paul. I would say as a general answer it\u2019s yes to about everything you said. But let me clarify that now with regard to the dividend. What we said initially, our number one objective with regard to proceeding was to pay down debt. And our goal was, and we said it at the time of the acquisition, was to pay down $1 billion worth of debt over say the next three years. And that was based on what we thought we could do. ","Now admittedly we underestimated the synergies and we\u2019ve also got this tax benefit on a tax loss carry forward. So I think there\u2019s a possibility that we can be in the position to do both because the one negative of your stock price going up, and there\u2019s only one, is that the yield on your dividend goes down. And so we may be in the position to be able to meet both goals and then both goals would be to pay down that $1 billion in debt and with the excess cash do something to continue to improve the yield on our dividend as we go forward. And so I think there\u2019s more of a possibility of doing what you said than less of a possibility.","Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research ","Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with Credit Agricole Securities.","Mark Connelly \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities","Thanks. Mark, as we think about the synergy optimization it sounds like you\u2019re already talking about re-optimizing the mills in the existing expanded synergy targets. Should we think about this as a two-step process then where you\u2019re going to re-optimize the mills and then you\u2019re going to figure out what D2 is going to make and then probably re-optimize again after that? And the second question, do you expect your overall fiber mix to change very much? I mean some of the past repositioning of mills that Boise has done have made some pretty major changes in fiber over time. I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s a piece of your strategy here?","Mark Kowlzan","Regarding the first part of your question on optimization, the way we\u2019ve been approaching Boise is just what we\u2019ve done at PCA over the years. We\u2019ve got a very strong technical organization that is dispatched to the mills on a weekly basis, and so we basically just incorporated the Boise mills into that routine. So we have multiple activities taking place at all of the mills and so there\u2019s a parallel path forward on how we\u2019re optimizing, and that\u2019s also including the DeRidder piece of the equation. So everything\u2019s happening in a parallel fashion so we\u2019re not doing anything in a linear fashion by any means. And then regarding fiber I don\u2019t expect to see anything change in that regard.","Paul Stecko","And I would add again, back on your first question, we don\u2019t view this as a two-step process. We have a big picture that says \u201cThese are the capabilities we have, these\u2019ll be the capabilities after the DeRidder conversion is online; this is our supply, this is the demand.\u201d As Mark said earlier, our integration level got to our goal of 90% and that\u2019s the main driver for doing the DeRidder conversion. We need a bigger runway for the next five years. We are growing; we need tons from somewhere and the DeRidder conversion is where we\u2019ll get them or our integration level will get too high and we don\u2019t want that to happen because it impedes your ability to serve customers.","But no, we know what we\u2019re going to do. We know what we\u2019re going to make. We\u2019re just figuring out again on a project what\u2019s the optimum way to do that, to construct that to make sure we get the highest return. But it\u2019s a one-step plan, albeit that the last step in the process is the conversion project.","Mark Connelly \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities","Alright, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies and Company.","Philip Ng \u2013 Jefferies ","Good morning, guys. From what I understand you guys are probably the only national containerboard producer on the West Coast. Has that opened the door for you guys to leverage your existing relationships to win some new business from the independents?","Mark Kowlzan","When you say we\u2019re the only national producer on the West Coast, that\u2019s not-","Philip Ng \u2013 Jefferies ","Yeah, that has a footprint out there on the West Coast.","Mark Kowlzan","We don\u2019t have a [milk] footprint on the West Coast.","Tom Hassfurther","Obviously the media machine at Wallula and the DeRidder machine puts us much closer to the West Coast from a transportation point of view, so we get help there and that\u2019s our transportation synergy.","Paul Stecko","But all the big players have box plant capacity on the West Coast.","Philip Ng \u2013 Jefferies ","Okay, that\u2019s helpful.","Paul Stecko","We didn\u2019t have capacity in the Pacific Northwest so we joined\u2026 We can now say we are on the West Coast. Others could have said that before us.","Philip Ng \u2013 Jefferies ","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then based on some of the moves you guys are making in terms of pushing out D2 and some of the synergies you\u2019re looking to unlock can you provide some clarity on how we should be thinking about CAPEX for 2015 and 2016?","Rick West","Not at this point.","Mark Kowlzan","Yeah, we stated earlier that our target for the year is around $400 million and so that\u2019s what our plan is calling for for this year. We haven\u2019t really taken a look out into \u201915-\u201816.","Philip Ng \u2013 Jefferies ","Okay, and then one last housekeeping question. Can you give us some color on the tons you guys are looking to take in terms of a maintenance standpoint for the full year? I know there\u2019s some comparison differences \u2013 last time you guys took a lot more in Q2 than in Q1, so I just wanted some more color on that front.","Mark Kowlzan","You know, we generally don\u2019t comment on forward quarters regarding tons, but just obviously we have Counce down for its annual this quarter and then at least to help you understand Q2 without getting into tons we\u2019ll have the I Falls and the Wallula mills down primarily and Tomahawk for Q2. But I don\u2019t want to get into going forward tons impacts. We\u2019ll do that quarter-by-quarter when we talk about the quarter.","Philip Ng \u2013 Jefferies ","But Q1 should be a heavier quarter, is that correct?","Mark Kowlzan","No. Counce is down for its annual at the end of the March period so it\u2019s just one week.","Paul Stecko","Historically Q1 was our heaviest downtime quarter. That will not be the case this year because one, we have more mills; and two, because of equipment deliveries for example even Counce is pushed out until the end of Q1. So it will not be our normal pattern; it\u2019ll be more uniform this year than skewed towards Q1.","Philip Ng \u2013 Jefferies ","Alright, thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.","Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Yeah, good morning. I wonder if it\u2019s possible within that CAPEX number of about $400 million for this year, is it possible to get a sense of how much of that is the D2 project?","Mark Kowlzan","No, we don\u2019t want to get into that right now. Again, as Paul mentioned we\u2019ll be discussing probably that during the month of March more in detail.","Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, away from that, Mark, is it possible to get a sense of sort of what the CAPEX looks like at the other Boise mills and what that looks like relative to depreciation at the Boise mills?","Mark Kowlzan","No, we\u2019re not prepared to do that on this call, Mark. It\u2019s primarily an earnings review and we\u2019re not, we don\u2019t really want to get into that today.","Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, the one other question I had then going back to kind of Mark Weintraub\u2019s question about debt reduction and potentially a higher dividend, is it fair to say that the targets that you set initially with that three-year debt reduction goal of $1 billion, that that wouldn\u2019t have assumed all the news we\u2019ve had on pricing on [uncored free sheet] over the last three months?","Mark Kowlzan","That would be fair to assume.","Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Alright, fair enough. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Al Kabili with Macquarie.","Al Kabili \u2013 Macquarie ","Thanks. I just wanted to follow up on some of the CAPEX questions. I believe you mentioned when you provided the initial synergy outlook of $75 million to $100 million to achieve the $105 million or so of synergies, with the increase in the synergies that you now expect can you just update us on what you think the synergy-related CAPEX will be in total?","Paul Stecko","I think we may have misstated; I\u2019m not sure exactly what we said. We said that the cost of getting the synergies would be from $80 million to $100 million, so you got the $80 million to $100 million part right. But those costs were not all capital. They also included such things as severance costs for the headcount reduction. So that number\u2019s an all-in. Some of it\u2019s capital; some of it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s a one-time expense.","As we sit now that number is below $80 million as we\u2019ve had a chance to refine it, so probably in the $70 million to $80 million range is our best guess today, down from $80 million to $100 million.","Al Kabili \u2013 Macquarie ","Okay, very good. And that\u2019s with the increased synergies as well I take it.","Paul Stecko","Yes, it\u2019s with the increased synergies as well.","Al Kabili \u2013 Macquarie ","Okay, terrific. Then on a related topic on the synergies, can you help us with how much, and maybe I missed this but how much synergies you realized in Q4 and what the run rate today is on the synergies?","Rick West","I would say that we said, I\u2019m not going to get into the specific EPS amount, Al, but if you look at it what we said on the call was immediately after October 25th and through the end of the year we had got about $25 million in corporate overhead costs. So I\u2019ll let you do the math on that because it\u2019s kind of difficult if you\u2019re coming in through to the corporate, and that\u2019s an annual number \u2013 taking out $25 million in annual costs of corporate overhead. And then Paul mentioned that we would be at an annual rate of about $75 million to $80 million by the end of the year, so that\u2019s about as much granularity as we\u2019re able to give at this point.","Al Kabili \u2013 Macquarie ","Okay, alright, that\u2019s helpful. And then to the degree you can comment on just the order book \u2013 I believe you mentioned volumes were up 2.5% combined Boise and PCA. As you sort of look at the order book to the degree it gives you some visibility there, how is that looking versus last year? Are you seeing a notable uptick there because we\u2019ve heard from some others that they have seen that?","Mark Kowlzan","Well, again as I mentioned you know, we talked about the January number up above 2.5% combined PCA and Boise. That was up in terms of a very tough comparable of 11% in the prior year. So again, our 2.5% we feel is a good number considering the big comp from the prior period ten months before.","Paul Stecko","Let me say it another way \u2013 we\u2019ve had some quarters last year where we were up 6%, but last January was an anomaly when you\u2019re up 11%. And so beating an 11% up by a lot is hard to do so yes, the 2.5% we were pretty pleased with compared with what we were comparing it against. So if you wanted to call it an uptick I guess you can \u2013 I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d want to go that far. And then as I said earlier things were exasperated by weather. We had box plants down from several storms and that\u2019s hurt our volume a little bit, but you\u2019re going to recover some of that and we\u2019ll probably recover that if the weather changes in February. So it\u2019s kind of a hard question to answer.","Al Kabili \u2013 Macquarie ","Okay, I appreciate that. And final question I guess, Rick, just housekeeping \u2013 the corporate line item on the segment reporting, is there any flavor you can give us how we should be thinking about what that amount is for the year?","Rick West","I don\u2019t want to predict for the year because we\u2019re continuing to go through the corporate line, and as you get synergies it may change. But I would say that in the past we have kept all corporate overhead as one item when we were one segment; whereas with our reporting in Q4 we are allocating a portion of the corporate overhead to both the paper and the packaging segments, and only retaining the part that\u2019s not allocated which would be more true corporate functions in corporate. So I think it\u2019s a little too soon to do that. We can probably give you a better idea after the end of Q1.","Al Kabili \u2013 Macquarie ","Okay, thanks and good luck the rest of the year.","Operator","Your next question will come from Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo.","Chris Manuel \u2013 Wells Fargo ","Good morning gentlemen, and just a couple follow-up questions for you. First could you maybe help us a little bit with the timing or the phasing as you anticipate the two price increases coming through? How much have you realized thus far, how does that kind of fade through over the balance of the year? Does it typically take a quarter or two for the UFS pricing to phase in?","Judy Lassa","This is Judy, I\u2019ll take that one. So the price increase that we announced back in last quarter, depending on product or grade mix our price realization to date is about $40 to $50 a ton excluding the volume that\u2019s tied to indices. And as we\u2019ve commented in the opening remarks we do have another price increase announced out there but we won\u2019t talk about how that\u2019s going to come in.","Chris Manuel \u2013 Wells Fargo ","Okay.","Paul Stecko","And I think Mark and I and Rick, we\u2019re new again to the white papers business having not been in that segment for about twenty years. But if you look at some of the indices they have tended to but in a little bit of the increase each month. It\u2019s almost like a box price increase as opposed to a containerboard increase that usually goes in on one date. And so that will probably be the case this year but we\u2019ll see.","Chris Manuel \u2013 Wells Fargo ","Okay, so it sounds like you\u2019ve got maybe two thirds of it in there as of the end of the quarter, so the first price increase \u2013 but the rest will be in during this quarter maybe?","Paul Stecko","No, what Judy said is on the businesses that we have unilateral ability to raise the price we\u2019re up the numbers that she gave you; but we have stuff also that\u2019s tied to indices and that moves only when the index moves. So the answer to your question is you have to know how much is tied to indices and how much isn\u2019t and that\u2019s company proprietary information that we don\u2019t discuss with anybody because that information would be useful to our competitors also. So we don\u2019t talk about it.","Chris Manuel \u2013 Wells Fargo ","Got it. Second question is with respect to, you talked about \u2013 and I know you discussed this a few months back as well \u2013 moving up the D2 conversion from kind of midyear towards the end of the year. You alluded to a couple elements in there where you said that you would improve returns and what you wanted out of the business. Can you maybe give us a little color as to how you intend to improve returns? Is it coming from maybe it costing less to put in? Is it coming from maybe it having more capacity from the 300,000 I think that was originally slated to come on? Or is there even an element that you figured out how to lower the cost curve of the new mill when it does come online but at the same capacity? Can you maybe help us a little bit there with what you were able to do?","Mark Kowlzan","Yeah, without getting into the details I can tell you that since the announced acquisition in September we\u2019ve been heavily involved in analyzing and reviewing the entire detailed scope of the project. And again, with my task of heading up the mill integration I\u2019ve personally been involved with all of the engineering staff on a week-to-week basis for reviewing all of this so that\u2019s where that\u2019s all focused.","Paul Stecko","And I would add that we will not share that information with the public until we share it with our Board of Directors. And we\u2019ve got a Board meeting at the end of this month and we owe them a status report on what we\u2019ve found, what we\u2019re going to do, how we\u2019re going to improve the return, etc. Once we do that then we\u2019ll be free to discuss that.","Chris Manuel \u2013 Wells Fargo ","Can you maybe share with us that the plan is still that it\u2019s going to be 300,000 tons when it comes on stream or is it\u2026","Paul Stecko","As I said earlier we\u2019re not talking about any specific detail until we talk to the Board about the detail first, and unfortunately for you, you\u2019re behind our Board in the pecking order. So we\u2019re going to have to stiff you on this one. [laughter]","Chris Manuel \u2013 Wells Fargo ","Okay. Last question I had is I used to have an old number I used for kind of making the CAPEX in the $125 million range for PCA. Including appreciating now that you\u2019re a little bigger with the Boise element in there what would you sort of estimate that sort of a maintenance CAPEX number would be?","Rick West","We\u2019re still looking at that, Chris, and I\u2019m not going to break out and parse out the estimated capital. You know, it\u2019s something that takes a while. As Mark looks at the integration of the mills and what we need to do it\u2019s just too soon. We\u2019ve got the full number and I can\u2019t parse that out at this point.","Mark Kowlzan","Yeah, but you are incorrect about the number. Our CAPEX number varied through the last decade say from $110 million to $125 million. About half of it was maintenance; the other half was a project to improve profitability and reduce costs. So you had the right number but only half of that is pure maintenance capital. The other half involves the capacity addition and things of that nature.","Chris Manuel \u2013 Wells Fargo ","Okay, thank you and good luck, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Cherecover with D.A. Davidson.","Steve Chercover \u2013 D.A. Davidson","Good morning, welcome to the Pacific Northwest. Just a couple quickies to kind of follow on to Mr. Weintraub\u2019s questions. It\u2019s appropriate that Walulla\u2019s now in packaging. Am I correct that newsprint is still in the packaging segment as well?","Rick West","That is correct.","Steve Chercover \u2013 D.A. Davidson","Okay, and along that line it appeared that Boise\u2019s packaging margins were well below your historical margins and that made us a little nervous, but your margins in Q4 were kind of in line with your generally terrific margins. Have you already fixed the system or is that due in part to the re-segmentation?","Mark Kowlzan","We\u2019ll let Tom Hassfurther answer that.","Tom Hassfurther","Steve, this is Tom here, I\u2019ll comment on that. You know, we\u2019ve already done a lot on the packaging side of the business, obviously starting with headcount which we discussed earlier. We\u2019ve brought a lot of operation expertise to Boise which has already begun to yield some results. The geographic footprint is important to us and has allowed us to expand some customer base into the Pacific Northwest where we did not have a footprint before.","But I\u2019d just say as we talk about many acquisitions, one of the most important aspects of any acquisition \u2013 and that includes all of PCA \u2013 is the people. And you know, the people that make the difference at Boise, we\u2019re very, very pleased with them, the progress they\u2019re making. There\u2019s a great opportunity in my opinion to continue to bring Boise into the PCA culture which gets them focused on much more hard-to-do value added business and getting paid appropriately for it. So I think there\u2019s a lot of upside in those plants and we\u2019re very, very encouraged with the improvement they\u2019ve made already.","Steve Chercover \u2013 D.A. Davidson","So if pricing and input costs were to remain constant we should see these kind of low-20% EBITDA margins approach the mid-20%s I suppose.","Rick West","I would say yes. And you have to remember when you look at Boise, even in terms of volume, we were about three times the size of Boise anyway. So acquiring the Boise packaging business was about a quarter bigger than us so you have to factor that into how you look at the margins and the average. But as Tom said we\u2019re very happy.","Steve Chercover \u2013 D.A. Davidson","Terrific. And one other quick clarification please. I think you said embedded in the $0.20 accretion from Boise there was $0.06 associated with interest. Can you just clarify was that to your benefit or it might have actually been $0.26 without that interest hit?","Rick West","You\u2019re correct in your last statement. What we did is we had to take on debt to acquire Boise so we felt it was appropriate to take the entire interest expense on that new debt and for reporting purposes this one quarter apply that interest expense of $0.06 against the Boise earnings on a standalone basis. So therefore before interest it was $0.26 per share; after the full interest to acquire Boise it was $0.20 a share.","Paul Stecko","And the other reason we did that is we had given guidance to the street before the Boise acquisition of $0.84 for PCA. So we wanted to have a valid comparison of how did we do against the $0.84 target, and so that\u2019s why we isolated that interest to Boise. And PCA actually came in at $0.84 on that side and Boise took the entire brunt of that interest expense, which we thought that was a fair way to do it. So without that interest expense it would have been $0.06 higher at Boise. (Inaudible) going forward as we do a more normal allocation.","Steve Chercover \u2013 D.A. Davidson","And by extension if we annualize it, it could be more like $1.40 than $1.20 I suppose, the accretion.","Paul Stecko","As we said earlier we don\u2019t really want to get into that number, and in the future quarters we will probably report only PCA earnings and will not isolate Boise as a separate. ","Steve Chercover \u2013 D.A. Davidson","Okay, well you\u2019re one company. Congratulations, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research.","John Tumazos \u2013 John Tumazos Very Independent Research","Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on all your great achievements. In terms of the DeRidder project, my question is do you believe that the capital costs can be accurately estimated? My impression is there\u2019s a plethora of natural gas and oil-related projects in Louisiana. There was just a project of Shell that the capital overran 60% in the first four months of studies and they canceled it. My impression is it\u2019s very hard to get contractors these days because of the oil and gas boom.","Mark Kowlzan","You know, as we\u2019ve looked at the project we\u2019ve also been meeting with the general contractors and I\u2019m not concerned with that right now.

Your host today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chief Executive Officer of PCA. Upon conclusion of his narrative, there will be a Q&A session. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kowlzan, and please proceed when you are ready.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Good morning, and welcome to Packaging Corporation of America's Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. I'm Mark Kowlzan, CEO of PCA; and with me on the call today is Paul Stecko, Executive Chairman of PCA; Tom Hassfurther, who runs our Corrugated business; and Rick West, PCA's Chief Financial Officer.  Thanks for participating in this call this morning, and after the presentation, we'll be glad to take any questions.","Yesterday, we reported third quarter net income of $40 million or $0.41 per share, which included after-tax debt refinancing charges of $13 million or $0.14 per share. Excluding these charges, earnings were $53 million or $0.55 per share compared to third quarter 2011 earnings of $43 million or $0.43 per share. Net sales were a record $723 million, up 8% compared to third quarter 2011 net sales of $671 million. The $0.12 per share earnings increase, excluding special items, was driven by higher containerboard and corrugated products volume of $0.07; and lower costs for energy, $0.05; recycled fiber, $0.04; and chemicals, $0.02. These items were partially offset by higher costs for labor and benefits, $0.03; interest, $0.02; and depreciation, $0.02. Excluding special items, net income for the first 9 months of 2012 was a record $142 million or $1.45 per share compared to $122 million or $1.21 per share in 2011. This earnings increase of $0.24 per share was driven by higher containerboard and corrugated products volume of $0.23; lower costs for energy, $0.14; recycled fiber, $0.08; and chemicals, $0.05; and a lower share count from share repurchases of $0.04. These items were partially offset by higher costs for labor and benefits of $0.09; depreciation, $0.07; interest, $0.06; transportation, $0.04; and lower export pricing, $0.05. Year-to-date net sales were a record $2.1 billion, up 7% over 2011.","In summary, we had a very strong quarter in all aspects of our operations. Our mills ran extremely well, setting an all-time production record. Containerboard and corrugated products demand remained strong, costs improved significantly and sales prices began to improve.","Moving to more details of the quarter, higher mill production and corrugated products volume improved our earnings by $0.07 per share compared to last year's third quarter. Our corrugated shipments were up 5.7% on a per-workday basis compared to last year's third quarter, including 3.1% from box plant acquisitions, and up 4% in total, with one less shipping day this quarter. Our shipments per workday were up each month of the quarter compared to last year, and in September, we've set an all-time record for shipments per workday, both including and excluding acquisitions. Our domestic and export containerboard demand remained strong, and we're able to sell more tons to the export market with our mill annual maintenance outages completed in the second quarter. Our export shipments of containerboard were up about 9,000 tons compared to last year's third quarter and up about 21,000 tons compared to the second quarter of this year. Domestic containerboard sales were essentially flat with both third quarter of last year and the second quarter of this year. Our mills produced 670,000 tons of containerboard, an all-time record, up 20,000 tons or 3% over the third quarter of 2011. This performance was driven by production increases primarily from the energy project at our Counce, Tennessee and Valdosta, Georgia linerboard mills and no energy project-related downtime this year.","We ended the quarter with our containerboard inventories down 9,000 tons compared to the end of the second quarter. Our inventory situation here is rather tight, considering October has 23 corrugated product shipping days compared to only 19 days in September. So it is essential that our mills continue to run well on October, which they have through the first 15 days of the month.","Looking at pricing, we implemented a $50 per ton domestic containerboard price increase during the third quarter and are now in the process of implementing a corresponding price increase for corrugated products, which we expect to essentially complete in the fourth quarter. We did announce export price increases to most markets in September, but for the third quarter, export prices were down from last year.","Moving to costs, energy costs were down $0.05 per share compared to last year's third quarter, driven mostly by the energy project and to a lesser extent, by lower natural gas costs in our box plants. Chemical costs were down $0.02 per share, with lower usage driven by the energy project. Lower recycled fiber costs improved earnings by $0.04 per share as industry published prices for old corrugated containers, or OCC, excluding the delivery costs, were down about $70 a ton in the third quarter of 2012 compared to the third quarter of last year. Finally, depreciation expense was up $0.02 per share compared to last year's third quarter, driven by the energy project, corrugated products' strategic capital expenditures and newly-acquired box plants. Interest expense was up $0.02 per share, driven by non-capitalization of interest.","I'm now going to turn it over to Rick West, our CFO, who'll give you an update on our generation and uses of cash and taxes.","Richard B. West","Thank you, Mark. In the third quarter, PCA generated cash from operations of $102 million. Capital expenditures were $25 million. We paid our quarterly common stock dividend of approximately $24.5 million and repurchased 253,000 shares of our common stock for about $32.50 per share or $8 million. As of September 30, 2012, our diluted shares outstanding were 97.3 million shares. Cash tax payments of $2 million were made, and fuel credits of $22 million were used to offset federal taxes. We have estimated remaining fuel tax credits above $279 million. The final amount of the available fuel tax credits and the final cash tax rate and taxes paid in 2012 is contingent upon the conclusion of the IRS audit currently underway.","On July 26, we completed the redemption of our 5.75% notes due in 2013 with a redemption premium payment of $21 million, which resulted in third quarter after-tax charges of $13 million or $0.14 per share.","We ended the third quarter with $141 million in cash, up $23 million from our second quarter ending cash, if you exclude the cash proceeds we had on hand at the end of the second quarter from our debt offering. Our debt at the end of the third quarter was $797 million.","With that, I will turn it back over to Mark.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Thank you, Rick. We completed our major energy project in last year's fourth quarter and now have almost a full year of operations behind us. I'm very pleased to report that the project is delivering more benefits than we originally forecasted, and we now estimate the project will improve 2012 earnings by about $0.37 per share compared to our original estimate of $0.26 per share at the beginning of the year. The better-than-expected results came mainly from better-than-anticipated chemical and energy recovery efficiencies associated with the new Valdosta recovery boiler and 2 rebuilt boilers at Counce. The increased process efficiency and more consistent pulp quality has, in turn, allowed us to also increase both our pulp and containerboard production more than we expected.","The operating flexibility we now have with our recovery boilers has also allowed us to avoid some machine downtime this year when our power boilers were down for maintenance and allowed us to eliminate electricity purchases at Valdosta this summer during peak electricity demand periods, when electricity prices were at their highest.","So overall, I'm very pleased with the energy project. The project is generating an after-tax return of about 25% on total capital and almost 30% on net capital after deducting avoided maintenance capital despite much lower fuel and electricity prices today compared to the prices we've built into the project savings. We expect the return will improve even further as energy prices increase over time and we capture those cost avoidance benefits.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect higher earnings from our announced price increases, but full quarter's earnings benefit from these price increases will not be fully realized until the first quarter of 2013. The earnings improvement from higher prices in the fourth quarter is expected to be partially offset by seasonally higher costs due in part to colder weather. Considering these items, we expect fourth quarter earnings of about $0.61 per share.","With that, we'll be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constitute forward-looking statements. These statements were  based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in the annual report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements.","With that, operator, I'd like to open up the call to questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Weintraub of Buckingham Research.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Just, first of all, on the box price increase, to the extent you could give us a little bit more color on how that is progressing relative to other historic initiatives or prior initiatives. And in particular, when you talk about a corresponding increase, should we interpret that meaning that you're shooting for a full passthrough of $50, $55 per ton, or is it conceivable that it could vary from that to the upside? Or any other color you can give on that.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Yes, Mark, for both legal and competitive reasons, we can't get into a lot of detail on forward pricing expectations. But again, as we said during the call, we did build a partial quarter realization into the fourth quarter outlook, and we do expect the full realization into the first quarter of 2013, but just reminding you, historically, we've put box price increases through faster than the competition in part because of our local customer mix. And we'll provide more details during first quarter, our earnings call in January. But also, keeping in mind that with our 9,000 customers, we do go out and talk to all these customers. But in general, historically, we've been successfully completing these pass-throughs ahead of competition. Tom, do you want to add anything to that?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","Not much more than what you said, Mark. I would say that this is -- we're handling this as a routine price increase. As Mark mentioned, we've got 9,000 customers we've got to go out and inform on a one-on-one basis. Because of our value proposition, we can't just send out a letter notifying them of a price increase. So right now, this is an all-consuming job. And as Mark mentioned, we expect the full realization in the first quarter next year.","Paul T. Stecko","And Mark, to the last part of your question -- this is Paul Stecko. The word corresponding, the only intent of that word is it's related to the fact that box prices normally follow containerboard increase. So those 2 are related. And as containerboard price is up, and now box prices have been announced by us. So don't read anything more into that word. In terms of what our realization is, we don't disclose that. That's a matter between us and our customers. And that -- what we charge in boxes varies widely because the nature of our customer and product mix varies widely. And so it's not one number. It's an average number, and average numbers are sometimes misleading. But that's not something we normally disclose until we have completely completed, if you will, our box price increase.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And then a question, if I could, on the dividend and your thoughts about potential changes going forward. You do look like you're going to be reporting record earnings in 2012. And presumably, with the box price increase going in 2013, hopefully, it can be even better. Not that long ago, you were paying $1.20 dividend, and it's lower than that right now. When might you be reconsidering what an appropriate level for the dividend is? And kind of what are the key criteria that would lead you to conclude what you might conclude?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Mark, as we've historically said, dividend matters are board matters. And so with that, with Paul here, I'm going to let Paul talk about that since he's Chairman of the Board.","Paul T. Stecko","Okay. Thanks, Mark. Appreciate that. It's a complicated question because there's a lot of things that go into it. So just to keep it short, there have been some positive developments with us finally coming to a conclusion on this matter, and that is the price increase is obviously positive. It will obviously produce a lot of cash, which we have to figure out what to do with. The other thing that's happened, since mid-June, our shares have gone from about $25 to a little over $35. That's the good news. The bad news is it's lowered our yield. And so the one way you fix that, obviously, is increase the dividend. So I think they're the 2 positives in terms of getting closure to doing something. The one negative, as I think everybody knows, is the tax situation with regard to the treatment of dividends, which we won't know until the end of the year. But all in all, this is a matter that the board will discuss. And from my perspective, as Chairman of that board, we're getting pretty close to determining what and how much we want to do here. And that's about all I can say at that -- at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chip Dillon, Vertical Research Partners.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","You mentioned the higher earnings you expect from the energy projects, which, I think, gets us to about $0.51. If you could clarify that or verify that. And then also, where do you see your capacity now in light of the expansions? At least, when I looked at the last K, you had about 1,043,000 tons at Counce and 556,000 at Valdosta. Can you just sort of give us an idea of how much increase you think you will be able to get, production-wise, as a result of the projects being better than expected?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Well, I'm going to answer part of that, and I'm going to let Rick walk you through the reconciliation of the returns. But if you think about our capacity, at the beginning of the year, we've got announced capacity of 2,575,000 tons. It looks like we're on a run rate of about 2.6 million, 2,600,000 tons. With that, obviously, we did see some benefit. Starting in 2010, when we made some of the paper machine modifications at Valdosta as part of the capital project for drying efficiency improvements, we've added about 120,000 tons of capacity or about 5% over the 3-year period. Now we're not going to sustain that type of rate. We'll be back into the normal type of creep, 1% or so. With that, Rick, why don't you walk through the reconciliation of returns?","Richard B. West","Yes, Chip, the number you referenced, of course, that was more in line with what the original project was than we've had some things that happened, lower -- as Mark mentioned, lower fuel and electricity prices than what we've built into the project, which have been offset by some better productivity than we expected. But just to put everything in perspective, as you recall, at the beginning of the year, we said in 2012, we expected $0.21 per share in direct benefits from the project. That included savings, incremental profit less the added depreciation for this year. Also, we expected $0.10 per share in avoided downtime, and that was partially offset by $0.05 per share in higher interest expense from the non-capitalization of interest. And that gave us a total earnings improvement from the energy project in 2012 of $0.26 per share. Now if you look at our reported numbers, we have avoided the downtime, and we're getting the $0.10 per share and avoided the downtime, and it's just what we were looking at, at the beginning of the year. And as you saw from our results, our interest expense is up, attributable to the capitalized interest. So the capitalized interest of $0.05 is essentially the same. However, the direct benefits from the projects have increased from $0.21 per share to $0.32 per share, which increases the total earnings benefit in 2012 to $0.37 per share. Now the additional improvement in earnings of $0.11 per share is really coming from 3 areas. One, an additional $0.01 per share from energy cost savings. Energy prices have not gone up this year. Over time, that number will improve, as Mark said in his comments. This year, we're also getting an additional $0.05 per share from chemical cost savings. And finally, we're getting an additional $0.05 per share from more productivity and production increases than we expected at the beginning of the year. So now go back and look at the energy project from where we started in, really, 2009, when we came up with the estimates, and where we're looking at today and toward the future, overall, the 3 biggest benefits of the energy project are energy cost reduction, incremental production and chemical savings, in that order. Now I'll turn it over to Mark, and he may have some more comments on how we were able to achieve these higher-than-expected benefits this year.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Well, again, when you think about our recovery boiler, you're trying to achieve 2 different things here. You're trying to achieve steam generation with the organic composition, and also, you're trying to recover cooking chemicals. So you've got a very complex reaction taking place at the bottom of the boiler, in the reduction zone. So we knew we were going to essentially double the amount of steam generation with these boilers, but we were pleasantly surprised with the efficiency gains and the chemical reduction efficiencies in the units both at Valdosta and Counce, which now have allowed us to produce essentially more cooking liquor, more uniform pulp and more pulp in general. So that lent itself to more paper machine productivity, so again, quite an added benefit from the project.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Okay. Well, that's very helpful color. And one other question, I was sort of looking back, and if you study calendars, which I do find better things to do, but on my cursory look, we average about 20.4 shipping days in September normally. And so given 100,000 a day shipment rate, it looked like the inventory situation this month that was reported this morning would normally have about 140,000, if you will, ton headwind that it seems like that didn't impact inventories at all. We still had the normal increase. And I thought -- I don't know if you had any comment about why you thought that was the case. Is it more that -- I mean, the production seemed to be high. I can only conclude that there just weren't the tons available to get out into the marketplace, but maybe you have better color than I have.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Yes, with only 19 box plant workdays in September, which is the minimum number, I would have expected a bigger inventory increase. On the other hand, we had hoped to build about 10,000 tons of, specifically PCA, of inventory to get ready for October. October has 23 cut-up days. However, we weren't able to build any inventory in September because our demand remained so strong. So maybe we should not be surprised.","Paul T. Stecko","Yes, let me just amplify. September is a strange month. What we've discovered, it's like discovering Halley's Comet. Maybe we should've known it. But it's been since -- like 1984 was the last time there was a 2-day difference in shipping days year-over-year. So usually, it's only 1 day. And so we would have thought, with that few shipping days, the inventories would have risen more, but they didn't. And I don't know if people took downtime in the industry. I know we couldn't build inventory because our demand was strong. September was a record, for us, volume day on a per-workday basis. So I really don't have a good explanation for that. But one other point on that, I saw the FBA numbers this morning, and it showed that roughly, on a per-workday basis, demand was up about 2.5%, and on the total volume, it was down about 7% or so. I don't have the exact numbers in front of me, but that's close. And what we normally do is average the 2 numbers. But you really shouldn't do that at this time because it's such a rare event that there's 2 days difference. You simply can't make up 2 full days during a month. So the kind of the way -- if somebody asked me how would you put your spin on the numbers, I would deduct one of those days, and that would make the total volume down about 2.5%; on a per workday, up 2.5%. So it kind of feels like a flat month to us for the -- I would say the industry, it feels like a flat month for them year-over-year, whereas we're up 5% and down 2.5%. So we're up a couple of percent. So it's kind of tracking the way it's been tracking all year. Comparing PCA to the industry, on organic growth, we've been 2% to 3% better. And then if you throw our acquisitions in, we're about 6% better. But it's a strange month. This hasn't happened since 1984, when we've had a 2-day difference in shipping days, and that does skew the numbers somewhat.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Wilde from Deutsche Bank.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a question on export pricing. I noticed that you noted that in the first 9 months, lower export prices were about a $0.05 drag year-to-date. I wondered if you could give us some sense of whether there's still a drag as you see them here in October?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Well, again, as most of you probably know, we're not a big export player, but we did raise export prices in September to a majority of the markets we serve. And if you think about it, we do business in approximately 35 countries. Of those 35 countries, we probably have 5 larger countries that we ship probably 55% or so of our volumes. But we don't make a practice of commenting on specific prices in specific markets for competitive reasons. So with that, we're getting better but not as good as domestic pricing.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And can you just, Mark, can you just give us a little more color just generally on what you're seeing in exports? Because I'm hearing about some very long backlogs on export sales right now, maybe some people even out in 2013. Can you provide any color?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","Hey, Mark, this is Tom. Again, as Mark mentioned earlier, I mean, we're a smaller player in the export market. But I can tell you that demand is steady to up depending on the market. And certainly, the backlogs are getting out there. There's no question about that.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. But I just have a couple of other questions. Mark, any thoughts on other capital projects that may be looming over the next 2 or 3 years for PCA?","Mark W. Kowlzan","We don't have any big projects like these energy projects right now, and we have the typical smaller-capital-requirement projects that allow us to continue to build on efficiencies and enhance the efficiencies in a smaller way. But with that, we always have a portfolio of opportunities in both the box plants and the mills but nothing of the magnitude that we saw with the big energy project.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just my final question. Can you just give us an update on what you're seeing in wood fiber costs and around your different fiber baskets?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Prices are pretty flat both north and south, so as we get ready and while we're completing our winter wood build right now, the prices are flat.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari of Citi.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Can you talk about how shipments have trended over the first couple weeks of the month? And then maybe more broadly, you outperformed the industry again on volumes this quarter. I was wondering what you think a sustainable organic growth rate for you is. Can you sustain the kind of 2% to 3% growth that we've seen this year maybe going into next year?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Yes, if you look at the first 9 days of October, our bookings are up about 6% through this period of time compared to a very strong October last year. Billings are essentially flat. We're getting cut-ups very strong, and billings always catch up with bookings over the course of the month. Tom, you want to elaborate on that?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","Well, Anthony, I would just say that we have always -- we've said we'll continue to look for every opportunity we can, certainly, in terms of acquisitions. So we may -- we'll continue to look for those. Organically, we've had a pretty normalized rate here for quite some time, and we would continue to see that rate going forward. That would be our expectation.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And when you think about box shipment growth in the U.S. or sort of industry-wide, I mean, it's basically been flat this year, as you mentioned. When you look into 2013, is there anything that you're seeing in any particular category, like food or beverage or other products, that would make you think that 2013 should be maybe a better volume year for the industry or maybe the same? Or how are you kind of thinking about those volumes?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Well, at this point in time, I don't think anybody sees anything out there on the horizon that's going to be a dramatic shift. However, I'd like to think that it can't get a hell of a lot worse than where we've been, and we're bound to get a little bit better. Certainly, one of the concerns that we have is any uptick, given the inventory rates we have right now, is going to make things even tighter than they are at the moment. So we'll just -- we continue to do what we do and let the economy take care of itself. But hopefully, there will be some uptick going forward.","Paul T. Stecko","Yes, I mean, Anthony, both presidential candidates are talking about jobs, and both have said jobs is very important. And if we can get unemployment to continue to drop, that will be very positive for our industry. And of course, I think we're all familiar with a lot of the anecdotal information reported in the papers about people moving manufacturing back to the U.S. I think it's started a little bit, but obviously, we need more of that. That's probably the best thing that the country could do to get out of the deficit situation, and that is to grow our way out of it. And so long term, we feel fairly positive about where the U.S. economy is going to go because it has to go there. Picking when that starting point is, however, is not so easy.","Operator","The next question is from George Staphos of Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wondered if maybe we could pick up on that line of questioning that Anthony had started. If we look at this year, certainly, it's not been a great year in terms of volume through the retail chain for a lot of the food and beverage products because of food inflation. Yet, as I recall, you're not huge in agriculture, but it's not been the world's greatest ag season as well. Are your food processing and food-related customers talking at all, with any kind of data that would suggest that next year could be a better year than what's been probably a pretty challenging year, this year in 2012?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","Well, George, this is Tom. I'll just comment on this real quick. I mean, most of our customers, obviously, they tend to be fairly optimistic about their business and they hope that there's improvement going forward. I can tell you they're trying to do everything they possibly can, from a marketing point of view, to move their products. And I think, at the end of the day, just like any other year, there'll be some winners and there'll be some losers. And it's in our best interest to, obviously, to try to align with the winners. And I think one of our advantages is, with the 9,000 customer base that we have, we're spread out very well, so that we have the ability to grow with a lot of different customers and we don't have tremendous exposure to just 1 or 2.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Next question I had was on inventory position. Your inventory trend in the quarter surprised me. I would have expected flat, maybe up. Sounded like that's where you were trending. Explain to us if there is any operational issues you're having now by being so tight on inventory and what your goals would be for inventory in the fourth quarter coming up.","Richard B. West","Yes, George. We continue to run full out. For the third quarter, we're running at a run rate over 100% capacity. And so, we continue -- first 15 days of the month, we continue on that trend. We did take advantage of supplying some of our legacy customers that requested some extra tons on the export side of the business during the third quarter, so we weren't able to build inventory. But right now, I think, again, the mills just have to continue running at the pace they're running and to supply Tom's needs, and our export and domestic customer needs.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Mark, I don't know if you could comment to this, but was there a greater-than-normal trend in this past quarter for other producers asking you for tons that would normally be the case in the third quarter?","Mark W. Kowlzan","We generally don't comment on those matters.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay.","Paul T. Stecko","George, it's Paul. I think Mark has a very good point in terms of inventory. We hope to build some inventory. We were running so well, we decided to take the risk, if you will, to ship more to some export customers who we cut back, right, and we tried to help them out a little bit. And that bet was, we can continue to run well. And there's always a trade-off. If we don't, we probably wished we had kept those tons, but if we do, we'll be happy we sold them. And so we're betting that we could continue to run this well, and one of the reasons we're fairly confident about the bet, we still -- we're only 4 or 5 months beyond the annual shutdowns, so our mills are still in tip-top shape. And where you really start to worry, when you get into the first quarter, when it's the coldest quarter, and you've got now 9, 10 months on your equipment, that's when the productivity risks are greatest. And right now, we've got the wind on our back, productivity-wise, so we're going to ride that horse as hard as we can.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got you. Last quick one, I'll turn it over. Is it possible to discuss at all, either in an index term or percentage terms, what the overall cash cost performance at the mills have been this year? Clearly, it's gotten better, the energy products have been a success. But obviously, the way the company reports, which is consistent with the way the other companies in the industry report, on integrated basis plus changes in mixes, at the box plant level over tons, impairs comparability. So could you help us understand how you've improved in cash cost efficiency at the mills this year?","Mark W. Kowlzan","George, regarding that, obviously, we're not going to give any specifics with the exception to say that the energy projects have delivered great results and we've seen the benefits of the improvements at both Valdosta and Counce. And then just every year, we're always working on continuing to improve the efficiencies. That\u2019s all I really want to say about that. Paul, do you have anything to add?","Paul T. Stecko","No, other than -- you said it. Our actual data, actual costs, are company confidential information. And for competitive reasons, we choose not to disclose that.","Paul T. Stecko","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question, with the containerboard production up 3% year-over-year in the third quarter, how do you expect that to continue to progress, as we think ahead to, say, next year? I mean, do you think you can continue at this 3% rate? Or some of that, perhaps, was some of that from the energy projects we should expect a lower rate moving forward?","Paul T. Stecko","Going forward, we should be at the normal creep rate, 1% type normal creep. We took advantage, obviously, of the energy projects through the 2010 and '11 activity at Valdosta and Counce, and saw that nice 3% bump. So that was a onetime event for us, and as I explained on one of the earlier questions, we have no plans, as far as capital right now, to go after any aggressive creep. So and going forward, it's going to be typical flat, 1% type of activity.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then just one follow-up question on the pricing. When you said you expect to be essentially complete in the fourth quarter, should I read that to mean that kind of full run rate will be in there, kind of exiting December? Or is there still some carryover that we should be thinking about, just from a timing perspective?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Now our forecast, at this point in time, Phil, is that we'll have the full run rate going in into the first quarter of next year. We obviously have some contracts that extend out a little bit further than that, which may add just a little bit. But for the most part right now we're forecasting a full run rate.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. And then with the energy projects and the increased savings that are coming from those, is there any carryover benefit into 2013, perhaps from the productivity or the chemicals or anything else you highlighted there, Rick?","Richard B. West","There might be a little bit. We've improved, as we've seen things we could do, as Mark said, with the cooking and chemical recovery process, we got a little bit more during the year. So average-on-average, from 2012 to 2013, productivity may come up a little bit, but that's built in to the 1% that Mark talked about of creep.","Thomas A. Hassfurther","Yes. The other thing, Phil, that we've discovered, as you always do on a project like this is, is that when you get done, there's a few more things you could tweak that you didn't do in the first project. Now it's not a lot of money and it's not a lot of return, but Mark told me about a project the other day, probably going to cost $0.5 million dollars to do, and we'll get a 100% return on that. And that's because the energy project enabled it. But it's just a small thing, a $0.5 million in improved earnings isn't that much. But we've got a number of those and when you look back at everything, I guess, if you've done something just a touch different, you can get a pretty good return. Unfortunately, it's just a little bit of capital. And even though the return's really good, it doesn't make that much more money. But we do have some upside in those areas.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","All right, okay. And then this is my last question, on the share repurchases. Rick, I think you said it was $8 million in the quarter. So that was a little below the second quarter and if I look at the year-to-date, you're tracking below last year on that front. So maybe you can just kind of comment on, I guess, the philosophy right now around share repurchases? Is some of this driven by how much cash you want to have on hand right now? Or just how do you think about that, in light of the fact that CapEx is down quite a bit from last year, so you do have more cash flow? So I guess I would've thought maybe a bit more on the share repurchase front this year. Maybe you could just give a little color?","Paul T. Stecko","Yes. This is Paul, again. You're right. We didn't do as much last quarter as we normally do. We bought in about $32.50 a share, and the strategy we had been pursuing, which we discussed on last 4 conference calls was that we're going to try to be a little bit more opportunistic than in the past. And that's when it was a very volatile time in Europe, problem in Greece or Spain, the market would get hit over here, everybody got tarred with the same brush. Our stock had dropped $1 or $2 and we'd pick it up. And we were very successful in doing that, buying on the down, when something not related to our business happened in some parts of the world. That really changed, if you look at the third quarter. We basically went up from about, like I said, $27 a share to about $35, $36. And the stock was much less volatile, and those opportunities for a big blip down really never happened. And so we kept waiting and waiting and waiting, and it never happened, and we ended up buying some stock. So I think if the world is more stable, we're going to have to return to more of a more steady, more continuous dollar cost averaging, hopefully on the way up, type of buying strategy. But the old strategy served us well for about 18 to 24 months. But unless the world gets more volatile and there are -- those opportunities don't exist, then we're going to have to buy on a more steady basis going forward. So that remains to be seen. Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Connelly from CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Just one thing, I think we beat the inventory question to death. But can we talk about, more broadly, about working capital, given the acquisitions and where that's going to settle out over the next couple of quarters?","Richard B. West","This is Rick, Mark. From our working capital standpoint, our working capital has increased. As you pointed out, from the acquisitions. If I look at it, I think historically, working capital had been the lowest in the fourth quarter. And I think as we go into the fourth quarter, I do expect working capital to go down. Now the amount of working capital we have on hand will really just be determined by a number of things, price of product, and then AR. I don't see a lot of change in DSO. And number two, is how much inventory you need, in finished goods as well as containerboard. But I think the biggest change in our working capital has been, more so, the acquisitions and a little bit of pickup in finished goods. But I do expect that to go down end of fourth quarter and probably level out a little more over next year.","Paul T. Stecko","Thank you. Next question?","Operator","Our next question is from Joshua Zaret from Longbow Research.","Joshua L. Zaret - Longbow Research LLC","I have a question on the work gain of the commencement of this box price initiative. I mean, in general, and I underline \"in general,\" should we typically think it starts 4 weeks after Pulp and Paper Week raised their price series? Or is it a set date like October 1? And as long as I'm asking this, did you get anything in September on the box side?","Mark W. Kowlzan","We're not going to comment about that, again, for legal reasons. Paul, do you want to add anything to that?","Paul T. Stecko","Yes. Our policy forever has been, when the price increase is over, we comment on it. We do not comment on while it's going on. And that's on advice of counsel for antitrust reasons. And as you know, we're a very litigious society these days, and so we are extra careful to go way beyond what's required for safety reasons. And we did say we completed our containerboard price increase in the third quarter, because it was over and we could say that. We're in the process of a box price increase, so we're going to give no further information than that until we complete it and then we can talk to you a lot about it.","Joshua L. Zaret - Longbow Research LLC","Was there a publicly announced date? Or -- it sounds like there isn't.","Paul T. Stecko","We're not going to comment on that. We have 9,000 customers. We call on them, we don't simply send out a letter. And so you cannot guarantee that you -- you try to get to them as quickly as possible, et cetera, et cetera, but it's not as simple for us as just sending out a letter, because we don't do that. We make personal calls. Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Alex Ovshey of Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","As you look at your M&A pipeline and as we head towards year end and potential tax changes in '13, are you seeing any incremental opportunities come up?","Paul T. Stecko","Tom would have to answer that.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Regarding acquisitions is I would just say that, as we've talked previously, we continually look at acquisitions and we've got some opportunities that are out there that we're vetting at the moment. But we have a very high hurdle rate for these acquisitions. And so you don't have to meet the litmus test, regarding customers, regarding management team, marketplace, et cetera. And we're going through some of those and we continually look at lots and lots and happen to get one here or there that is an absolutely right fit. And we'll continue to do that.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then as I look at your balance sheet, it's in pretty good shape. The leverage ratio is pretty low. Can you just talk about what you believe to be the appropriate leverage for the business. And if we're below that level, how do you see the company getting back to that level?","Richard B. West","I'll take that. We really don't look at it as a leverage ratio. Of course, we watch it. But we think we're at the right debt level that gives us a lot of financial flexibility. We've got low interest rates, low debt, and it really gives us the ability to take advantage of whatever opportunity is out there with the leverage we have. And I think, you can look at it in the way of what do you want to do opportunistically, and we'd rather have that financial flexibility of what would essentially be considered a low leverage to take advantage of those things with our financial flexibility when they might appear. And so, we don't really have any plans to pay down debt. We only have a small term loan. And then in addition to that, we've got very low interest on our other notes. So we're pretty happy with where we're at from a leverage standpoint. But we would not be -- we have the flexibility, if we wanted to borrow, to borrow also.","Jason Marcus","I'll just ask one more question. Can you help us think about the normalized CapEx level for the business? And if you look at years 2010, '11, clearly it was elevated because of energy projects. Probably in '12, it was a little bit lower because you were benefiting from the investments you're making in '10 and '11. And so what's the right way to think about normalized CapEx? And is that a good proxy for 2013?","Richard B. West","Typically, we've seen -- we've run at about 75% depreciation within that $110 million, $120 million level. And if you can look at depreciation, going forward, with the acquisition, where we are on a percentage depreciation, it's going to be in that $120 million range. And then we've also talked to the point that Tom's going to have $50 million to $60 million available for continued acquisition opportunities or box plant strategic activities. So again, we are going to normalize and it's going to be right in that range, $120 million area. Plus the opportunities for Tom's side of the business.","Thomas A. Hassfurther","When we talk about the box plant, I'd also add, we've said for a long time, we run at about $110 million, and we like to spend about $50 million a year on box plant acquisitions. That's kind of been our mantra for the last 5 years. So that $110 million has probably creeped up to $120 million because if we make these acquisitions they need capital to be supported, too. So as we get bigger, we basically have gone from about a $2.1 billion company, we're close to $3 billion now. So obviously it requires a little bit more CapEx. The only other change that I think we've talked about a little bit is that Tom is out looking for acquisitions but those acquisitions also compete against his internal projects. And so that $50 million is for either acquisitions or if he's got a better internal project for there. So that internal project would go into the CapEx number, but it really comes out of the acquisition pot. And so wherever we have the best investment for that $50 million, and usually it's an acquisition because it's got a lot of synergy benefits, but occasionally, it's for an internal acquisition, like the plant we built in Reading, 1.5 years ago. And so, I throw that caveat, the competition for these acquisition dollars is king and it's both internal and external. Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Al Kabili from Credit Suisse.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just wanted to circle up a little on the acquisition front. And with the M&A you've done on the box plant side, you were still able to increase your year-over-year, your sales of containerboard to the outside. And I was wondering if you could comment on that. I would have thought your integration rates would be going up with the box plant acquisitions. Is this just a function of the higher capacity from the -- on the mill side from the energy projects? Or could you just help us through that.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Again, the energy projects allowed us to grow the containerboard production by 120,000 tons. At the same time, we've been talking about our plans on the box plant side to grow the integration level from 80% up to the low 90s, and currently, we're selling -- we're roughly 83% integrated. And so, we've been able to produce the tons necessary to continue supplying the market. And also, at the same time as we've made these acquisitions, supply those acquisitions. And so with that, again, things are going to level out though.","Paul T. Stecko","Yes, I think the level out is an important comment. It's been a tough job to get the integration level up when you're also increasing your mill capacity, but we're up about 3% over the last couple of years despite the additional capacity in our mills. But as Mark said earlier on the call, we're down to maybe 1% creep growth. So Tom Hassfurther's going to have a little easier time building that integration level up because the mill production is not going to be going up as fast as it has been.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. All right, that's helpful. And also, if you could help just us a little on the fourth quarter, you lapped some of the box plant acquisitions. Can you help us with what acquisitions helped on shipments in the fourth quarter? Is it still that 3% kind of rate in the fourth quarter? Or does that go down a little bit, because you lapped some of the M&A?","Mark W. Kowlzan","I think we had one acquisition we made last year in the fourth quarter. So it won't be 3, it'll probably be more like 2. We caught up to that one we made in the fourth quarter last year.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Great, that's helpful. And then just a final question, is just on mix. You talked last quarter how mix was a little better than you had expected. And I was wondering if you could talk about what you saw on product mix this quarter. And then a follow-up to that mix question is, with price hikes coming, are you seeing from customers increased interest in further lightweighting, or any response from mix on that as well?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","This is Tom, Al. I would just say that, from a mix point of view, it's been pretty steady, not a dramatic change. And regarding the lightweighting, I think every customer out there is looking for an opportunity to reduce cost, but at the same time, they're not going to sacrifice quality in any way. So I think there's a constant pursuit in the marketplace for reduced costs. And we're working -- we work with all our customers to try to do what's right and to try to meet their objectives, but at the same time make sure that we maintain the quality and service that they demand. Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Chercover from D.A. Davidson.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","I, too, had a question on mix. Are you seeing any benefit from the return of manufacturing to the U.S. that you alluded to? And also, are you seeing kind of incremental volumes to the white good products? I'm thinking appliances for housing recovery.","Paul T. Stecko","Yes. This is Paul. I would say we're -- yes, we're seeing some benefit in that. I used to hear once a week from the box side of the business that this customer or that customer was shifting business to Mexico or China. I don't hear that anymore. And we're also hearing information that -- and we know of some of our customers that have moved some business back from Mexico or China. The amounts to this point are small, but we expect that trend to continue. And so, we really can't quantify it any more than that.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","That's encouraging. Even if it's embryonic, it's a start.","Paul T. Stecko","Yes, that's a good way to put it.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Other quick question. In your fourth quarter outlook, you mentioned higher cost due to weather. Did you incorporate flat OCC or do you have any inflation built in there?","Paul T. Stecko","The OCC is flat. We've seen numbers, obviously, the Southeast area, OCC is up about $5. But all in all, we're flat. And that's what we've built into the fourth quarter. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Philip Ng of Jefferies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just had a longer-term question. The industry has obviously benefited quite a bit from the consolidation on the containerboard level. I just want to get a sense, do you think there needs to be more consolidation on the box side just to improve returns going forward?","Mark W. Kowlzan","We're not going to comment about that, again, for legal reasons.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's fine. And then based on what you guys mentioned earlier about CapEx being potentially being in that $110 million, $120 million ballpark and $50 million to $60 million acquisitions, 2013 is shaping up as a record for cash flow year for you. So in terms of the remaining piece, in terms of cash flow deployments, should we think about it as being return to shareholders or how should we think about that going forward?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Well, yes. I think you heard Paul talk earlier to the dividend question. So the fact that we've spelled out our plans for capital, we have no plans to pay down debt, so that leaves that cash available for share buyback and dividends, so at some ratio of the 2. Again, that's where we're headed into the new year.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of OCC, you mentioned that you're baking in flat OCC prices for 4Q. But I guess my question is, the drop off that occurred during 3Q, will that cycle through into 4Q? Or the benefit already kicked in, in 3Q already?","Mark W. Kowlzan","We don't talk about guidance into the forward quarters like that. But again, I think, to summarize, it all depends on China. Think about that.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And this one last final question on the M&A side, a few of the companies I cover, not in containerboard, have kind of mentioned how multiples have come in a little bit due to current macro backdrop that given the fact that the industry is getting price increase, have you seen multiples come -- actually move higher given the current backdrop?","Mark W. Kowlzan","No. We don't have anything, really, to comment on that.","Richard B. West","We're not -- that's what analysts do. We don't -- we're not smart enough to comment on multiple changes. Our multiple is up this year, obviously, for, I think, our performance and what people think of the future. But predicting, I can't even predict where our stock price is going, let alone multiple. So we can't add any value to that.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","In terms of what kind of multiples for the stuff that you could buy, I guess, in the pipeline, has that changed directionally?","Richard B. West","We're not going to comment on that.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Thank you. We've got time for one more question.","Operator","Our next question is from Scott Gaffner of Barclays.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a logistical question on the box price increase. I mean, you did say it was an all-consuming effort going out to these 9,000 customers. But I would assume that a certain percentage of your customers are on some sort of index that makes the conversation a little bit easier. Can you talk about what percentage of customers are on some sort of index, as far as the containerboard price increase flowing through and how that will affect the discussion?","Mark W. Kowlzan","No, I'm not going to comment on that. I will just say that the discussion is as important with every single customer, regardless of whether they're on or off some sort of an index.","Richard B. West","And It's not that we don't want to disclose information to you, we just don't like to disclose that information to competitors. There's no upside to that.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","No, I can appreciate that. Just looking at the energy cost. I mean, you noted that the energy projects were ahead of schedule this year. Obviously, more of a benefit than you expected. But the natural gas prices have risen a little bit recently. How do you think about that when we move into 2013, if they were to stay at this level? How does that impact your business? And then just sort of a follow-up on that, when you look at the seasonality of your purchased energy versus internally supplied, how does that change, as we move through the year?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Natural gas is such a small component of our energy, that it's really not a big factor. So in that regard, again, we just use very low natural gas. So that's about all I really want to say.","Richard B. West","And it really doesn't change seasonally, except that the fact that in the winter months, you use more energy on the 3 coldest months of the year, primarily because your water temperature is a lot colder, and you got to heat a lot of water up to make paper. So and -- the one thing just to point out on our Valdosta mill, we're now to the point now where other than in the line kiln, where we do burn a little -- we burn natural gas, we don't use any fossil fuel at all at Valdosta. We run the mill, well again except for the line kiln, on 100% wood waste and black liquor. And so -- and Counce isn't quite as good, but Counce is pretty good in that regard, too.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right, okay. Just lastly on how we should think about, directionally, maintenance downtime as we move into 2013? I would assume you're in a pretty good position based off of the energy projects and some of the work you've done over the last couple of years. Should we think about -- and you got some benefit it looks like in the first half of 2012 from lower downtime, maintenance downtime. Should we think about that repeating again in 2013?","Paul T. Stecko","We're right in the process of planning next year's shutdown. So we'll be able to add details on the January earnings call. But essentially, the shutdowns are normalized year-to-year with required work, but we'll add the details on January.","Mark W. Kowlzan","I think the other -- the only thing I'll add to that is we did say, when we talked about returns of voided capital, and with Valdosta and Counce, with the new boilers, there would've been about $80 million of capital spent over about a 5-year period that won't have to be spent now on maintenance because these are -- they're virtually new boilers. So going down on that regard, our maintenance expense will be less.","Paul T. Stecko","Okay. With that, we're out of time. I appreciate everybody's time today on the call. We look forward to seeing you in January for the full-year and fourth quarter call. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentleman, this concludes the conference for today.

Your host today will be Mr. Mark Kowlzan, Chief Executive Officer of PCA. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference call over to Mr. Kowlzan, and please proceed when you are ready.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Good morning, and welcome to Packaging Corporation of America's Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. I'm Mark Kowlzan, CEO of PCA, and with me on the call today is Paul Stecko, our Executive Chairman; Tom Hassfurther, who runs our Corrugated business; and Rick West, PCA's Chief Financial Officer. Thanks for participating in the call this morning, and after the presentation, we'll be glad to take any questions.","Yesterday, we reported second quarter net income of $45 million or $0.46 per share, which included after-tax debt refinancing charges of $2.5 million or $0.025 per share. Excluding the refinancing charges, earnings were $48 million or $0.49 per share, which is the second quarter record compared to the second quarter 2011 net income of $40 million or $0.39 per share. Net sales were a record $712 million, up 7% compared to the second quarter of 2011 net sales of $665 million.","The $0.10 per share increase in net income, excluding the refinancing charges, was driven by higher containerboard and corrugated products volume of $0.07; and lower costs for energy, $0.05; recycled fiber, $0.02; chemicals, $0.02; and maintenance, $0.02. These items were partially offset by higher costs for transportation of $0.02; medical, $0.02; depreciation, $0.02; and interest expense, $0.02.","Excluding special items, net income for the first 6 months of 2012 was a record $88 million or $0.91 per share compared to the net income for the first 6 months of 2011 of $79 million or $0.78 per share, excluding special items. Year-to-date net sales were record $1.4 billion compared to the $1.3 billion in 2011.","Overall, we had another strong quarter setting several records and generating earnings, excluding special items, $0.04 per share better than the earnings guidance we provided on April 17.","The higher earnings came from better-than-forecasted mill cost and better-than-expected export prices, and better-than-expected mix improvement in the corrugated business. We also achieved all-time record corrugated product shipments and record second quarter mill production despite having 3 of our mills down for their annual maintenance outages during the quarter.","In addition to strong operations, we completed important strategic action during the quarter, the refinancing of $400 million in notes due in 2013. Considering the risks and uncertainties in the debt market, we're very pleased to have this refinancing behind us, and Rick West will provide more details on the refinancing later on the call.","Moving to operations. Higher mill production and corrugated products volume improved our earnings by $0.07 per share compared to last year's second quarter. Our corrugated shipments were strong, up 6.6% both on a total and a per day workday basis compared to last year's second quarter. This increase in shipments included 3.6% from our box plant acquisition in 2011 and our first quarter 2012 acquisition. Even excluding our recent acquisitions, total shipments were a new all-time record for any quarter. Our corrugated shipments volume also improved compared to the first quarter of this year, with total shipments up 2.7% and per workday shipments up 4.3%, with 1 less workday in the second quarter.","Domestic and export containerboard demand remained steady compared to the first quarter. With the higher containerboard consumption at PCA box plants from increased demand and considering that 3 of our mills will be down during the quarter for their annual maintenance outages, we made a decision to sell fewer containerboard tons into the export market. As a result, our export shipments of containerboard were down about 13,000 tons compared to last year's second quarter.","Our mills produced 638,000 tons of containerboard, a second quarter record, up 32,000 tons or 5.3% over the second quarter of 2011. The increase in production was driven by strong productivity and no energy project-related downtime this year. In total, annual mill maintenance outages, including an overhaul for the 23 days of our 50-megawatt turbine generator accounts and major wall panel replacements to the large T2 boiler accounts, resulted in lost production of about 23,000 tons during the quarter.","Pricing for corrugated products and domestic containerboard remained steady. Export prices for containerboard were higher, and our corrugated products mix improved compared to the first quarter. Compared to the second quarter of 2011, corrugated and domestic containerboard pricing was essentially flat and export containerboard prices were lower. The lower export prices reduced our earnings by about $0.01 a share compared to last year's second quarter.","With regards to cost, energy costs were down $0.05 per share compared to last year's second quarter, driven by major energy projects at Counce and Valdosta and by lower natural gas costs in our box plant system. In addition, chemicals and maintenance costs were each down about $0.02 per share, driven by completion of the energy project and reduced spending. Lower recycled fiber costs improved earnings by $0.02 per share in industry published prices for old corrugated containers or OCC. Excluding our delivery costs, we're down about $25 per ton in the second quarter of 2012 compared to the first -- second quarter of last year.","We continue to see more moderate inflationary cost pressures than we did last year. However, some costs did increase compared to last year's second quarter, including outbound transportation costs, up about $0.02 per share; and medical costs, up about $0.02 per share.","In addition, depreciation expense was up $0.02 per share compared to last year's second quarter, driven by the completion of our energy project, corrugated products strategic capital expenditures and newly acquired box plants. Interest expense was up $0.02 per share, driven by non-capitalization of interest with our energy project completion.","I'm now going to turn it over to Rick West, our CFO, who will give you an update on our cash position and our biofuel tax credits.","Richard B. West","Thank you, Mark. In the second quarter, PCA generated cash from operations of $115 million. Capital expenditures were $35 million. We paid our quarterly common stock dividend of approximately $25 million and repurchased 371,000 shares of our common stock for about $27 per share or $10 million.","As of June 30, 2012, our diluted shares outstanding were 97.1 million shares. During the second quarter, cash tax payments of $5 million were made, and fuel credits of $44 million were used to offset federal taxes. We have estimated remaining fuel tax credits of up to $100 million. The final amount of the available fuel tax credits and the final cash tax rate and taxes paid in 2012 is contingent upon the conclusion of the IRS audit currently underway.","As Mark Kowlzan spoke about earlier, we completed a public offering of $400 million, up 3.9% senior notes due in 2022 on June 26. In connection with the offering, we also made a $65.5 million payment to settle an interest rate protection agreement. The net proceeds -- or the note proceeds, excuse me, of $397 million net of fees will be used to complete the redemption of our 5.75% notes due in 2013 on July 26, with an estimated redemption premium payment of $21 million, plus an additional $11 million for accrued and unpaid interest through the redemption date.","We currently estimate third quarter after-tax charges of $13 million or $0.14 per share related to the debt refinance. Our June 26, 2012 press release provides more detail of the refinancing. Excluding both the proceeds and the debt from the senior note offering, we ended the second quarter with $118 million in cash and debt of $801 million.","With that, I will turn it back over to Mark.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Thank you, Rick. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect seasonally higher sales volumes, increased mill production and lower mill costs. With an added note on mill costs, we do expect prices for purchased electricity and chemicals to increase and prices for OCC to decrease compared to the first quarter. Considering these items and excluding the estimated debt refinancing charge, we expect third quarter earnings to be above $0.54 per share.","With that, we'll be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we have made on this call constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors on our annual report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. And finally, we will not comment or respond to any questions concerning forward pricing on today's call. Thank you.","With that, operator, I'd like to open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chip Dillon of Vertical Research Partners.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","First question is, it looks like, Rick, you were saying the net debt ended the quarter at about $683 million, which I believe is about $38 million below the first quarter level. Should we sort of -- I think one element of the numbers that you've laid out, I don't believe included, unless you said upfront, the -- I think it was $57 million in credits you got based on, I guess, the energy projects you did. Did that also come in? And should we view that sort of as an offset to the hedge?","Richard B. West","That is correct, Chip, and you're correct on your numbers. For the second quarter, the net debt was $683 million, with the increase in cash. We did pay down $4 million in debt in the second quarter on our term loan.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Chip, before we go any further, I just want to correct one of the pieces of data, where I commented about OCC prices. Prices for OCC are expected to decrease compared to the second quarter, not the first quarter. So I just wanted to correct that.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Got you. And then when we look at what's left with the black liquor credits, if I'm not mistaken, if -- let's say that you -- that Filer City doesn't go your way, I'll put it that way, the way you view it, then basically, it's -- you're done on the black liquor credits. And -- but if Filer City gets viewed the way you view it, then that would be the $100 million. Is  that -- or some percentage of that, in other words, it all hinges on Filer City at this point. Is that fair?","Richard B. West","That is a fair statement.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Okay. Got you. And then last...","Paul T. Stecko","Chip, this is Paul. The comment I'd make when you said the way you view it versus the way somebody else views it, we expect there's only one way to view this thing. And that is that although the process was different in Filer City in terms of how black liquor's -- to how the liquors converted, that doesn't mean that there's anything out of the ordinary here.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Got you. Got you. And then as we look out at the second half of the year, any major changes either in CapEx or your view toward buybacks?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Chip, we've stated as far as the capital for the year, $110 million was the target, and we're still on target for the $110 million. But we've also commented that we were setting aside approximately $60 million for the acquisition side on the box plants for Tom to work with. And year-to-date, with the box plant acquisition that was completed in February in the Pittsburgh area, we've spent roughly $30 million of that $60 million. So we do have some room left on the acquisition side. So Tom, do you want to comment at all about where you stand this year on some of the opportunities?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","Well, I would just say on the acquisition front, Chip, we constantly look at opportunities. We turned down a much higher percentage, obviously, than we pursue going forward, and we continue to review opportunities as they exist right now. We have, however, taken some of that money out of the acquisition area and plowed it into some strategic capital investments within the box plants, which have some returns that are essentially equal to what an acquisition would give us, and that's primarily based on customer demand.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Got you. And any update on where you stand on the buyback, how much is left?","Richard B. West","There is $117 million left on the buyback.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Gresh of JP Morgan.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just on the OCC comment, I'm just wondering, are you basically just kind of run rating what we're seeing here in July in saying it's going to be lower? Or do you actually think from here, it actually might take another step down?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Run rating what you've seen published and what the data is telling us.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then just on the export pricing, is there any more color you can give us on where you saw the outperformance there versus what you're expecting? Is it a specific region? Or what were you seeing there?","Paul T. Stecko","Yes, this is Paul. I'll take that. The answer is no, except for the fact that when you pull 13,000 tons out of export like you do, you obviously pull out your worst business. So that in itself is going to help your pricing.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And just on the export markets in general, are you seeing any impact on your business right now from the temporary mill shut over in Europe?","Paul T. Stecko","We really don't comment about any specific relationship with customers, and that would fall on that category. So we're going to have to pass on that question.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Last question, Rick, just in terms of the buyback. Is there any reason to think that you guys wouldn't buy back as much this year as you did last year? Is there anything specific going on this year that would limit that or is it more just kind of how you're feeling about the share price?","Richard B. West","There's no reason. We're still going to look at both buyback and other alternative for cash that we've talked about earlier. So we'll just continue to address the buybacks each quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari of Citigroup.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Can you talk about how demand trended through the 3 months of the quarter and maybe how you're seeing it play out in July? And then given the box numbers that came out this morning, can you just talk sort of generally about the current state of demand you're seeing, whether the summer has been stronger than expected, weaker than expected or whatever color you can give?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Yes, for the second quarter, our box numbers were flat. Obviously, we had good numbers, but we saw constant, steady numbers. And if you look at where we are for the first 8 days of the third quarter through July, we're looking at probably 7.2% up for that period of time. But also, one of the difference this year, with the 4th of July being in the middle of the week, it's a tough comparable. So again, the other thing to think about too was that the acquisitions and the organic piece, they're both contributing about equal, 3%, 3.5% on average.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just a couple of questions for Rick. With the net debt about $680 million, do you think that you're kind of at an optimal leverage at this point or would you potentially consider raising the leverage to pursue some opportunities within acquisitions or strategic capital spending? And just how are you kind of generally thinking about that?","Richard B. West","Well, we look at more the financial flexibility that we have. We think we've got a reasonable debt level, but the positive for us in having the debt level that we do have is it does give us the opportunity if we see something that we want to borrow for us as we did in the third quarter of last year. We borrowed some to -- when we wanted to pick up some additional shares. So what we do with our cash, as well as our debt level, is going to depend upon the opportunity utilizing the flexibility we have.","Paul T. Stecko","And then, Phil, just -- this is Paul again. Just wanted to comment on your first question. As Mark said, our business has been steady all year and up roughly 7% a quarter, and that does include the acquisitions. And through the first 7 days of January, we're up about -- excuse me, July, we're up about the same, and that is on organic growth, which is really the major year-over-year improvement. We're up about 3.6%, 3.7% of that, and then we're up another 3.5%, 3.6% from acquisitions. And that gets back to that 7.2% number. So that's evenly split between organic growth and acquisitions.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And maybe just one last question for Rick. Regarding the IRS audit that determines your kind of final cash tax rate, do you have any sense of the timeframe or how we should think about the resolution of that?","Richard B. West","It's taking what we consider the normal with the IRS. I really can't say anything other to be at the end of the year, beginning of next year. That's what we're hoping to have a final conclusion.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Weintraub of Buckingham Research.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I was hoping to get some sense as to how you see the tenor of the markets right now, because we've got some -- we've seen contrary type of indicators. If you read the headlines, they all look so negative, yet obviously, your business has been doing pretty well in the demand side. And looking at industry statistics, operating rates and inventory seem to be pretty good for the industry, overall. How is this all coming together as you sense the tenor of the market?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Well, again, Mark, if you think about our model and what we've been talking about the last couple of years, with the strategic activity during the past 2 years and the work that Tom's done on the acquisition side of things, we've really created a new revenue engine. And if you also think about it, we've got 4 acquisitions, plus the new Reading plant, so we've got -- we're operating 5 additional plants, plus the strategic spending was applied to 5 plants. So really, we have 10 plants that are now contributing in ways that we never had before. So we've always talked that we have the demand, but we couldn't supply the customer base. We have that now. So we've grown into that and taken advantage of the acquisitions and the strategic spending. So with that, we only know what we're doing and we talk, and our model is definitely a different model compared to the industry.","Paul T. Stecko","Yes, Mark, I'd answer that just a little different. The market has basically met our expectations. We thought our business would be this strong, and it has been this strong. And we're projecting that, that trend is going to continue, and that's how we built our third quarter earnings model. And it's hard to -- for us to comment on the entire market other than we read the numbers you read. But we're really concentrated on our customer base, and we feel pretty good about it.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Fair enough. And typically, you don't take much downtime, if any, in the second half of the year. Would that be your expectation at this juncture?","Mark W. Kowlzan","That's correct. The annual shutdowns are behind us, and now we're on a full run rate mode.","Paul T. Stecko","And Mark, just to amplify on the reason for that, our demand period is the weakest in the winter months, and labor is also a lot more available than to do shutdowns, energy cost is historically higher. So for the last 15 years, we basically concentrated all of our downtime in the first 4 months of the year. It's the lowest cost for us to do it that way, and then it also leaves us the most capacity when we need it the most. And that is the period we're about to enter now, which is the seasonally strong period of the year, now through -- it used to be now through Thanksgiving. But with Internet commerce, December is actually turning out to be a half-decent month for the last 3, 4 years, which it hadn't been before then.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Staphos of Bank of America Securities.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I want to cover a little bit. Can you comment why you think you were able to see some improvement in your mix? What was perhaps behind that, either on the board side or the box side, specifically within domestic?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","George, this is Tom. Why improvement in mix? I mean, it's -- at that time of the year, second quarter seasonally starts to ramp up some of the graphic side of the business.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Right. But you said it was a little bit ahead of your expectation, so I guess I was trying to get at why it was above what the normal seasonality would be.","Thomas A. Hassfurther","Well, I think because our customers are trying to do some creative things to drive their sales in this environment right now, and one of those vehicles happens to be the graphics area. That has -- that picked up seasonally a little faster than what we thought, and probably, on a volume basis for the year, it will be quite a bit higher than we had anticipated. Okay? In addition, you've got Ag business and some of the other things that have gone on that just help our mix typically in the second quarter.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Tom, I know you don't want to speak for the market, but based on history, when you've seen a pickup in the graphics business, is that usually coincident with an ultimate improvement in the broader economy or is it really inconclusive, whether that actually happens to be the case or not from your vantage point?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","I really can't tell you if that's conclusive at all. All I can say is, is that this is -- depending on the customers you're aligned with, depending on their business and what their strategies are really determine how they're trying to drive their business, and if we get the net result of that, we're better off.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Two quick questions on vertical integration in the model. Is there a vertical integration level right now that you think is normal for the existing mix of business that you have in production? And if you could share, what do you think that ratio is right now? And then bigger picture, I mean, the model has worked not just in recent periods, but looking back over time, PCA has continued to probably grow more quickly than the market. Is there a natural limit, do you think, Mark or Paul or Tom, to where are you -- you finally can do that anymore, whether it's sort of a bench and depth issue or a customer opportunity issue that would mean that you ultimately see a limit to the way the business model continues to outperform, if you will?","Mark W. Kowlzan","As we stated, the goal still is to get to the 90% integration rate. That's important because we feel the 90% still allows us some flexibility to supply tons into our customer base as they grow. 100% is not a good number to be at because then your customers then understand that you're going to be limited in that ability to help them grow as they move forward. So we're moving along, we're on track to get to the 90% and that's going to remain our goal for the remainder of the next couple of years here.","Paul T. Stecko","And with regard to your second question, there are limits, but we're nowhere near those limits yet.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Last one. Rick, any benefit from the highway bill and pension for you, do you think, and if there is a number, what might that be?","Richard B. West","No. We're so low. And from where we stand, I don't see it being substantive to us. We haven't really gone through all the math, but I don't see it as substantive.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael (sic) [Mark] Wilde from Deutsche Bank.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Couple of questions, one for Rick. Just maintenance costs, as we go from the second to the third quarter, we know all of your maintenance is done, but do you spread those costs over the year? And how would that change going from the second quarter to the third quarter?","Richard B. West","Really, it doesn't change. The run rate on the amortization of maintenance costs is essentially going to be the same in the third quarter as the second quarter, that's why we didn't cite it in our guidance for any change.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. All right. And Mark, what's a good number for you guys at this point for just the mill volume on an annual basis, do you think?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Are you talking volume or capacity? We can tell you our capacity, we can't tell you our volume.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, capacity.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Well, we published capacity at the end of last year at 2.575 million tons. We hope to get some productivity improvement, some crease -- creep capacities here, not much. So rough number, I wouldn't be surprised if we ended the year at about 2.6 million tons of published capacity.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then last question for Tom Hassfurther. Tom, if demand remains similar to what we've seen in the first half, will you be able to continue that organic growth of about 3% to 3.5%?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","Well, we certainly hope to. That's the intent, Mark. And it's interesting when you look at our organic growth. I mean, most of it comes from our existing customers who have just chosen to do more business with us at various locations, and of course, that helps drive some of our strategic capital. And we continue -- that's the plan going forward. And so I would plan that we would continue to grow at these rates.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And Tom, just curious, is there any kind of -- do you have much of a display business buried within -- in the overall business?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","Yes, we don't typically break out our business, but certainly, we do have a graphics business.","Mark W. Kowlzan","One way we are different, Mark, is that some companies have specific graphic locations. We integrate our graphic business into our regular box plants to make -- and that helps us handle the seasonality of the graphic business. It is stronger in different parts of the year, and the beauty of that, when we need ground business in those plants, when graphic is down, that happens and vice versa. So we like our model in that regard.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Connelly of CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Mark, just a couple of things. Can you give us a sense of what your overall energy mix looks like now and whether you're looking to reduce coal further the way other people are? I'm also interested in how much energy flexibility you have or whether you think that's an old-fashioned concept.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Regarding the first part of the question, if you look at -- obviously, with natural gas prices falling last fall through the winter, we took advantage of that and shifted more coal into gas, and we continue to do that through the summer months. And also, we're still waiting on the EPA to issue the Boiler MACT rules to see where that's going to take us on any further changes. Flexibility-wise, we've maintained the flexibility with the work that was done on the boilers at Counce and Valdosta. We've maintained and built in further flexible capabilities. And so in that regard, it's still very important to us.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Super. And just one last question. You talked about recycled fiber. I assume that your virgin fiber costs overall have been pretty flat. Are you getting any helping from this pickup in lumber?","Mark W. Kowlzan","We started seeing some of this last year in the fall. Again, in particular, as an example, in Michigan area, we saw some increased chips available on the market for some hardwood sawmills. So in that regard, we've seen some benefit. Obviously, we're not where we were prior to the housing collapse, but we've seen a little bit of improvement.","Operator","Our next question comes from Philip Ng of Jefferies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Thanks for the color on your raw material prices. I think you commented that OCC is going to be down, energy and chemical is going to be up sequentially. So collectively, should we expect input cost to be up sequentially?","Richard B. West","What we said, is the -- in fact, lower mill cost overall compared to the second quarter and the third quarter, Philip, embedded within that number is some increases for electricity a little bit and also some in chemicals, primarily starch, but overall, still lower.","Mark W. Kowlzan","What you see take place typically in the July, August period in some of the areas with the summer heat and temperatures, the utilities end up having to have some abnormally high real-time pricing. And so we just expect that there will be some days and some periods where we see some real-time pricing get out of hand.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I got you. But it didn't sound like it's going to be a sharp uptick from where you were at...","Mark W. Kowlzan","It's something we typically see, but we just -- we made that point.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then I just want to get a little more color on what you're seeing on the export market right now. I think you did comment that things were a little better than you expected both from a demand and pricing standpoint. Certainly, the headline out of Europe and Brazil have gotten worse. I just want to get your view on a real-time basis.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Phil, I'll just comment on that real quick. I mean, it's -- sometimes, we're not the best barometer of the export market quite frankly because we send a lot of specialty products to that export market in terms of liner, but it's not great over in Europe. But I don't think it's as disastrous as what the press would have you believe.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then during the quarter, you guys obviously shifted out of the export market. How much of that was just the downtime you guys were taking or just better integration on the box side from the acquisitions or you're just taking share? I just want to get a little color on that front. And should that -- will that trend reverse itself in Q3?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Well, again, all of the above. With the downtime that was being planned with the mills and the work that Tom had done with the acquisitions and the organic growth, we needed all of those tons to take care of our customer base here in North America.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And just one last question. I mean, your free cash flow was obviously quite strong, kind of like pretty nicely this year. When we think about maybe 2013, are there any major reinvestment projects in the horizon or should we expect it to be pretty much in line from 2012? So would the majority of that cash be returned to shareholders and acquisitions?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Well, again, we'll continue to look at box plant acquisition opportunities and strategic opportunities from the organic side as we see customers growing and their needs, demanding we can work with them. So that's something we hope that will continue. That's what we're planning on.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. But nothing like what we've seen in the last few years. Is that fair?","Mark W. Kowlzan","No -- that's fair. Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Gaffner of Barclays.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So you mentioned the lower energy cost was a $0.05 benefit in the quarter, and you talked about some of that coming just from lower fuel costs and then somewhat from the energy projects you completed. Can you just sort of break that down so we can get a sense of how much is coming from each of those buckets?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Well, the -- again, the energy projects have been contributing the bulk of that. So we continue to see good results from both the Counce and Valdosta piece. And so again -- so that's pretty much the -- all that savings contributed through the Counce and Valdosta projects. And probably, Valdosta is a little bigger contributor than Counce. Just to put a little technicolor on it, at our Valdosta mill, if you count the -- that was a boiler project. We still -- and we buy no -- basically, no purchased fuel at Valdosta. We run on 100% wood waste from our own wood yard and black liquor. And so no purchased fuel, and we buy very little electricity, we produce roughly 98% of our own electricity. And then we have byproducts that come out of burning black liquor, things like tall oil soap and turpentine. You throw that all together and our energy cost at Valdosta is actually a negative number. And that's obviously a big source of the savings.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And so are you returning energy to the grid through Valdosta? Is that...","Mark W. Kowlzan","On occasion, we sell some back to the grid, but most of the time, we run at about 80% -- about 98% of what we need. And we buy a little from the grid to maintain the utility tie in case there was ever an emergency. And we had to take that -- but we had to take the turbine down.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And also in the quarter, your maintenance cost came in at only -- you said $0.02 maintenance cost for the quarter. I think you were saying there was going to be a $0.03 headwind going into the quarter. Is that -- were you able to outperform on some of the projects? Where did those lower costs come from?","Richard B. West","The change from 1Q to 2Q was the accounting of the annual outage costs. From the standpoint compared to last year, in the second quarter, we were $0.02 per share better, and that's more driven by the fact that we're -- especially the energy project, we're not having to repair such older equipment. We've got new equipment -- new boiler at Valdosta and rebuilt boilers at Counce, which really helps us. So the majority of the $0.02 per share improvement year-over-year was related to the energy project.","Mark W. Kowlzan","And Rick raises a very good point. When we did this project, we noted that over a 5-, 6-year period, we would reduce maintenance on those 5 old boilers that we took out of service by about $80 million in terms of cost avoidance. Now some of that is capitalized and some of it is expense, but with $80 million in additional to the savings that we got, that we don't have to spend as Rick just pointed out. And that's an important point.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, you mentioned e-commerce is now benefiting the December month. But do you get any benefit from e-commerce in back-to-school sales? And maybe you could just also talk about your overall thoughts on e-commerce and how that could potentially aid the overall industry as we move forward.","Paul T. Stecko","I think year-round though, e-commerce is a positive factor. I think, again, seasonally, whether it's school-related time of the year, that's definitely been a positive for the industry.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Yes, and December is especially strong for 2 reasons: one, that's obviously the biggest buying period for things, and people are shopping more and more on the Internet; and the other beauty of buying things on the Internet as opposed to a store, when you have to send it back to the Internet, you got to pack it in another box to send it back because most of the time, you throw the first box away. So you get a double bang for your buck over the Christmas holiday.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And do you have any preference of those boxes versus your traditional boxes? Is that...","Mark W. Kowlzan","Well, I think you got to look at that. That volume is good for the entire industry. Where it ends up benefits everybody. And it doesn't matter who makes it, that's going into volume for the industry. And those kind of boxes tend to be lower priced. There are plenty of brown boxes, don't have a lot of graphics on. So that's not the sweet spot of our mix, but it benefits the industry in terms of total consumption.","Operator","Our next question comes from Al Kabili of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess first question on inventory, down, I think, 1,000 tons sequentially. Can you just comment how you're feeling about your inventories right now, how they are versus where you want them ideally?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Well, we're basically on plan, but again, we are going into a busy time of the year for us. So we need every ton we have, and that's important. I mean, the mills have to run right now. It's critical, we've got now all the shutdown -- heavy shutdown period, which is the second quarter. And we basically held where we wanted to on-plan with inventories. But again, we need the tons and we've got the business and we've got to run.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. The other question I had, just around -- just the tone of the market. I mean, I know you're outperforming the industry, but I was wondering maybe if you could just help us with -- if there's any notable changes with what you're seeing now, with what it was like this time last year. Has there been any differences in terms of what you're seeing in the environment, et cetera, notable differences, say, versus this time last year?","Mark W. Kowlzan","From our perspective, there's not much of a change. We've taken advantage of what we built into the box plant system and mill system. And again, Tom's group is taking advantage of that with the customer base and working with them, and the results speak for themselves.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then final question is on mix. You highlighted earlier that you did a little better from a mix perspective this quarter than you initially anticipated. Sequentially, can you help us with how you're thinking about mix sequentially?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Our mix will be pretty similar to what it is in the past going forward. We may see -- as I mentioned earlier, we probably will see a slight pickup on the graphics side of the business going forward just because I think we've got customers that are trying very hard to feature their products in a relatively flat market.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joshua Zaret of Longbow Research.","Joshua L. Zaret - Longbow Research LLC","I have one question. I guess the thing that caught my interest was, you mentioned you're doing strategic spending on 5 box plants. Now I think, and correct me, you have about 70 box plants. So the question is, a, are there -- is this something that's going to be ongoing? And b, what is the focus of this spending? Are you adding -- is there a need for more corrugated at some of these plants or are you changing markets? So if you could answer those questions, I'd be very interested. And how much capital you'll be investing over time? You mentioned the amount of -- you're investing for your acquisition. I assume this is small, but I'd like to know that.","Mark W. Kowlzan","That was in reference to the spending that was done in 2010 and 2011 with the 5 box plants we had identified. We spent $80 million during those 2 years on the strategic opportunities. Now the point that was made, we will continue as we go forward. As we're working with our customer base, if we have the opportunity to grow with them and we see an opportunity, we might make some strategic investments.","Joshua L. Zaret - Longbow Research LLC","So is this about scale, basically?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","Joshua, this is Tom here. I just want to point out that I think it's very important to understand, we have never, never invested capital on a \"build it and they will come\" basis. I mean, our capital is always strategically invested around our customers and around demand that we see in particular marketplaces. That, we will continue to do.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Yes, and to amplify on that, we did that with the $80 million we spent. We're into that, we like the results, they're showing up in our numbers, bottom line. And as we go forward, we now have more competition with internal projects because of that success versus acquisitions. So in order to make an acquisition, this money has got to compete against internal projects, and our success in the last few years on internal projects has been very good. And so the competition for that last dollar of capital is even more keen within the company than it has been in the past, and that's the point we've been trying to make. So we got -- we've had good choices. We can't make them all, but it's good to have a more good choices than fewer good choices.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Ovshey of Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","On the export front, can you comment what percentage of your volumes went into the export market during the quarter and longer term, whether you see a strategic rationale to be a player in the export market?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Yes. Typically, we've said this -- quarter-to-quarter. In terms of year-to-year, we might go from 8% to 10%, 11% of our products go offshore. And our trend is down in that regard. That's an historical number 8% to 10%, and we've cut back a fair amount from that number, which we're not going to divulge.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Any incremental color you can give on just the mill net differential right now between selling to Europe and then selling domestically. The data seems to imply it's about $100 a ton. Is that a good ballpark figure to be thinking about?","Mark W. Kowlzan","We're not going to comment on this.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Understood. And last question, just on the chemical side. Can you comment on what you saw in terms of pricing trends, for the key chemical costs that you use in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis and what the outlook is going forward for the balance of the year?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Well, again, we saw an easing on the inflationary pressure from last year. But going forward, on the commentary about chemicals into the third quarter, most things are flat. We are anticipating -- as an example, corn, obviously is going to be under pressure, theoretically with what's happening with the drought. So that's one example.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just remind us, what are the key chemical input: starch, caustic, any other big ones we should be thinking about?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Well, again, right now, on the box plant side, the starch and starch-related products, all the adhesives. But on the mill side, obviously, the caustic chemicals and then wood fiber obviously is the big one, which has been very stable.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Mr. Kowlzan, I see there are no more questions. Do you have any closing comments?","Mark W. Kowlzan","I'd like to thank you everybody for participating today, and we look forward to seeing everybody on the next call. Have a good day. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference for today. You may all disconnect, and have a wonderful day."],"16942":["Packaging Corporation of America (NYSE:PKG) Q4 2015 Results Earnings Conference Call January 26, 2016  9:45 AM ET","Executives","Mark Kowlzan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thomas Hassfurther - Executive Vice President, Corrugated Products","Robert Mundy - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets","Mark Connelly - CLSA","George Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Debbie Jones - Deutsche Bank","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup","Philip Ng - Jefferies","Christopher Manuel - Wells Fargo","Steve Chercover - D.A.

Your host today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chief Executive Officer of PCA. Upon conclusion of his narrative, there will be a Q&A session.","I will now turn the conference call over to Mr. Kowlzan, and please proceed when you are ready.","Mark Kowlzan","Good morning, and thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's fourth quarter and full year earnings release conference call. I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA and with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs our Packaging business and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer.","During our prepared comments, we will be referring to slides that are posted on our website. I'll begin the call with a review of the fourth quarter and full year results and then I am going to turn the call over to Tom and Bob who'll provide more details. I'll wrap things up, and then we'll be glad to take questions.","Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter net income of $104 million or $1.07 per share. Fourth quarter net income included net nonrecurring charges primarily from the Boise integration of about $400,000. Excluding these special items, fourth quarter 2015 net income was $105 million or $1.08 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 net income of $114 million or $1.16 per share. Fourth quarter net sales were $1.4 billion in both 2015 and 2014.","We also recorded full year earnings excluding earning special items of $443 million or $4.53 per share compared to 2014 earnings excluding special items of $459 million or $4.66 per share.","Net sales in 2015 were $5.74 billion compared to the $5.85 billion in 2014. Excluding special items total company EBITDA in 2015 was $1.106 billion compared to $1.144 billion in 2014. Details of the special items for both fourth quarter and full year 2015 were included in the schedule that accompanies the earnings press release.","Turning to slide 3, fourth quarter 2015 earnings per share excluding special items were $0.08 per share below the fourth quarter of 2014 driven primarily by lower white paper prices and mix of $0.10, higher annual mill outage costs $0.03, lower corrugated volume $0.02, lower containerboard production $0.02, lower export containerboard prices $0.02 and higher depreciation expense $0.02. These items were partially offset by lower costs for energy of $0.05, mill repair costs $0.03 and freight $0.02) as well as our lower income taxes of $0.04) per share. Our earnings were $0.05 per share better than our fourth quarter guidance.","Operational performance contributed about $0.06 per share in total which included about $0.02 for energy, $0.02 for mill repair costs, $0.01 for wood and $0.01 for chemicals. Also as we continue to optimize logistics our freight was $0.02 better than forecast and our tax rate was also $0.02 better. These items were more than offset however by lower than forecast containerboard production and box volumes of about $0.04 per share.","Looking at our packaging business, EBITDA margins excluding special items were up over last year's levels with EBITDA of $252 million and sales of $1.09 billion were 23.1% margins compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 packaging EBITDA excluding special items of $250 million on sales of $1.1 billion or a 22.3% margin.","For the full year excluding special items packaging EBITDA was $1.009 billion with sales of $4.48 billion or 22.5% margin compared to full year 2014 EBITDA of $1.015 billion with sales of $4.54 billion or 22.4% margin.","During the quarter our containerboard mills operated in a very cost effective manner. Containerboard production was 903,000 tons which was a 24,000 tons decrease compared to last year's fourth quarter as we ramped the demand and unlike last year's fourth quarter we did not need to pre-build any inventory for our first quarter 2016 maintenance outage.","As a result we reduced containerboard inventory about 2,500 from the end of September and year-end inventory was flat with 2014 year-end levels.","And now I'm going to turn it over to Tom who will provide more details on containerboard sales and our corrugated business.","Thomas Hassfurther","Thank you, Mark. As Mark indicated, our corrugated products demand was lower than expected during the quarter down 1% in total and per work day compared to last year's record fourth quarter and up 1% for the full year. Pricing for corrugated products during the quarter remained stable compared to the third quarter of 2015 and the fourth quarter of 2014. As expected, mix was seasonably weaker in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter.","Our outside sales in containerboard were flat with the third quarter and up about 7000 tons compared to last year's fourth quarter. For the full year outside containerboard sales were up 52,000 tons over 2014. Export prices were about 2% lower than the third quarter and about 6% lower than last year's fourth quarter levels. Domestic prices for linerboard were flat with the third quarter and last year's fourth quarter. Domestic prices were medium or flat for the third quarter and lower than last year's fourth quarter due to published medium price changes.","I will now turn it back to Mark.","Mark Kowlzan","Thanks Thomas. Looking at our Paper segment, EBITDA and sales were lower compared to the fourth quarter of last year with EBITDA of $28 million and sales of $273 million or 10.3% margins compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 with EBITDA excluding special items of $45 million and sales of $284 million or $15.8% margins.","As we mentioned on our third quarter earnings call, our Jackson, Alabama mill was down for an extended period for a planned rebuild of the recovery boiler which reduced production by 20,000 tons and increased operating costs.","The drop in revenues versus last year's fourth quarter was driven by lower prices and mix as total shipments were 5000 and above last year's levels. Office paper shipments which represent about 70% of our total paper volume were up 4% versus last year. Prices held up very well and as we indicated on our last earnings call, volumes were seasonally lower versus the third quarter. Overall, the white paper mills had good cost control during the quarter and the rebuild of the Jackson Mill recovery boiler was successful.","For the year white paper 2015 EBITDA excluding special items was $161 million and sales were $1.14 billion or 14.1% margins compared to full year 2014 EBITDA of $186 million with sales of $1.2 billion or 15.5% margin.","Office paper shipments improved 1.1% versus full year 2014 and although sales prices and mix negatively impacted our EBITDA by 31% we were able to cut that impact by over half through our cost reduction, efficiency and mix improvement efforts.","And now I'll turn it over to Bob Mundy.","Robert Mundy","Thanks Mark. If you turn to slide 4, will be our cash provided by operations in the fourth quarter was $221 million after deducting $75 million in cash tax payments for federal and state income taxes. Other uses of cash included capital expenditures of $97 million, common stock dividends of $54 million, share repurchases of $57 million, and debt repayments of $17 million. We ended the quarter with $184 million cash on hand.","Our fourth quarter 2015 effective tax rate of 32% was about 2% below last year's fourth quarter related primarily to state rate reductions that we were able to achieve compared to our estimates filed in the fourth quarter of 2014 and it was 3% below the third quarter of 2015 primarily due to the passage of the tax extenders act just prior to the end of the year.","For the full year cash from operations was a record $763 million and free cash flow was also a record $448 million. Our key uses of cash for the year included capital expenditures of $315 million, common stock dividends of $201 million, we repurchased 2.3 million shares for a total of about $155 million and we had debt repayments for the year totaling $48 million.","As we normally do at the beginning of each year PCA derives estimates of certain items for the upcoming year. Capital expenditures we expect to be between $250 million to $265 million, DD&A is expected to be about $352 million or about $5 million higher than 2015 recurring DD&A, pension expense estimated to be $27 million, $5 million below 2015 primarily due to our adopting of the spot rate approach or 16 [ph] versus the single discount rate approach for calculating expense.","We expect to make cash pension payments of $37 million in our by [ph] federal and state effective tax rate for 2016 is expected to be about 35%. Based on our current long term debt with current LIBOR rates interest expense in 2016 would be about $91 million and cash interest payments would be about $84 million.","Regarding the current planned annual maintenance outages at our mills, the total earnings impact of these outages which includes lost production, direct costs and amortized repair costs is expected to be $0.49 per share the current estimated impact by quarter in 2016 is $0.07 in the first quarter, $0.16 in the second, $0.10 in the third quarter and $0.16 per share in the fourth quarter.","Now I'll turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Kowlzan","Thanks Bob. In summary, 2015 was a very successful year for PCA as we completed the integration of Boise and achieved full design capacity of our converted DeRidder Louisiana number 3 paper machine. The significant part of the integration effort was related to the rationalization and optimization of the Boise legacy broad [indiscernible] system as well as optimizing the product mix, freight and warehousing logistics of our containerboard system.","Regarding synergies, we achieved on run rate basis a $200 million target and finally we achieved record cash from operations and record free cash flow in 2015.","Looking ahead for the first quarter we have scheduled maintenance outages at our Valdosta mill, one of our machines in [indiscernible] mill and one machine at the DeRidder mill. Labor benefit costs will be higher with annual wage increases and other timing related expenses and seasonally colder weather will increase wood and energy costs. Our tax rate will also be higher in the first quarter. These items will be partially offset by slightly higher containerboard production and corrugated product shipments and lower scheduled outage costs.","Finally over the weekend Pulp and Paper Week, a trade publication, lowered its published price for domestic linerboard and medium by $15 and $20 per ton, respectively, which will adversely affect earnings. Everything considered, we currently expect first quarter earnings of $1.00 per share.","With that, we'd be happy then to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constitute as forward-looking statements. The statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements.","And with that operator, I would like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Your first question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.","Mark Kowlzan","Good morning, Mark","Mark Weintraub","Thank you, good morning Mark. First, two questions if I could first one being just quickly, could you give us a sense as to what was happening to demand and volumes as the quarter progression? You noted that fourth quarter is a little weaker than you had anticipated, was that towards the end of the year or was that towards the beginning of the quarter?","And then second, if perhaps we could just get a little bit more detail on the bridge from 4Q to 1Q, I imagine that the adverse price maybe is $0.02 or something like that, but what are the other bigger elements if you could sort of size them first a little bit that would be really helpful? Thanks.","Mark Kowlzan","Yes Mark, let me start off with the volume discussions. Your question regarding how did the quarter go, we indicated our first 10 days were flat with the third quarter, what we saw happening by the latter half of October we saw some decline that we had not expected that continued into the early part of November and then through that mid-November Thanksgiving holiday we saw the volume picked back up and it was a rather nice recovery and so again there was again a sustained recovery through the latter half of the quarter. And also I think Tom can add a little color to that, the quarter itself and obviously the volume was what we expected, but again there was a lot of moving parts taking place as I mentioned on the script with the rationalization and optimization effort. Tom?","Thomas Hassfurther","Yes Mark, I will just add to that. We did take out some pretty significant volume and facilities quite frankly regarding the Boise legacy business, specifically the Tharco business which quite frankly just did not fit our model from a margin standpoint or from a long term strategy standpoint. So we went through a lot of that in the fourth quarter, got that behind us. As Mark indicated, the volumes tailed off in the second half of October and in early November that picked up quite significantly all the way through the end of December going into January. So that kind of gives you an idea where the trouble was.","Mark Kowlzan","And then regarding the bridge Bob we'll ask you that bridge question.","Robert Mundy","Yes Mark, you had indicated what you either thought that I guess the price impact of your small number I think we'd agree is it is something that we don\u2019t see that being very large for the first quarter. The other items, seasonal items like dependent [ph] with weather and those types of things, energy and wood I think you would normally expect is what are some of the timing items which those timing items a lot around late labor type things, wages type things like [indiscernible] we said at the beginning of the year that stared up staying with us throughout the year but they are heavy in that first quarter.","And then just we'll have some timing things just from a [indiscernible] perspective, the freeze in the mills, repairs and materials things that you usually starting into the year we getting on to new initiatives and what not. So those are some of timing thing to that sort of fits that at the beginning of the year. So those would be some of the bigger items both in the fourth quarter and the first quarter.","Mark Kowlzan","Next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.","Chip Dillon","Sorry, good morning. I guess one quick sort of clean up question is, did you \u2013 do you have a good idea Bob of what the deferred tax will be or I'll say it differently, how the cash tax rate might defer from the book tax rate in 2016?","Robert Mundy","It is about 1% difference. There were about - there was about 1% difference between the two. It is I think the tax, the tax rate is 35.29 just over 36.","Chip Dillon","Got you and did you say what the year-end 2015 debt was again?","Robert Mundy","Year-end 2015 debt was or net debt was about $2.1 billion in regards with cash at 184.","Chip Dillon","Okay got you, so the debt was 2284 [ph] then?","Robert Mundy","The debt was 2309 less the cash of 184 so the net is 21.25.","Got you, okay and then you mentioned the Pulp and Paper Weak adjustment over the weekend, I guess two questions, how does that flow into your box prices? In other words is there more of an impact we should expect in the second quarter which I guess it would be a lag? And maybe talk a little bit about how much of your business is affected by it? And then lastly, would you at least on the kraft linerboard side was there any surprise to you in that move?","Mark Kowlzan","Let me start off with that and I am going to hand it over to Tom. Obviously it took us all by surprise and we're not going to quantify the impact, but still trying to analyze the total impact, it is in our guidance, but again there are very strategic points that take place for pricing and where we have upwards of 15,000 customers everybody is different in terms of how the sales [ph] take place. But Tom why don\u2019t you add a little color to this?","Thomas Hassfurther","Okay, yes Chip, I hope you could understand that I mean basically when it comes to discussing the lags or how much the impact is with our customers and things like that, I mean those are contracts we've been having with our customers, that's the only people we really discuss that with. So it is hard to add any real color to that. And as Mark indicated we're still sorting through it to some extent. But nonetheless, I mean just top paper mill of course came out to be a great surprise I think, yes big one.","And keep in mind as the first line of work increase that we've seen since 2005 [ph] now just hearing some of my takes on it and what I think is perhaps going on, but one is the large decline in the sites of the open market has made it much harder I think for trade publications to assess what's really happening. I think that, you know, you basically then cited a move in the traction of the market associated with a small reach and then broad rest that across the entire country and translate that into linerboard pricing, kraft linerboard pricing specifically. So, I can speak for PCA, we\u2019ve not seen any changes in kraft linerboard and so we are very different than most of our favorite supporters.","Now they did give some specific pricing associated with recycle linerboard and apparently use that as further rationale to take down kraft linerboard prices and of course that\u2019s bothersome because they know that there is a big difference between recycled and kraft and are essentially two different products when it comes to linerboard.","So, it seems that they are heavily influenced by this pricing of recycle linerboard and try to translate that into lowering kraft linerboard across the board. So that\u2019s pretty much the extent my comments at this point I can assure you will continue to assess and monitor things going forward.","Chip Dillon","Thank you, that\u2019s very helpful and I guess the last quick one is and I know it's very early days, but you mentioned a great point in time about the very limited open market that\u2019s out there and so obviously that makes it a big challenge to - for anyone to sort of gauge where that is, it's really about boxes and in that vein were they being taught maybe changing at least to help PCA might index their pricing of boxes to something else that's more broad that is very easy to observe like fiber costs or maybe even the \u2013 like the PPI?","Thomas Hassfurther","Chip, you know, we've had the discussion before, they're back already last number of years, obviously they have said something we don\u2019t want to get into on the call. It is complex and it is not straightforward as some people might think it is. So obviously there are different ways, but again this is something that right, wrong or different. The market has changed so that's all I want to comment on.","Chip Dillon","Okay, that\u2019s all very helpful. Thank you.","Mark Kowlzan","Next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays.","Scott Gaffner","Thanks, good morning.","Mark Kowlzan","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Gaffner","I just was wondering, could you talk a little bit, Tom I think you mentioned you walked away from some of that Tharco business, it sounded like that was in the fourth quarter. If so, it was just margin issue with the Tharco business and so should be feeling the effects of that throughout 2016?","Thomas Hassfurther","Well Scott, I mean I\u2019m not going to get into great details about that business, but obviously, you know that\u2019s primarily a distribution business and as I said it dented our market models, nor did it did our long terms strategies. It is - some of it is significantly different than the way we go to market and so we are therefore some of that business was not a fit. I'm not saying all of it, I'm just saying some of it you much take into case.","But I mean in addition I mean if you look at our volume, I mean one of the other reasons that the volume was awesome what it is that, I don\u2019t think we've got the economic tailwinds that we had started in the fourth quarter. GDP numbers suggested the economy grew only about half a percent and the last two months of the ISM data [ph] indicates the manufacturing activity may have contracted for the first times since 2011 during our fourth quarter.","So, I think that\u2019s and I think some of that\u2019s clearly due to the strong dollar that\u2019s impacting exports and we\u2019re getting some of that from our customers as well. So, I think that we\u2019ve got this Boise legacy business that we have adjusted somewhat behind us now and will allow us to focus on the things that we do best at PCA and get back to growing our business like we expected.","Robert Mundy","I think that's simple metrics Scott, if you look at the year-over-year margin contribution from Tom's side of the business it speaks for itself in terms of what this rationalization effort has contributed and so again, as Tom just lastly mentioned we needed a little more economic tailwind to boost that.","Scott Gaffner","Understood and then just following up on the commentary before, you mentioned during the quarter you saw some acceleration in demand, I think you said late in the quarter. Has that carried forward so far in the 1Q or is that are we back to more November like numbers?","Mark Kowlzan","Tom has got the data for the first 13 days of the month.","Thomas Hassfurther","Yes, the first 13 days of bookings billings are flat with last year\u2019s January which was a very robust year, pretty robust month I should say up 4.1%. So I would say that the demand pick up that we had in December has carried over to January.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. ","Thomas Hassfurther","We were very pleased that right through the holiday weeks the volume was very good.","Scott Gaffner","All right and then just lastly on the outside sales I think you said you had an increase in outside sales during the quarter, was that to the export market or something domestic?","Thomas Hassfurther","Both went up a little bit.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Mark Kowlzan","Okay. Next question?","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets.","Mark Wilde","Good morning.","Mark Kowlzan","Good morning, Mark.","Mark Wilde","Couple of questions, Tom with output and two finer points on this, would it be fair to say that if we backed out the Tharco \u2013 shutting of the Tharco volume that your corrugated volume would have been at or above the industry numbers?","Thomas Hassfurther","I\u2019m not going to get into that detail Mark, you could just you know, but you can do the math I think that, you're not overall [ph] telling [ph].","Mark Wilde","Yes, okay. And then the other question I had Mark Kowlzan, if you could give us any color on the duties on uncoated freesheet imports and whether that has changed anything and kind of where you see the market moving in the first half of the year?","Mark Kowlzan","You know the post data shows a significant reduction in imports starting in the third quarter which is after the preliminary rulings were issued. The imports were down around 200,000 tons in 2015 and most of the decline was in fact in the second half of the year as we previously mentioned and we do have some customers that are buying imported paper. We know that many of them bought additional inventory earlier in the year before the rulings came out.","So typical market dynamics were in play and it\u2019s a little bit too early to tell, but it is very obvious that the trade case has significantly slowed the imports and which is really just creating a level playing field. But I think you see that in our volumes, again one indicator, I think our total paper volume for January were up 3% and so we had finished the year strong in paper volumes and going through the first three weeks of January. So again, I think the trade case is having a positive impact.","Mark Wilde","Okay. And then finally if I could Bob Mundy, can you just give us an update on sort of what is still sitting up there on share repurchase authorization and how you\u2019re thinking about sort of use of cash this year particularly in light of the big drop we\u2019ve seen in the stocks in recent weeks?","Robert Mundy","Yes, yes, Mark it is about 93 million remaining of the authorization. So anyhow then our use of cash as we talked maybe a little bit of color as to where we see some of that for 2016 and I think it\u2019s Mark will sort of comment on share repurchases, I think our strategy of continuing to be opportunistic will continue. Of course CapEx as I indicated was and Mark had said in the last quarter\u2019s call that we expected it to be down versus 2015 because of lot of the heavy lifting behind us and so that\u2019s \u2013 that obviously is high as it was in 2015.","Mark Kowlzan","Anything else Mark?","Mark Wilde","I think that\u2019s it. I will turn it over.","Mark Kowlzan","Okay, thank you. Next question?","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.","Mark Kowlzan","Good morning.","Mark Connelly","Mark, your stock got selected yesterday pretty much in line with everybody else, but your business model in the past has tended to outperform somewhat. Do you think your business model is less able to outperform at this point or are the internal opportunities less attractive?","Mark Kowlzan","You have heard us talk about rationalization. Our priority in 2015 was completing the two-year integration of Boise and executing well on that. And so, a big piece of that as we\u2019ve indicated was this rationalization and the readjustment of the entire Boise legacy box system and so in doing so we concentrated on that. As you think about it, we haven\u2019t made any acquisitions of box plants. The last one was in April of 2014.","And so, we\u2019re right now through this last era we've purely been on organic growth mode. We\u2019ve been avoiding over extending ourselves and so recapping right now where we are we\u2019re poised for growth. If you go back to the 2012, 2013 period we are open market buyers. We had integrated up into the low 90s and we had \u2013 we've gone through roughly five acquisitions of box plants. We built a new plant in Redding, but a new plant in the [indiscernible] and so we have a lot of the acquisition and organic capability.","And so, we have reset the stage for that. We\u2019ve got the containerboard ton for Tom, we\u2019ve got the acquisition integrations done. All the work that Tom did on the legacy Boise Tharco system is behind us. So I think again, the model remains very strong and relevant and so that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to plan to execute on. Again we have got the balance sheet and we\u2019ve got the tons to move into the market as we seek that.","Mark Connelly","So would it be fair to say that we should expect you to be more aggressive on upping your integration levels now?","Mark Kowlzan","Well that's \u2013 we talked about that on some calls last year that the goal will be to move back up into the low 90s and we\u2019ll do that with a combination of designed box plant acquisitions and organic growth and so be mindful on the acquisition side looking at the quality and the multiple paying, but again we are looking at that, we are ready and capable of executing on that.","Mark Connelly","Super, thank you.","Mark Kowlzan","Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George Staphos","Hi everyone, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Most of them have already asked and answered. I guess maybe Mark a question for you or maybe it is probably more for an economist. I mean you mentioned that ISM [ph] got progressively more negative in the back portion of the quarter. You saw volumes for your business pick up as we approached quarter end.","How do you reconcile that and should we be worried if at all that what we saw in the last two months in terms of macro data doesn\u2019t translate to your business in the first quarter? And then the related question I had, the rationalization effect of primarily the Tharco business, how long will that be a headwind for you, will it be more or less if maybe not line item in details visible in terms of your overall growth rate through the third quarter of this year, does it continue all the way into the fourth quarter, do you feel you have most of it behind you where and lot of it had been done already in the first quarter of 2015?","Mark Kowlzan","On the first question regarding the economy in the ISM [ph] obviously the last reported ISM data showed a contraction. What we think was happening or what we have to believe happened as the Holiday period came on Internet commerce have reported in the various segments was very strong and so I think we were a player in the Internet commerce, but that also plays into the fact that we said that mix was not enriched as we expected. And so, I think that is a large portion of what you see.","Regarding any overhang and impacts of the integration and rationalization of the Tharco business, I think again we need the economy to give us some tailwind. With that being said, Tom and the group of fully prepared and focused now on rolling that business instead of just how they go about rationalizing. Tom, do you want to add some color to that?","Thomas Hassfurther","Yes, I would just add George. The ISM [ph] numbers tend to be somewhat of a trailing number also. So the way we go to market is fast as you know people - boxes and trends we see are kind of leading edge as opposed to maybe the ISM the import trailing edge. I would say the ISM data probably ended up showing what we saw in October, but probably hasn\u2019t come out really to represent what happened at the end of November or December or through December I should say.","So and the rationalization effect of Tharco of course whenever you \u2013 whenever you eliminate something or sort of resize something and you\u2019re going to be dealing with that certainly going forward, but that\u2019s said, I mean it\u2019s totally behind us now, were not in terms of comparing numbers, month-over-month or quarter-over-quarter, but we\u2019re very poised now to move forward and have gotten all those efforts behind us which were important to us, we'll be back to operating like PCA.","George Staphos","Okay and thanks for that Tom. A related question perhaps and my sense is what you think you saw in the fourth quarter was more inventory contraction and then hopefully more of a back to normal approach from your customers, but I don\u2019t want to put words, is that what you think you saw and then related question.","Have you seen your bad debts move up at all is there anything in your data right now that is suggesting whatever we've been going through both within the sector and broad economy is the fun edge of a recession or do you think it is more inventory contraction. We're back to normal at this juncture.","Thomas Hassfurther","Let me, yes, on the bad debt piece of that, we have actually see bad debt losses on the bad debt piece of that, we\u2019ve actually seen our bad debt losses actually declined and so that\u2019s been very favorable for us.","Robert Mundy","And then on the, the question about the economy and we said this before, our customer base being two thirds local accounts, they\u2019re very nimble and they are very capable of responding very quickly and I think Tom said I think they were some response from our \u2013 lower customer base to as the economy in the news, the daily news that we saw every morning as we watched first business news and people got cautious and probably ran some of their volume inventories lower levels. But that being said they can respond on the partner side just flip these up.","Thomas Hassfurther","I don\u2019t want to try to qualify or quantify.","Mark Kowlzan","George, I'll agree with that and what we\u2019ve seen over the last few years quite frankly, this is something that just recently. We've been seeing that our customer base is very sensitive to inventory levels and our very estimate, quick adjustments and so, its let\u2019s say going into October they were a little less optimistic about the Christmas season or something like that. I mean, they can adjust inventories very quickly, so this is something we see and so it's actually changed the seasonality a little bit of our business as well.","George Staphos","Okay, I appreciate it guys and will turn it over.","Mark Kowlzan","Thanks, next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank.","Debbie Jones","Hi, good morning.","Mark Kowlzan","Good morning.","Debbie Jones","You guys talked you being a player in ecommerce I was just under the impression a lot of this growth is in recycle boxes, maybe that\u2019s not the case and you can correct me, but does this impact your ability to kind of grow with it trend?","Thomas Hassfurther","Debbie this Tom, I\u2019ll handle that. So, I mean, as you can well imagine as the right ecommerce is drawing I mean virtually that, anybody who has got a consumer related process in ecommerce somewhere or other and it is not just all recycled anything. I mean it's still required for performance boxes and it is still required traffic boxes, it requires all sources of things that we currently supply. So no, we don\u2019t feel the least limited in drawing in that region.","Debbie Jones","Okay and then I guess if I move to kind of growth from M&A, how important is this to your strategy, you had mentioned quality in the multiple, but are other things out there that actually fit your criteria?","Thomas Hassfurther","Yes, we continue to explore acquisitions and there are some things that would fit our criteria now it takes two to tango at this side, so we need somebody who is, who wants to sell and at the same time, we're an anxious buyer, so to make this thing work, but nonetheless there are some quality assets out there, fewer than they were before, but I think as Mark indicated earlier we will remain a disciplined acquirer. So we're not changing that part of our strategy.","Debbie Jones","Okay, great. Thanks, I\u2019ll turn it over.","Mark Kowlzan","Thank you. Next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.","Anthony Pettinari","Good morning, thanks for taking my question.","Mark Kowlzan","Good morning.","Anthony Pettinari","You referenced export prices lower sequentially in 4Q and I\u2019m wondering if you could speak to what you are seeing in the beginning of the year in export markets either in terms of pricing with the strong dollar or what underlying demand looks like? And then can you remind us what percentage of you containerboard last year was exported?","Thomas Hassfurther","Okay, Anthony as far as demand goes, I mean demand is pretty flat right now. I mean, again we are relatively small player in the export pocket, so you got to keep that in mind. But we are in numerous regions and you\u2019ve got some that are down, I mean obviously if you take China and then some of the effect in Asia that\u2019s down and then you've got some others that you\u2019re actually back a little bit and then Latin America, South America is relatively flat, so it is pretty flat on an overall basis.","We don\u2019t talk about forward pricing. I gave you some indication of what happened up to this point in packaged pricing, but anything going forward is really between us and our customers. But I will say that obviously the strong dollar is a headwind for us when it comes to that.","Mark Kowlzan","Anthony regarding the export volumes, we are currently just under 10% of our total containerboard volumes going in export, but again, moving that into about 35 different countries worldwide, that\u2019s up from a few years ago when we were open market buyers of containerboard and needed those tons and we shipped all those tons back into our own need. So with DeRidder and their capability we've been able to service some of our legacy customer requirements around the world, but its again small portion less than 10%.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay, that\u2019s helpful and then switching to white papers, the $0.38 headwind you saw last year from lower price mix, in terms of the mix piece of that, is there anything in 2016 between the mix, between office paper pulp, specialty papers that would be a meaningful tailwind or headwind in 2016 in terms of your mix of white paper?","Mark Kowlzan","Again, just elaborating a little bit on the mix, what we saw happening last year, a lot of the, on cut size in particular you saw a lot of it shipped from the high end super bright, Laser Inkjet type cut size into the more commodity type cut size, the 92 bright cut size paper and so that trend continues and it's just the market that we're living in right now. And so, that being said, we are comfortable there and we get our volumes up, so we\u2019re feeling good about that.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over.","Mark Kowlzan","Next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies.","Philip Ng","Hey, good morning guys, I understand PPW cut was largely backward looking and generally appreciate the color you provided earlier, but the market and just a reaction to your stock our investors are actually concerned that there could be further price erosion. Can you just provide any color on pricing in terms of outlook, supply\/demand and just competitive activity in the broader market that would be helpful?","Mark Kowlzan","Again for trust reasons we're not going to get into a discussion about pricing.","Philip Ng","Okay.","Mark Kowlzan","We just cannot go there.","Philip Ng","Can you just talk about supply\/demand and just the competitive active in the marketplace at the start of the year?","Mark Kowlzan","Again, we've commented our volume is in line with where we were last year, we were flat, but again, I think we\u2019ve indicated that we need a better economy, stronger economy as far as some tailwind and so at the end of the day we have a system that can respond. We have a system that\u2019s ready for growth, but Tom you want to add any more color to that?","Thomas Hassfurther","Yes, I would say that, I mean I think you need to think of it like this reaching for the supply standpoint, kraft linerboard standpoint you are talking about, kraft linerboard it really hasn\u2019t grown significantly in years and so, very much in balance and run rates that are probably on average something closer to 94%, 95% which is very healthy and demand that all we can do is, go up what our trends are which we indicated was moved upwards in December period over into January and were now compared to the 4.1% jump we saw January a year ago so.","Those are the best we can tell you in terms of the trends and I think that the, I think there is a lot of industries that would - are very envious of the fact that we've got a 95% run rate in an industry like this based on kraft linerboard price.","Philip Ng","Okay, that\u2019s helpful and I guess obviously there has been a big focus on pricing coming, flipping a little bit here. But on the offset are you seeing any major cost tailwinds with this pullback in energy costs, chemical prices, it did seem like freight was a larger tailwind. Can you kind of help quantify and what the potential net impact would be on margins in 2016?","Mark Kowlzan","Yes, I will let Bob give you a little more color, but obviously through the year last year we did see the benefit of natural gas pricing and so there is a benefit to the lower petroleum input cost factor, and we did as we indicated on calls last year. We are concentrating heavily on the transportation efficiency and capabilities within our system and how we supplied Tom's side of the business from the middle. So we saw that, so Bob do you want to give a little more color?","Robert Mundy","Yes, I would say obviously Mark said was absolutely correct plus on there being that energy side we\u2019re just, Mark talked on the last call about as an example the turbine project we did an international call that we got partial benefit of this year, that will continue for the whole year.","So we see pretty much on all the inputs, nothing really - those favorable trends should continue. One of the reasons in the fourth quarter we did better is because really at I Falls we overcame actually the electrical rate went up as an example, but because we\u2019re purchasing so much less electricity we turned that into a $2 million plus just year-over-year, just a fat mill [ph] problem. So those are types of things that will certainly help us in 2016.","Philip Ng","Okay, this is one last one from me, I mean you guys mentioned that you guys are ready for growth, M&A. You guys have been kind of absent from that market whether it\u2019s the box market or paper. I know valuation hasn\u2019t been an issue or something that is reason why you have been reluctant be as aggressive. I mean given the pullback in valuation across the board has the pipeline kind of improved or how do you seem to have valuation come in as well in as well in the open market? Thanks.","Mark Kowlzan","I don\u2019t think at the current time I don\u2019t think anybody has a real good feel for what these current valuations are. We just know that again compared to historical valuations on box plant acquisitions the multiples had gone up. And at the time as Tom mentioned the number of plants and books of business that were available that we would be interested in were fewer and so we have plenty to do with the integration and optimization effort with Boise. So we were less compelled to go and chase these last year as an example. But that being said, we are looking, we won\u2019t get into what we believe is a fair multiple, when we do something we will let you know.","Philip Ng","Okay. Thank you.","Mark Kowlzan","Next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo.","Christopher Manuel","Good morning gentlemen. Couple of questions for you, one sort of on a volume and then I want to come back to kind of the price cost element a little bit. As you look forward to 2016, I know you already said when you laid out sort of a guide for 1Q that you are anticipating little bit higher volume.","But even kind of thinking about the industry or yourself specifically, however you wish to address it, as you look forward to 2016, I mean we had a point \u2013 point and half of corrugated consumption improvement interesting looking at 2016 with half of it still going to food and bev and ecommerce continued to pick up and extra shipping day this year because of a leap year that is worth half a percent. How do you think on a go forward basis as you assess the economy and what you are seeing and feeling that did you think the industry can enjoy another point, point and a half kind of year?","Mark Kowlzan","Let me start off with that and I will turn it over to Tom. Again if you go back in the last few years for the first time and a long time start to see box demand fall in line in a trend line with GDP growth. That being said, in 2014 the GDP numbers were coming on a lot stronger, economists in general, people in general were pretty bullish as 2014 fourth quarter proceeded. We went into the first quarter of 2015 people were talking about in the 3% GDP range.","Obviously bags [ph] are provided down the GDP numbers themselves fell far below what our earlier expectations. So again that being said, if you believe what we saw happening over the last few years that box demand was much more hopelessly tied to GDP, I think again all things being equal, but from an industry perspective, you got to have an economy that is going to give you that table and Tom you want to\u2026","Thomas Hassfurther","Glad to say, chris we're not economists, don\u2019t spend a lot of time trying to be economist. But we do look what those look their claimed their economist say about us \u2013 about the business going forward and I think it\u2019s fair to say that most of them our consensus would be around 1% to 1.5% growth barring any foreseen circumstances. So I think you\u2019re probably in line with what our expectations are.","Christopher Manuel","That\u2019s helpful and then second question I had, I do get that we look in the publications and we see $15 and $20 of price decrease. But I mean, I also kind of help me think this through with the page after that article finishes up and they list key consumable. So effective cost to produce a ton of kraft linerboard and a ton of kraft medium both of those are down. Our these were 3Q over 3Q numbers and we don\u2019t have all 4Q yet, but they\u2019re down $25 to $30 a ton because of lower fiber energy transportation et cetera.","So seeing - on one hand seeing pricing down a little bit less than what cost of produces would sort of imply that on a per ton basis you\u2019re actually making the same or even more money. Looking at your results and looking at your margins getting a little better might suggest that. Does that seem like an unreasonable way to kind of think about things or I know you said you were surprised to see price come down but considering some of the costs came down as well is that maybe not such a ridiculous thing?","Thomas Hassfurther","I think people are not taking into full appreciation is the labor cost benefits inflation that takes place year-over-year. If you go back the last price increase was 2013, so this would be we\u2019re coming up on three years and yet that would be three full years of a company\u2019s labor cost benefits inflation and that is a significant factor in that cost. So even though we get some tailwind between energy costs, some of the other input costs, you throw medical into that and so that you got a big piece of that people aren\u2019t appreciating.","Christopher Manuel","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Mark Kowlzan","Thank you. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson.","Steve Chercover","Thanks. Good morning everyone.","Mark Kowlzan","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Chercover","Just two quick ones please. One of the rationales over last two years for keeping inventories at high levels has been freight and it sounds like the railroads are now easing, so I\u2019m just wondering if you will revisit the strategy or perhaps the bottleneck in box hasn\u2019t changed it is just on frac sand and other commodities?","Mark Kowlzan","I think we\u2019re seeing some box car availability that we did not see. Obviously, the rates are not as good in some cases that we would like to see. It\u2019s not that the railroads of lower grades necessarily and in some cases some of the full mainline service rail they truly choose not to want to still serve some of locations. So it\u2019s not as easy in a straightforward assumption as you might think.","Our costs are down due to the actions that we took to optimize that the inventory and last year established a higher inventory level. We believe we\u2019re at a level that sustains and balances out and optimizes the transportation piece of the equation. But that being said, that does offer you a little bit of relief in terms of what the rail industry is going through and so a lot has taken place with how we are managing transportation.","But again on the trucking side of the equation there has not been any let up on the regulatory pressures that the trucking industry is facing and so again although more box cars maybe out there available it\u2019s how we utilize them and our work price.","Steve Chercover","The margins have been sufficient to say that you\u2019re being quite rationale. Just last question then, you\u2019re obviously reluctant to discuss price and that\u2019s just fine, is it fair to say you\u2019re sure as heck not talking to issues well?","Mark Kowlzan","No comment on that.","Steve Chercover","All right, thank you very much.","Thomas Hassfurther","Thanks.","Mark Kowlzan","Thank you. Next question, please?","Operator","Okay, your next question comes from the line of Andrew Feinman with Iridian Asset Management.","Andrew Feinman","Good morning. So I would just, first question is CapEx for 2016 I don\u2019t know if you can give a number, but I know you said it would be lower, but how about, can you tell us what it would be in terms of the percent of depreciation and amortization?","Mark Kowlzan","Well, yes let me give you the number and we\u2019re - we commented with, we\u2019re probably going to be targeting that $250 million to $265 million which is down from the $314 million actual, I don\u2019t have the full calculation on part\u2026","Robert Mundy","Yes, I mean that was the number I gave earlier I think indicated that deprecation is going to be about $350 million so..","Mark Kowlzan","Yes, so 75% area, so we\u2019re going back to historical levels and that\u2019s what if you think about last two years 2014 we spent $425 million, last year $314 million, high return opportunities. This year it still be continued discipline to reduce capital. But yet at the $250 million and $265 million level we do reserve the right as Tom comes forward as an example with good acquisition opportunities and\/or good cost reduction, high return opportunity that might get identified in a last box planned from the middle. We would update you on future calls.","Andrew Feinman","Right, so when you say you have exerted the right you are saying that if he has an opportunity you could a little higher.","Mark Kowlzan","Absolutely and as far as uses of cash Andy, if you've taken remember your buyback stock, pay dividends, pay down debt or make some high return acquisitions or high return investments that go right to the bottom line. So, the discipline was instilled for that very purpose to really focus everyone\u2019s detention on where we want to go.","Andrew Feinman","Well, okay thank you for that. So, I \u2013 your stock is down from 80 to right now it's at 49. It was over 80 and so I just wonder how you would get comment on that in terms of whether it presents an opportunity for you I\u2019ll stop with that.","Mark Kowlzan","Well, let me just comment. We purchased 914,000 shares of stock in the fourth quarter and so we\u2019re going to be opportunistic. That being said 2015 was a very strong year. We are only off 2014 is all time record earnings by couple of percent and so earnings were down just couple of percent and yet the stock is down and doing what it is so I don\u2019t understand that rationale totally. So we\u2019re going to keep doing what we do and again we've got strong balance sheet, poised for growth as I said earlier and we\u2019re going to keep doing what we know how to do and what our model tell us works.","And with that operator, I think we\u2019re out of time. So, I think I\u2019d like to just basically end it there and appreciate everybody joining us today and look forward to talking with you on the April call.","Operator","Again, thank you for your participation. This concludes today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect."],"16845":["Packaging of America (NYSE:PKG) Q1 2012 Earnings Call April 18, 2012 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Mark W.

Your host today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chief Executive Officer of PCA. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference call over to Mr. Kowlzan, and please proceed when you are ready.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Good morning, and welcome to Packaging Corp. of America First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. I'm Mark Kowlzan, CEO of PCA. And with me on the call today is Paul Stecko, Executive Chairman of PCA; Tom Hassfurther, who runs our Corrugated business; and Rick West, PCA's Chief Financial Officer. Thanks for participating in this morning's call, and after the presentation, we'll be glad to take any questions.","Yesterday, we reported first quarter net income of $18 million or  $0.18 per share, which included a noncash after-tax charge totaling $23 million or $0.24 per share from an amendment of our 2009 federal income tax return to reallocate gallons between alternative fuel mixture credits and cellulosic biofuel producer credits. This  charge is a reversal of income that was previously reported as a special item and not included in our recurring results and is further detailed in the notes to our consolidated earnings results included as part of the press release.","Excluding this charge, adjusted net income was a first quarter record, $41 million or $0.42 per share compared to the first quarter of 2011 adjusted net income of $39 million or $0.39 per share, which excludes a $2 million or $0.02 per share asset disposal charge.","The increase in adjusted net income was driven by higher containerboard and corrugated products volume of $0.09 per share; lower cost for energy of $0.04 per share; and lower recycled fiber cost of $0.02 per share. These increases were partially offset by lower export containerboard prices of $0.03 per share; and increased cost for depreciation of $0.03 per share; transportation, $0.02 per share; labor costs, $0.02 per share; and also higher interest expense of $0.02 per share.","Net sales were a first quarter record, $671 million, up 7% compared to the first quarter of 2011 net sales of $630 million.","Operationally, our business remains strong throughout the quarter with record corrugated product shipments and record mill production despite having 2 of our mills down for annual maintenance outages. The new recovery boiler and turbine at our Valdosta mill and our 2 rebuilt recovery boilers and new turbine at the Counce mill were instrumental in lowering our energy, chemical and repair cost and also increasing our productivity.","Looking at the specific details of operations, higher mill production and corrugated products volume improved our earnings by $0.09 per share compared to last year's first quarter. Our corrugated shipments were up 8.3%, both on a total and a per-workday basis compared to last year's first quarter. Excluding our 3 box plant acquisitions in 2011, corrugated product shipments were up 5.4%. Outside sales of containerboard, both domestic and export, remains strong, essentially equaling last year's first quarter and just slightly below fourth quarter shipments. All of our mills ran exceptionally well, producing 640,000 tons of containerboard, up 38,000 tons over the first quarter of 2011. This performance was driven by improved productivity, lower annual average downtime and an extra mill production day in February, with leap year. Annual mill outages reduced linerboard production by about 18,000 tons during the quarter. Our mill in Valdosta, Georgia was down for 8 days and the No. 2 machine at Counce, Tennessee was down for 4 days. We ended quarter with our inventories as planned, about 11,000 tons above year-end levels. This level of inventory is required considering our anticipated demand and to offset lower production due to the 3 mill maintenance outage scheduled in the second quarter.","The No. 1 machine at Counce will be down for 5 days. The Tomahawk, Wisconsin medium mill will be down 5 days, and our Filer City, Michigan medium mill will be down for 6 days. In addition to normal planned annual outage work at these mills, a Counce outage in April included the lengthy and extensive overhaul of our 50-megawatt No. 1 turbine generator. This type of inspection and overhaul is performed every 6 years and will take about 16 days to complete. During the turbine generator outage, the mill will purchase additional electricity to support mill operations. We will also have our large C2 power boiler down at Counce for the 16 days to make planned repairs to replace boiler wall panels. We generally make major repairs of this time every 15 years or so. After the No. 1 machine starts up, the mill will run at reduced capacity for about 11 days until the boiler work is completed. ","Compared to the first quarter, the planned annual outage work will result in lower mill production, increased mill shutdown and startup costs, as well as higher amortization of outage repair costs. All in all, we expect lost production due to maintenance outages to be about 25,000 tons in the second quarter compared to 18,000 tons in the first quarter. This will complete all our annual maintenance outages for the year. ","Looking at pricing. Our domestic pricing for containerboard and corrugated products remained essentially flat compared to both the first quarter and fourth quarter of last year. Export containerboard prices declined during the fourth quarter of 2011 but stabilized in January of 2012, and then were essentially flat the remainder of the first quarter.  The lower export pricing reduced earnings by about $0.03 per share. ","With regards to costs, energy costs were down $0.04 per share compared to last year's first quarter, driven by major energy projects at Counce and Valdosta. In fact, our energy cost per ton at Valdosta is now a negative number considering all energy items including purchased fuels, electricity and sales of energy-related byproducts such as tall oil. Lower recycled fiber cost improved earnings by $0.02 per share as industry published prices for old corrugated containers or OCC, excluding delivery costs, were down about $25 per ton in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the first quarter of last year. Although the average price for the first quarter was lower than last year, OCC price did increase in each of the 3 months of the first quarter, and April published prices are about $10 per ton above the first quarter average.","We have seen more moderate inflationary cost pressures than we did last year with the exception of outbound transportation costs, which were up about $0.02 per share compared to last year's first quarter, driven by diesel prices, which increased about 10% on average. Diesel prices also trended higher during the first quarter, and exiting March, were up an additional 5%. We currently expect diesel costs to remain at their elevated levels and possibly even go higher as we move into the summer months, which could result in increased transportation cost. ","Labor and benefit costs were up $0.02 per share over last year as a result of increase in pension costs and normal annual wage increases. Depreciation expense was up $0.03 per share compared to last year's first quarter driven by the completion of our energy projects, corrugated projects strategic capital expenditures and newly acquired box plants.","Interest expense was up $0.02 per share driven by non-capitalization of interest with our energy project completion and higher debt. ","I'm now going to turn it over to Rick West, our CFO, who will give an update on our cash position and biofuel tax credits.","Richard B. West","Thank you, Mark. In the first quarter, PCA generated cash from operations before working capital changes of $98 million. Working capital increased by $63 million driven by about $45 million in beginning-of-the-year payments, including incentive bonuses and our semiannual interest payments on our notes, increased inventory levels and other normal seasonal changes in working capital.","Capital expenditures were $35 million during the quarter. We paid our quarterly common stock dividend of approximately $20 million, and repurchased 781,000 shares of our common stock for about $29.75 per share or $23 million. As of March 31, 2012, our diluted shares outstanding were 97.4 million shares. ","On March 16, 2012, we acquired Packaging Specialists, a corrugated products manufacturer located near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with sales of about $50 million in 2011.","At quarter end, we had $84 million cash on hand, and our total long-term debt, excluding capital leases, is $805 million. During the first quarter, no federal cash tax payments were made and no alternative fuel mixture credits or cellulosic biofuel producer credits were used, as our first federal tax payment is not due until April 15.","With the amendment of our 2009 tax return, we have estimated remaining fuel tax credits totaling $42 million to $144 million. This amendment should also allow us to reduce our 2012 federal cash taxes well below our original estimate of about 20%. The final amount of the available fuel tax credits and the final cash tax rate is contingent upon the conclusion of the IRS audit currently underway.","Finally, we are very pleased to report that our application for an energy investment grant from the U.S. Department of the Treasury for our Valdosta, Georgia energy project was approved. And on April 11, we received $57 million in proceeds.","With that, I will turn it back over to Mark.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Thank you, Rick. Looking ahead, our cost per annual maintenance outages will be greater in second quarter than in the first quarter, with less tons produced and higher amortization of repair cost. This will reduce earnings by about $0.03 per share compared to the first quarter. We also expect slightly higher cost for transportation and recycled fiber. Higher corrugated product shipments and a richer mix are expected as we move into a seasonally stronger period. Energy usage should be lower with normal weather and natural gas cost, particularly in our box plants, will be lower. Considering these items, we expect second quarter earnings of about $0.45 per share. ","With that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on this call constituted forward-looking statements. These statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company, and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. ","With that, operator, we'd be glad to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] I am showing our first question comes from Chip Dillon from Vertical Research.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about the thoughts behind switching -- reversing, if you will, looks like roughly almost half of the cellulosic biofuels category of credits back into the alternate fuel mixture credit. I know that there's about a 30% higher recovery with the cellulosic, at least if you have the confidence that you'll be able to get it. And I'm supposing, I guess, either maybe your depreciation analysis going forward or maybe even some political uncertainty could have been part of it. But I'd love to hear why you made that switch.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Rick, why don\u2019t you go ahead and get into the details?","Richard B. West","Yes, Chip.  From the 2 credits, you referenced the 30%. Of course, the benefit from the cellulosic biofuel producer credit after tax is $0.62, and the alternative fuel mixture is $0.50 per share, so it's not a total difference of that amount. But basically, it was a very complex issue. There were a number of factors that we considered, both from a tax and a benefits utilization strategy. It's really not something we'd like to get into in the call, and we discuss, normally, our tax strategy. As I said earlier in the call, we do have the benefit of now being able to take the credits in a more rapid basis, and that our cash tax rate could go down significantly from 20%, much lower, as we go through the year. But we need to see what's happening with the IRS audit underway before I can give you a definitive on a number of things, including the range that we gave, as well as what the cash tax rate would be.","Paul T. Stecko","Yes. Another way to look at it -- Chip, this is Paul. We basically reduced the range from 60 to 160 to, say, 40 to 140, so the number may not even change when we get done with the whole thing. It's just the range that's changed. And that thing is still a moving target. And as Rick said, until we get the audit completed, we're not really going to offer any more information on that subject.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Totally understand. And then just a quick follow-up. When you look at the -- this is becoming a routine, where you guys seem to be doing much better on the volume front. I know you're adding 2 conversion and you just mentioned the acquisition, but could you talk a little bit about what you see as the reason you guys are growing so much faster than the market, and also any thoughts as to why the market looks like it's actually slowed down a little bit versus GDP compared to, say, what were seeing a year or so ago?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Chip, again, when you look at our strategy over the last 2 years to enhance 5 of our box plants and help take care of their capability to service customers, that was the $80 million over 2010, 2011 at 5 of the plants. But also, Tom was very successful in executing 3 acquisitions last year, and then the one that we just announced. So when you think about the capabilities from a revenue side of the equation that the box plants now offer, it's quite a different footprint. So Tom, if you want to add and elaborate to that.","Thomas A. Hassfurther","All right. Yes, Chip, let me just add a little clarity to this thing and go back in time a little bit and refresh your memories about what our strategy was and continues to be, starting with the fact we want to become 90% integrated. And we wanted to do that 3 different ways: one was organic growth; the other one was strategic capital investment, and that was specifically in plants where we were at or near capacity; and the third way was through acquisition. And of course, we talked about the acquisition. And we made 4 acquisitions in the past 15 months, and that's resulted in approximately 3% additional growth for us. We also completed much of the strategic capital investment, currently north of about $40 million, and that of course relates to capacity needs driven almost exclusively by customer demand. And then the remaining is the organic growth, which we've talked about for a long time. It's a long-term strategy, requires a very long sales cycle. It involves hundreds, maybe thousands of accounts that have allowed us opportunities to grow. They're either growing or we've got opportunities with them to add value or earn a larger share of the market. And so that's -- we continue to do that. And of course, I'd be remiss if I didn't give our people a lot of credit for executing a very aggressive plan, and they're doing an incredibly good job. So that's where we stand with that. Relative to \"Is the market slowing down, and why is it not tracking GDP exactly?\" well, if you follow any of the trends that have gone on, and certainly FBA statistics and that sort of thing, you know that we kind of separated from GDP as an industry quite a while ago, and track probably more closely nondurables today than we do anything else. But I think we're still fairly bullish on what's going on with the economy. There'll be some ups and downs, and I still say that customers watch their inventories very, very closely. So we're seeing a few more swings one way or the other that maybe we wouldn't see in a more traditional economy.","Paul T. Stecko","And Chip, this is Paul. Let me just add one thing to what Tom said. I think he put everything in pretty good perspective, but when it comes to organic growth, we have outgrown the industry for over the last decade continually. And we think the reason is that our basic sales proposition is we sell value, not price. And if you can provide a customer more value than anybody else, we think that's what makes you successful. And you can provide value in a lot of ways. Now we can spend 2 hours on talking about how you provide value. But that more than anything else, in my opinion, is what's driven our success with regard to organic growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So just on the maintenance cost for the quarter. Obviously, it's up $0.03 from the first quarter. As we just think about the rest of the year, I know that sometimes there's the amortization cost that continues throughout the year. So I was just trying to calibrate how much we would add back, given that there's no more downtime for the rest of the year. Is it -- would it be the full $0.03 plus the first quarter amounts? Or is there amortization we need to factor in as well?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Rick, why don't you go ahead and get into the details?","Richard B. West","Yes. You really had the right point with the amortization of the repair cost. That is the one thing that you will continue to have. And so when you look at the second quarter to the third quarter, you will continue to have the amortization of repair cost, and it will go up from the second quarter. So net-net between the second quarter and the third quarter, I can't give a number, but you will have a higher repair cost compared to the second.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the energy projects, I think, Mark, you had mentioned in the last call that it is possible you might see the saves exceed the $0.26 that you talked about. I just want to get a sense of how that's progressing at this stage.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Everything we've talked about as far as -- I think we summarized and said all in, net about $0.26 benefit. We said $0.21 from the direct energy pieces themselves, and then with the increased volume that we added back net of the capitalized interest that was netted against that, we still feel comfortable that, that 26% -- $0.26 per share number for the year is still good. Everything we saw in the first quarter coming out of the Valdosta and Counce indicated that the boilers and turbines are doing exactly what we expected and have enhanced not only the energy picture but our capabilities to just run the mills more effectively and efficiently. So we still feel good with the numbers we've talked about.","Unknown Executive","We're comfortable with the number as we run this equipment. I guess our feeling is there may be a little more upside than downside to that number, but only time will tell.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. I just had to say, on the export markets, you talked about stabilizing pricing early in the first quarter, but you didn't really talked about anything about it picking up here at all in the second quarter. So I just want to know what you're seeing out there for the export markets in general. And obviously, there was a mill closure in Europe as well, so wondering how that might factor into your thinking about the opportunities on the export market.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Well, from a volume point of view, again, we said we're pretty well flat on volume. But Tom, do you have anything to elaborate on what you're seeing?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","Yes, I think all I can tell you is, Phil, we've -- we have advised our customers that prices will be going up in the second quarter. That's all I can tell you on the -- on that side of the business, and I think it's driven by a lot of different normal factors.","Operator","I'm showing our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari from Citi.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a follow-up on Chip's question on volumes. You referenced the 90% integration level goal. Are you at about -- or is it safe to say you're about 80% now? And in terms of the 90% goal, when do you think you can get there? Is that a 2-year goal or a 3-year goal?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Currently, we're at that 81% level with the -- again, as the mills have continued to perform well, that's been the factor there. But the goal would still be to go out to the end of 2014, 2, 3 years and with acquisition activity that we have in growing the organic side of the business to continue to achieve that 90% target. So yes, that's still the plan.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And in terms of a budget or a range that you would set aside for box plant acquisition, is there any kind of color that you can give, given the 3 that you picked up recently?","Mark W. Kowlzan","On a range per year of spending?","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, yes, over the next couple of years.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Well, just to go back. Last year's 3 acquisitions, we spent $57 million. And so around $50 million a year would probably be a good number, on average.","Richard B. West","Yes. That's been our historic average if you go back a decade, about $50 million in box plant acquisitions. Now that can vary from 0 to 100, depending on the year. You could have a year when you really can't find anything that really fits your model but the next year, you'll find a lot. But I think it would average $50 million a year going forward, and that's not cast in concrete but that's kind of our calibration.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Just one clarification. When you were talking about the downtime, costs, maintenance, et cetera, third quarter versus second quarter, I think, Rick, you focused on the repair expense. That would go up a little bit. But presumably, you don't have the 25,000 tons of lost production, and so you have that as a positive, 3Q to 2Q. And so if you net those 2, I would assume that your maintenance\/downtime costs would be lower in the third quarter than the second quarter. Is that a fair assumption?","Richard B. West","That is fair. We would not have the norm in the second quarter. We have the lost production plus you have the increased cost while you were down, as well as starting up and shutting down the equipment. So in the third quarter, you would not have the first 2 items, but you would have a higher amortization of annual outage repair cost in the third quarter compared to the second quarter.","Mark W. Kowlzan","And Mark, just to put it another way, the highest headwinds with regard to maintenance is in the second quarter this year. Those headwinds subside in the third and fourth quarter because we're not going to -- no downtime related. As you've said, the only point was it all doesn't go away because we amortize shutdowns over the rest of the year after they occur. So you can't take everything out but you take out the piece that you just said. So from an earnings point of view, and we don't give guidance more than one quarter in advance, the situation gets better third quarter over second.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And maybe I'm jumping ahead too far here. But -- so kind of order of magnitude about a $0.04, $0.05 -- $0.04 type of improvement, 3Q versus 2Q?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Yes. We only give guidance once and we try to be pretty disciplined about only going out one quarter at a time.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Sure. And just one quick other one. You continue obviously to  generate lots of free cash flow, particularly as your cash tax rate is going to be even lower. You have the box plant acquisitions. Is much of the remainder going to be focused on share repurchase? Or could you potentially even contemplate revisiting the dividend again sooner rather than later?","Mark W. Kowlzan","I think, as we've said in the past week, we continue dynamically to look at where our cash needs to be deployed, whether it's a balance of dividends, share buyback and reinvestment in the assets and the acquisitions. So we'll continue that process to evaluate as we go quarter to quarter and look at our cash accumulation and cash position. So again, that just remains a dynamic discussion amongst ourselves.","Richard B. West","Yes. If somebody tries to support [ph] it, we think $50 million is a number for acquisitions. I mean, we're very diligent in the way we pursue acquisitions, because in our business there are very high return but very high risk, depending on a lot of factors, so we take our time. But that just leaves dividends and share buyback. And share buyback is the most obvious vehicle because dividends involve a longer period of time. You have to be sure that you can sustain that dividend. So both are always in our mind. But obviously, we had a $150 million share buyback authorization. We're proceeding to spend that at an appropriate rate.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Connelly from CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Mark, 2 things. So you mentioned higher OCC costs this quarter, but are you seeing anything picking up in virgin fiber cost? We're starting to see wood products cost rise. In some regions that helps, sometimes it hurts, so I'm just curious whether you're seeing any movement on your cost on the virgin inside?","Mark W. Kowlzan","No. As a matter of fact, the virgin fiber side, especially in the South, remains really flat. And so we haven't had any of the weather extremes in the South this past -- from the fourth quarter going into the first quarter. So virgin, I guess we've talked about that before, I'd say it's trending pretty flat.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Do you have a view that if lumber does start to pick up in the South whether that's going to actually help you or hurt you?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Because of the residual chip volumes that would become available on the market, that would help. We've seen some of that activity actually in Michigan at our Filer City mill, with some sawmills producing more through the fall into the winter. And so there were more chips available on the market. So we've seen some of that activity starting to take place.","Richard B. West","Mark, in the lumber market, they cut big trees as opposed to smaller pulpwood trees, and they're going to make residuals as they cut those trees. And that waste wood has  got to find a home, and if that -- and we're hoping that the wood products business does pick up because at one time, for example, at our Counce mill, we got 1\/3 of our wood supply from sawmill residuals. We're down now to maybe 10%, 12%. And so when and if it picks up, we think it's a plus.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. Okay, that's helpful. Just one last question. You mentioned the rise in transportation cost. Is that making you  think differently about the inventories you want to carry?","Mark W. Kowlzan","No. Right now, the diesel is always a factor in the transportation cost. But also with the 4 acquisitions we have behind us and also the new Reading plant, the question of inventories and how we manage inventories is again dynamically changed in how we service the bigger fleet of box plants. So I think, going forward, our inventory model will remain somewhat the same, but we do need to consider how we service the additional plants we have.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Staphos from Bank of America.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to piggyback actually off of Mark's question there. As you look at the acquisitions that you've made and now the most recent one, should we assume that at least initially you have a somewhat more challenging logistical situation to make sure that you keep the customers that you acquired through these acquisitions? And as we think -- take a step back, think more broadly about the acquisitions that you've made, is it possible to perhaps peg what kind of accretion, either to earnings or cash flow returns, they can have when we look out, say, a year or so?","Mark W. Kowlzan","On the first part, from the logistics and how we service the customer base, no, that's not an issue. As a matter of fact, in many cases, our capabilities are enhanced with a bigger footprint. On the second question, Rick, do you want to talk about the accretion?","Richard B. West","No, that's not something we would get into, Mark -- I mean, George, trying to isolate profitability by an individual unit.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Would it be fair though, Rick, that you would have made these acquisitions with the assumption that it's enhancing to whatever relative level of return or free cash flow generation you had previously? Would that be fair?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Well, I think you can look at the volume. We said with the volume, we were up 8.3%, and without acquisitions, we would have been up 5.4%. So you're getting the throughput of the mills plus the box plant shipments of about 3%. So intuitively, those acquisitions are generating additional earnings for us. We just don't want to get into the specific numbers.","Richard B. West","And George, as I said earlier, we view this endeavor as a high-return, high-risk endeavor. High risk for the reasons you elaborated on, but high return for a lot of reasons, if you can make sure that you're not going to be encumbered by some of the potential downfall of making these acquisitions. And that's why we're very deliberate in the way we approach this. And so we've been extremely pleased with the returns we've gotten on these. That's not to say over the last 15 years we haven't been burned a few times for the reasons you elaborated on, but overall, we've been pretty successful in this regard. And Tom, I think you want to say something.","Thomas A. Hassfurther","Yes, George, this is Tom. I'd like to also add that in order to mitigate those risks, as I've mentioned, one of our key criterias in the acquisition process is a great management team and very talented people, and to make sure that they stay on board. That really helps mitigate that risk of losing customers or anything like that.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, I appreciate the color there. If we can switch topics to maintenance and the projects that you have underway. One of the things that you mentioned as part of the second quarter program is maintenance of the boiler walls. And I remember from one of the last calls -- perhaps incorrectly so, but I think this is true, that you're accelerating to some degree the maintenance on boiler walls. If that's true, can you elaborate a bit on that? And if it's true, should we expect perhaps a bit more than historically normal maintenance expense during the first half of the year on a going-forward basis?","Mark W. Kowlzan","The work that's underway right now at Counce, again, we were taking advantage of the very fact that we had the annual shutdown and some of that work could've been done over the next few years. But again, we had the ability to execute that work now and get that behind us. So in that regard, it's an isolated opportunity to upgrade and update the water wall on the boiler, so...","Paul T. Stecko","Just to amplify on it, every 6 years, as Mark said, we have a major turbine overhaul and we decided since the turbine was going to be down 16 days, why spread the boiler work over a couple of years? Hide the boiler work behind that turbine downtime. And that, in the long term, eliminates mill downtime and you save a bunch of money, although -- as you do the repair all at once. And so we took advantage of that fact that this only comes up once every 6 years, and we took advantage of it.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. My last question, I'll turn it over. Can you comment at all about early second quarter volume trends? If you'd mentioned before, I missed it.","Mark W. Kowlzan","On the first 8 days of cut-up [ph] for the month, we're seeing bookings up 10% and shipments up 6%, so all in all, the trend continues with what we saw in the first quarter, so we're still feeling pretty good about where our business is.","Operator","Our next question comes from Al Kabili from Credit Suisse.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess, Mark, maybe you could talk about -- you mentioned a richer mix that you see in this upcoming quarter. Is that just seasonality, or is there something else driving that? I wonder if you could just elaborate a little more on that.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Yes. That's pure seasonality taking place. So again, we see this every year.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then the second question I had, along the export markets, you mentioned you're telling your customers price increases. Is that across all the major geographies or is that primarily Europe? Or is that spread across Latin America, Asia as well?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Well, again, in general, we told our customers in the export market that prices will be increasing in the second quarter. And that's really all we want to comment regarding pricing.","Richard B. West","It does vary by market, by geography. And we're really not going to get more specific than that. We give that information to our customers. And that's always been our plan, to share that with customers and go no further.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then also, relative to the growth rates you're seeing, is there any particular end market that stands out directionally, one way or the other, that you're seeing? Or is it pretty broad-based in terms of the end markets and in terms of your shipment growth?","Mark W. Kowlzan","We continue to see a broad-based growth across our footprint in North America. So again, it's nothing in particular. All of our segments are continuing to move in the right direction.","Operator","Our next question comes from Philip Ng from Jefferies & Company.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Production levels were actually very strong during quarter. I would imagine you're obviously benefiting from some of your recent investments. But what's a good run rate for production capacity going forward? I know historically 1Q has been little lighter.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Yes. We don't get into forward quarters of production. So again, I think if you know what we've produced in the first quarter and what last year was, so again, I think that's all we want to say about the quarter.","Paul T. Stecko","We basically run to demand and that will determine our production level. The only thing that Mark did said earlier is that at the end of the second quarter, all of our maintenance outages will have been completed for the year. And -- but again, we don't -- we run to demand and we don't give projections more than one quarter out.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","But I mean, historically speaking, since most of your maintenance  is done in the first half, if demand is there, production is usually a little stronger in the back half, right? Is that fair?","Mark W. Kowlzan","That's very fair.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then a question for Rick. The CapEx for this year, I think it's in that  1 10 ballpark. Is that sustainable over the next few years? And do you have any other major projects on tap?","Richard B. West","We do not comment on CapEx but one year in advance. That's been our historical norm, 1 10, but we'll have to look at it each year. And that's all I could add on that, Phil.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just one final question on the inventory. It seemed a little higher 1Q than years past. It sounds like you're taking a little more downtime and you're expecting strong demand. One, is that the biggest reason? And two, is the expectation for inventory to come down over the next few quarters? I just want to get your view on the inventory level for the industry.","Mark W. Kowlzan","As usual, we had the shutdowns planned for the first and second quarters, so it was in our best interest to build inventory and plan to take care of and service our box plants as needed. So the 11,000 ton increase was actually necessary to take care of our business. So other than that, we also, as I'd mentioned earlier, with the new acquisitions and the new Reading plant, 5 additional plants to service, so nothing's changed there.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. I just wanted to get your thoughts on the inventory level for the industry.","Mark W. Kowlzan","No comment. We don't comment regarding that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joshua Zaret from Longbow Research.","Joshua L. Zaret - Longbow Research LLC","A quick question. With the huge consolidation trend we're seeing, 4 major players of the past now involved in consolidation, is that benefiting you in terms of customer churn and people coming your way? Are you seeing anything in that direction?","Mark W. Kowlzan","The only thing we'd offer on that is that every time anything happens in the industry, there are pluses and minus. And one plus of it is that if 2 people got together as a result of a merger, and they were the 2 suppliers to a company that wanted to have 2 different suppliers, then that company, the buyer, would have to seek another supplier because the 2 suppliers they had now became one supplier.","Joshua L. Zaret - Longbow Research LLC","Right. That's what I'm getting at. So is that benefiting you?","Mark W. Kowlzan","That benefits us. That's correct.","Joshua L. Zaret - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then to change quickly, can you remind us what percentage of your box shipment and market is agriculture?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Tom, do you want to take a shot? It's a low number.","Thomas A. Hassfurther","It's a very low number. We're not very high in ag.","Joshua L. Zaret - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, that's what I thought. And so then the final question, when you're purchasing your corrugated  [ph] box plants, is there a theme in terms of end markets that you're focusing on, or technologies or anything in that respect?","Mark W. Kowlzan","No, not really. If you really look at our spread of business, and I think that's what gives us some tremendous strength, you're talking about thousands and thousands of accounts spread over all sorts of different industries. And we try to obviously pick the winners in those industries if we possibly can, because they're going to have the best opportunity to grow. But with regard to acquisitions, it's more built around relationships, their ability to add value, how well they fit into our model. Are they willing to do the hard to do? Have they earned the right to have that long-term reputation with the customers? And of course, are those customers in industries that are going to survive? I mean, that's obviously one of the things we take a look at. But for the most part, if there's -- any of those acquisitions, their customer base is spread very much like ours is.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Chercover from D. A. Davidson.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","I was surprised it took so long to get to the question as to the implications of the recent consolidation. And I heard your answer. Does the consolidation spur you to expand to any U.S. geographies where you're not currently exposed?","Mark W. Kowlzan","We've said for a long time we're in every major market, except the Pacific Northwest. And so we don't feel the need to be in every market, in that we're not in one because we're geographically disadvantaged and so far away. So we look for box plants that, as Tom just elaborated on the detail, meet our criteria and not generally focus on a specific geography where we need to be.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","[Operator Instructions] I'm showing our next question comes from Scott Gaffner from Barclays.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was just hoping if you could dig a little bit deeper into your response to the 2Q positive mix shift. You mentioned seasonality, but does seasonality drive higher-value products? And if so, what are we talking about here?","Mark W. Kowlzan","The seasonality does drive some of the higher-priced products, that's true, and demand starts to typically starts to ramp up a little bit. And that's why if you look at our comparables, last year, we were up. This year, we're saying we're going to be up again. That's pretty much the trend.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then looking at the transportation cost, it's been a headwind all of 2011, obviously starting off again as a headwind this year. I think before you talked about 50% of your shipments are rail versus truck. Is there anything that you can do to sort of manage the outbound transportation cost?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Well, again, because of the diesel factor, you have your trucking and your rail available and you optimize that mix. And so on any given week, any given month, it's an optimization question on how you take advantage of that.","Paul T. Stecko","You misquoted, you misquoted us just a little bit. I think it's good that we correct that. 50% of our shipments are roughly truck\/rail that's coming out of our mills. Out of our box plants, it's virtually 100% truck. So it's very skewed to trucking when you throw in the box plant. You can't ship boxes by rail. The rail system doesn't operate that way. So most of our shipments are trucked, and that's why diesel is such an important variable.","Unknown Executive","And the one thing on the box plant side, Scott, is that we can -- we obviously focus very much on cubing the trailers, because we can't  weight out trailers in the box business, so you focus heavily on cubic miles.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Atkinson from BMO Capital Markets.","Joe Licursi - BMO Capital Markets Canada","It's Joe Licursi. I don't know if you've covered this, but when you talk about the Counce turbo generator overhaul, do you expect any benefits, like in terms of additional production or lower cost, like incremental to what you're planning?","Mark W. Kowlzan","No, this is just a 6-year routine overhaul, with the turbine going through all its maintenance requirements just to maintain it.","Paul T. Stecko","Just like your car, when you overhaul, you hope it runs good for another 6 years.","Joe Licursi - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Okay, so it's just maintenance, right?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Tumazos from John Tumazos Very.","John Charles Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research, LLC","In the $0.45 guidance for the second quarter, what is your estimate of natural gas prices? And are there any other ingredient price estimates of note?","Mark W. Kowlzan","What we're seeing with natural gas, what we estimate is that natural gas remains flat at that low level we're currently experiencing.","Richard B. West","And John, we don't use much gas in our mills to speak of, but we do get a big savings in our box plants because most of our box plants' boilers are fired with natural gas, so the bulk of the savings will be in the box plants, not the mills.","John Charles Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research, LLC","So does flat mean the same price and volumes used as the first quarter or as a year ago?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Well, again, you're going from winter season into a spring, summer season period. So typically, your usage volume does fall going into the warmer climate, warmer season. One other thing, we did have some physical contracts purchased out in advance but those did expire in the first quarter, so we will get a little bit of benefit from the  fact that we'll be buying at the market price now versus the physical contract price. But it's not a huge number.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Staphos from Bank of America.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Quick one. We hear a lot about manufacturing perhaps seeing a renaissance here in the United States over the next number of years, given what's transpired in the emerging markets, given the cost position. Are there 2 or 3 concrete tangible evidences from what you see that that's in fact happening? Or from your vantage point, it's a lot of discussion, but really without a lot of reality at this juncture, in terms of manufacturing we're covering here, relative to where it had been in the U.S.","Paul T. Stecko","Yes. George, let me take that. We have some tangible results but we're not going to share them with our competitors on this call. But there's a lot of tangible examples have been published in the Wall Street Journal over the last 2 months. So I think there's a lot of anecdotal evidence, very specific, that, that indeed has started to happen, and we certainly hope that it continues.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Paul, if that's happening, how long do you think it takes for the supply chain around manufacturing to build out, right? If manufacturing, say, of washing machine -- I mean, that's not the right example, is improving, your fabricators, your tool and die guys, all these guys have to start building back up again. Is that a 1-year or a 3-year phenomenon? Or how would you think about it?","Paul T. Stecko","The short answer is, \"I don't know.\" I've never manufactured washing machines. But there are better people that you can ask than us. We simply don't know.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Mark W. Kowlzan","With no more questions, thank you for joining us today.

Your host for today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chief Executive Office for PCA. Upon conclusion of his narrative, there will be a Q&A session. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kowlzan, and please proceed when you are ready.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Good morning, and welcome to Packaging Corporation of America's First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. I'm Mark Kowlzan, CEO of PCA, and with me on the call today is Paul Stecko, Executive Chairman of PCA; Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs our Corrugated business; and Rick West, PCA's Chief Financial Officer. Thanks for participating in this morning's call and after the presentation, I will be glad to take any questions.","Yesterday, we reported record first quarter net income of $61 million or $0.62 per share compared to adjusted net income, excluding special items in the first quarter of 2012, of $41 million or $0.42 per share. The $0.20 per share increase in earnings, excluding 2012's special items, was driven by higher Containerboard and Corrugated Products prices and mix of $0.23 per share, increased sales volume of $0.05 per share and lower recycled fiber costs of $0.01 per share. These items were partially offset by higher costs including labor and benefits of $0.06 per share; workers' compensation of $0.01 per share; energy, $0.01 per share; and transportation, $0.01 per share.","Net sales were a record $755 million, up 12% compared to the first quarter of 2012 net sales of $671 million. We had a very strong quarter in all aspects of our operations with higher pricing and strong volume driving all-time records for sales, corrugated product shipments and earnings per share.","Corrugated products demand was stronger than we expected throughout the quarter, and our price and mix was also better than forecasted. The stronger than expected volume, price and mix drove our earnings higher than our January guidance by about $0.06 per share.","Looking at more details of the operations, our Corrugated product shipments per workday were up 7.1% with 2 less workdays than last year's first quarter, and total shipments were up 3.8%. Excluding our March 2012 box plant acquisition, shipments per workday were up 5.8% and total shipments, up 2.5%.","The containerboard market has remained tight for us, and our outside sales of containerboard and this year's first quarter were basically the same as in the first and fourth quarters of last year, even with the constraint of having to build some containerboard inventory to help support our second quarter maintenance downtime.","Our prices for containerboard and corrugated products were up over the last year's first quarter, reflecting the full realization of fourth quarter domestic containerboard and corrugated products price increases and higher export prices. Our mix was also richer as I mentioned earlier. All of our mills ran exceptionally well, producing a first quarter record, 646,000 tons of containerboard, up 6,000 tons over the first quarter of 2012. This record performance was driven by lower annual average downtime and improved productivity, which more than offset 1 less production day compared to last year's first quarter, which included an additional production day for leap year.","Annual mill maintenance outages reduced linerboard production by about 7,000 tons during the first quarter with No. 2 paper machine at our Counce, Tennessee linerboard mill down for 5 days in March.","The strong mill performance allowed us to meet our strong demand and build 3,000 tons of needed containerboard inventory. Most of our mill maintenance outage work this year will occur in the second quarter, resulting in 30,000 tons of lost production. Historically, most from our annual mill maintenance outages have ever occurred in first quarter. The No. 1 machine at Counce was down 8 days earlier this month to complete their outages for 2013.","At our Tomahawk, Wisconsin medium mill, our larger machine No. 4 was down for 5 days last week, and we now have our No. 2 machine down, which is expected to start up on this Thursday after the a 4-day outage. Our Valdosta, Georgia linerboard mill would be down for 8 days in May.","We will complete our 2013 annual maintenance outages in the fourth quarter with a relatively small outage at our Filer City, Michigan medium mill.","With regard to cost, compared to the first quarter of 2012, higher labor and benefits costs reduced earnings by about $0.06 per share with $0.03 per share from annual wage increases; $0.02 per share from benefits inflation; and $0.01 per share from higher incentives. Workers' compensation costs were also up over the last year's first quarter, reducing earnings by about $0.01 per share.","Wood costs were flat with last year. Extremely wet weather conditions only affected our wood costs at our Counce mill in January, after which the weather conditions improved considerably. Recycled fiber costs were lower than last year's first quarter, improving earnings by $0.01 per share, but up over the fourth quarter, reducing earnings by $0.01 a share. Finally, our transportation costs and higher energy costs from coal price being up from last year each reduced earnings by about $0.01 per share compared to last year's first quarter.","I'm now going to turn it over to Rick West, our CFO, who will give an update on our cash generation and uses during the first quarter.","Richard B. West","Thank you, Mark. In the first quarter, PCA generated cash from operations, before working capital changes, of $128 million. Working capital increased by $32 million, driven by beginning of the year payments, including incentive bonuses, increased receivable levels and other seasonal changes resulting in net cash generated, after working capital changes, of $96 million. Historically, the first quarter is our lowest cost cash generation quarter with several beginning of the year payments.  We expect our cash generation to be significantly higher for the remainder of the year with our fourth quarter being the highest cash-generating quarter.","Capital expenditures were $27 million during the quarter. We take no quarterly common stock dividends in the first quarter as a result of paying our normal January dividend payment in December 2012.  We repurchased 121,000 shares of PCA's stock in the first quarter for $5 million, or an average of $42.47 per share. As of March 31, 2013, our diluted shares outstanding were 97.4 million shares.","At quarter end, we had $268 million cash on hand and our total long-term debt, excluding capital leases, is $790 million. During the first quarter, cash tax payments of $4 million were made and we used $7 million of fuel tax credits.","On April 15, we also used $32 million in tax credits to fully offset our scheduled federal tax payment.  We currently have estimated remaining fuel tax credits of $37 million, which will be used to offset future tax payments. However, the final amount of the available fuel tax credits and the final cash tax rate is contingent upon the conclusion of the IRS audit, currently underway. With that, I will turn it back over to Mark.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Thank you, Rick. Looking ahead, we expect seasonally stronger volume and higher prices in the second quarter. However, the majority of the earnings benefit from price increases will not be realized until the third quarter, when April containerboard price increase pass-through to corrugated products is completed. Also, as I've said earlier, most of our annual mill maintenance this year will occur in the second quarter with outages at 3 of our 4 mills.  We expect these outages to reduce our containerboard production by 30,000 tons in the second quarter compared to 7,000 tons of lost production from maintenance downtime in the first quarter. The 23,000 tons of additional lost production, along with higher repair and operating costs from these outages, is expected to reduce earnings by $0.08 per share compared to the first quarter. We also expect higher transportation, recycled fiber and purchased electricity costs. Considering these items, we currently expect second quarter earnings of about $0.62 a share.","With that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. These statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC. The actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. And with that, operator, I'd like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Marc Weintraub from Buckingham.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Mark, is it fair to say that the higher transport recycled and purchased electricity -- might that be order magnitude $0.03 to $0.04, 2Q v 1Q?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Yes, but $0.01 per piece is a good number, Mark.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. Excellent. And then on use of cash, clearly -- particularly, one, as this price increase gets implemented, you're going to be generating a lot of excess cash even relative to where you're dividend payout is currently. Are you comfortable building your cash balance? Or if you don't find bolt-ons, et cetera, would you look to, more aggressively, return cash to shareholders?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Short-term, we're comfortable, Mark.  And again, that's something that we discussed, I think, on every board meeting, so -- currently, we're going to stay with our strategy, but short-term, we're comfortable. And Paul, you want to add any comments on that?","Paul T. Stecko","No, I think you said exactly right. We're building cash here. It's a little faster rate than what we think is optimum. Quite frankly, we felt that with the macroeconomics worldwide that the stock market might have corrected in the first quarter and that would be a good buying opportunity, their buy back shares, that didn't happen. I mean, we're not unhappy that didn't happen not because the stock performed well, but we can't wait for that forever.  And so short-term, we're okay. Long-term, we know we have to do something. And it's the normal vehicles in terms of dividends, share buybacks, very high-return capital projects.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","That's very helpful. And lastly, one quick one, can you give us an update on what's happening with export pricing, containerboard pricing?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","Yes, Mark. This is Tom Hassfurther. Yes, export pricing continues to go up. It goes up differently than what it does domestically. As we've talked about before, there's smaller increments, but it does continue to go up.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari from Citigroup.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","You discussed stronger-than-expected corrugated demand in the quarter. And I was wondering if you could give any color on that. People have talked about housing recovery, e-commerce and online shopping, return-to-manufacturing activity as being drivers. Are -- were any of those meaningful drivers in the quarter? And what kind of color can you give us on kind of the improved demand you saw?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Again, just recapping when we talked in January, we started out the quarter in saying that bookings were 4.5%, and we felt comfortable that we had a good quarter starting. I think, specifically, and I'm going to let Tom add some color, but, well, we saw a strong volume across-the-board. Again, much, much stronger than what we expected. But Tom, won't you add some specifics to that?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","Yes, I would agree that interestingly enough, and the good news is that the volume did come from numerous areas and it wasn't concentrated, just in a particular industry or particular business. And I think, really for PCA, I think most of it is a result of our strategic capital that we've invested, the outstanding acquisitions that we've made. And basically, it's our value proposition that we have out there. Most of the growth was organic and from existing customers. The other thing I might add is, is that we had a very unusual March this year in terms of 20 workdays versus the norm, which would be closer to 22 workdays. And so on a per workday basis, it looks like March was very high. But overall, it was level with the previous March. Now, those numbers will reverse in April, because April in the second quarter is typically a 20-day month, that will be a 22-day month this year. So our demand will be up maybe 1% or so in total, but on a per workday -- or I'm sorry, in total, but on a per workday basis, it will come up to about 10%. So it's just a little unusual what went on the first, third quarter versus what we'll have on the second quarter.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And just to be clear, so for the first 3 weeks of April, on a per week -- per workday basis, can you repeat what you're seeing?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","To start out on these first 13 days and top bookings and billings. Bookings were up 4.7%. Billings always lag -- were at 1% increase in -- and we always see this as the month closes out, the bookings and billings close the gap and billings catch up to the bookings. And so again, we're right at that 4.7%, round up, 5% for the first 13 days on bookings orders.","Paul T. Stecko","But up 1 on billings -- this is Paul Stecko. And you got to be careful of that number because last year, it's a very tough comparable. We were up 4% in April -- excuse me, we were up 8.4% in April, so it's a tough comparable.  And as Tom Hassfurther was pointing out, we're up about 1% on a per workday month-to-date, but with 2 more days, up 1% translates into up 10% for the month in total volume. So it could be a very, very strong quarter.  Bookings are indicating that we may do better than that because as Mark said, we're up 5% of bookings, but that seems like a pretty hard number to sustain the rest of the month. We'll have to see. And I don't think we'll sustain that rate for the month, or I mean, the numbers get real big.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chip Dillon from Vertical Research Partners.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","The revenue number you guys put up, at least for -- versus our model was quite impressive, and I think you mentioned the box demand was particularly strong. Could you -- and I know last year, your integration level, I believe, was 83%. Could you tell us what the -- as you look at the integration level was in the first quarter, and are you seeing your mix of boxes change, at least on the revenue side where you're getting -- you're selling the more of a value-added product?","Mark W. Kowlzan","On the first question, integration, we're right at 84.5%, 85% for the first quarter. And so again, we continue to improve that integration level per our plan. The next part of the question, again, we've specifically stated, we did see a richer mix in this first quarter, more so than we had expected to see in our product, so -- Tom, you want to add any color to that?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","Well, Chip, I would just say that if you do more of the hard to do, you're going to get paid more for that. And that's kind of what we've set out to do a long time ago, and we continue to take on those challenges and try to do it in the most cost-effective manner. So I think that's one of the keys that drives are up.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Yes, and I guess the other point, Chip, on integration, that's one of our main goals. Get that integration level up because we make money, not only on the board we sell, we also make money in the box plants as opposed to just selling paper on the outside. And what makes getting the integration level up a little more difficult is we continue to improve the productivity in the mills. We were up 6,000 tons over our last year's first quarter. So you got to sell those 6,000 each and you haven't moved the integration level at all. So it's a steeper slope when you have to offset high productivity, and it's a high-class problem, I'll admit, but that makes getting the integration level up more difficult.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Got you. And then can you talk a little bit about your wood costs? And maybe as you look out, it would seem like the -- in the upper Midwest that you're seeing, I think, wood costs come down as lumber production picks up. And would you expect to see that as chip productions higher, or on the other hand, do you think your wood costs are going to hedge up as we go through the year?","Richard B. West","Chip, in general, across-the-board, we're flat.  Regionally, we see some movement up and down a little bit. Obviously, earlier this winter, we saw some activity in the Counce region with the wet weather. In general, nationwide, up north, as you just referred to, what we started seeing a year ago the increased activity in the sawmill business and that did bring more chips to the marketplace. And so the net effect, again, on our pricing was pretty flat.  We've seen a little bit of movement in the Southeastern region as far as pine pricing, not as high as indicated in some of the periodicals and publications. But we're seeing some of the weather effect and also some of the dimensional lumber in the pine market increasing. But again in general, we're pretty flat across-the-board.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Got you. And then just the last question. Paul, I know your contract as Executive Chairman struck a few years ago. I think it expires on June 30. Could you let us know what your plans or the company's plans might be going forward?","Paul T. Stecko","Yes, but not today. That's something that obviously has to be answered in the next couple of months, so we have a board meeting in early May. And at the appropriate time, we'll give everybody an update on that situation. But it's premature to answer that question now.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Staphos from Bank of America Securities.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm wondering if you could get into the impact of outages this second quarter versus last year's second quarter. Now, this year you mentioned it's going to be $0.08 penalizing sequentially. If I'm not mistaken, last year, the impact was only $0.03 or so in terms of the sequential negative. This year, you said -- I think there's 30,000 tons of production that you're losing. Last year -- I want to say that the lost production was in the range of 20,000 tons or so, if you could confirm that. And then just give us a bit more color in terms of why this year's second quarter has that much more of an EPS impact, it'd be appreciated. And also Mark, do you have a goal for inventory regeneration or build this quarter that you could share with us?","Mark W. Kowlzan","I'm going to let Rick handle the first part of that, and then we'll talk about the inventory.","Richard B. West","George, you're correct in your numbers, but I would point out 3 things, just as far as the maintenance outages and components of costs. You have basically 3 costs: the cost of the production losses; the costs of the operations being down, start up, shut down, conflicts in the traditional fuel cost while you're down and operating, continuing to operate the middle parts of it; and then the third part is the amortization of repair job costs. And what happened this year in the first quarter, we had a very abnormally low repair job amortization cost as a result of the Counce outage being in the last week of March. Basically, the repair job amortization cost in the first quarter was only $0.002. Now when you go into the second quarter, that number goes up to about $0.04. So that's really the big difference.  This year, it's just the additional production losses compared to last year plus the amortization of repair jobs. If you look it in total for the first quarter, annual outages impacted us about $0.02 a share. In the second quarter, we expected to impact this $0.10 per share, thus, being the $0.08 difference, made up of the 2 components I talked about -- or 3 components. For the most part, the additional production losses, plus the additional repair job amortization, plus, to a lesser extent, operating costs. Now when you go to the third quarter, we do not have any production losses nor we have the incremental operating costs. You only have the repair job amortization. And with the timing from the second to the third quarter, that's probably less than 0.5% increase. So you're going to -- the pickup from the second to the third quarter from the annual outage impact is you get a $0.06 per share improvement going from the second quarter to the third quarter. So that's basically the math why it changes and why this year is so much, I would say, higher going from the first to the second, is both the timing of the outages and the repair job amortization is the big item.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Rick, that's great. I appreciate all the detail on that. On the inventory bill, do you have a goal that you'd like to hit for the second quarter that you can share with us?","Mark W. Kowlzan","George, we never really specifically quantify the goal. Obviously, we talked about our increased -- the number going up for the first quarter, that was our desire. And this being a heavy shutdown period, actually, you can assume that the inventory would be a draw down for, with that being said, a lot of that depends on how well the mill is run through the shutdown period and after the shutdown period. And also on export demand and export sales, so with that, but we never disclose the absolute inventory targets.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Understood. I guess the last 2 questions I'll ask them in sequence and turn it over. One, from the demand trends that you saw, Tom, any signs that maybe customers are trying to get ahead of the price increase in April and that's why demand was a little bit better than expected? And then back to cost marketing, you saw 6% increase in cost this quarter in aggregate, certainly you delineated what those factors were. Should we anticipate that this is going to be the run rate, if you will, on cost performance for the company over the intermediate term?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","This is Tom, I'll take the first question. As far as demand trends, we're trying to -- or seeing if customers were trying to perhaps beat the increase by ordering early, I would say, no. The demand was very steady throughout the quarter. And as I mentioned, on the per work day basis, March jumps significantly but it's because of a 20-day month. So with that, I'll turn it over to Mark or Rick, and let you handle that second.","Richard B. West","In terms of the cost, George, if you look at the labor, what we said, 3 was from manual wage increases, 2 was from benefits and 1 was from variable based incentives. I would say on the first one, the $0.03 per share, you're probably going to get that every quarter going forward. The second one, on the incentives, that's going to drop off a little bit in the second quarter because as we said earlier, we pay a lot of our statutory based in...","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Let me just direct it, when you said incentives, you meant benefits?","Richard B. West","Benefits, excuse me. In benefits, they do drop off in the second quarter because of the FICA and other statutories that we'd reach certain levels for certain employees and we'd stop deducting. So that will possibly -- could go down. As far as the variable based incentives though, it depends on our final payout for the year. So I can't give you an answer on that. And the other items, we put into our forecast higher electricity for the second quarter, that's more driven by summer rate or rate increases.  So that's hard to tell for the remainder of the year. And of course, recycled fiber and transportation, it depends on the price for recycled fiber and for the transportation diesel prices.","Paul T. Stecko","And the only think I'd add, George, this is Paul, on incentives. Our incentives are tied to the level of profitability and so there's a performance factor here. The more we make, the higher incentives go, the less they make, the lower they go. So obviously, they may go up, but consider that good news because that means we're doing very, very well. And that's the number you'd like to see go up, rather than down, because there's a huge leverage on that number and so we're hoping that number goes up because we're hoping to do even better.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Wilde from Deutsche Bank.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Tom, I wondered if you can talk a little more about that mix improvement that you saw. Is that kind of one-time thing? Or is there kind of just structurally a continuing trend in your mix moving up?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","Well, I'd say, Mark, there's a couple of things: I mean, one, is obviously we have -- we do have some seasonal mix changes with regard to the display and graphic side of the business. Those hit at various times and March is typically one of those times when it begins to ramp up. I would say in addition, I think that with the targeted customers we've had, the things we do for those customers, the value we add and some of the things we do and in addition to, I will call the normal course of business for those customers, that has proved to be -- it does pay better. And that does help improve our mix. We just have to carry out through the year.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","You've talked in the past about the interest in acquiring boxed plants. I'm just curious about what you're doing in terms of organic expansion and your converting capacity.","Thomas A. Hassfurther","Well, the organic side of the business was -- the organic expansion and growth in our business was primarily driven by our strategic capital investments that we made, which were driven around a particular customer base. And as we pointed out before, these were primarily in facilities that we were out of capacity. We needed additional capacity to be able to grow with our customer base and we've done that and those have obviously paid nice dividends.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. And are you actually adding any new facilities?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","No, we're not adding new facilities at this point in time. We will continue to do our strategic capital investments, but we'll continue to take advantage of opportunities as they present themselves. But if we need to rebuild, go new, consolidate, whatever, we consider all the above.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Mark, the thing that I'd add and just amplify on the point that Tom made, we spent $40 million a year 2 years ago, $40 million last year, to complete this internal growth project. And we did add a new plant in Reading, Pennsylvania, which is doing very, very well. That was in a market where we needed capacity.  And the returns have been very good, obviously, that's reflected in our numbers. And one of the reasons for that and the real advantage of internal growth, is that you may put a new piece of equipment in or a bigger piece of equipment. But based -- all the overhead is already amortized across your existing customer base. So those incremental tons of box business you bring in there, carry not only the normal profit, there's no overhead to observe. So the incremental profit levels are very good on these internal growth projects and we continue to look for more opportunities to do that. But our policy has been doing in regions where you know you have business and you need it, don't be speculative and just do it, we don't do it that way.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. Okay, all right. Now last question I had is, Rick, can you just remind us, when we look into the fourth quarter, about how much should we assume for that Filer City outage?","Richard B. West","It's a little premature right now, Mark, to give that number. They're still trying to determine the scope for the Filer City outage. It's basically about a 5- to 7-day outage and you can calculate the tons. And then there'll be the repair job cost that will have to be amortized in the fourth quarter because you have to amortize all the cost after you have the outage. But at this point, we'll be able to give you a better update when we have the second quarter earnings call in July.","Operator","The next question comes from Scott Gaffner from Barclays.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just wanted to talk a little bit about the potential for productivity and capacity creep in 2013. I think on the last call, we talked about it may be moderating back down to something closer to 1% the production in the first quarter can go a bit better than what we were expecting. Is there potential that capacity creep in 2013 could be greater than that 1%?","Richard B. West","I think the 1% is a number we're comfortable with, and I think that's a realistic number. That's a good number. There's a lot of activity around that, but the 1% is a number that we believe is realistic.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And going back to the capital allocation share repurchase question at the beginning, you're producing a significant amount of free cash flow here. If predictions around the industry are correct, you're going to continue to produce that free cash flow and potentially this chair has never pull back. I mean, at what point do we sort of move to a more normalized repurchase focus rather than waiting for the shares to pull back?","Paul T. Stecko","Well, as I said, this is Paul Stecko, as I said earlier on the call, we can only wait so long. And we're getting close to have and make a call on it because we cannot let the cash continue to build.  And quite frankly, if the stock keeps moving up and we keep generating cash, that not only puts pressure on us to increase our share buyback, but to raise the dividend also because we do have some desire to continue to have a good yield. And it's great because the share price goes up, but that puts pressure on your yield. So the only way to fix that problem is to increase the dividend. And that's the kind of thing we're chewing on right now.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. I appreciate that. And just lastly, when we look at your energy cost, specifically in the mill system, I think you mentioned higher coal prices earlier. What's sort of the mix now coal versus natural gas on the energy side?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","Coal is -- I don't have that exact percentage, but it's very small amount right now. We burned a lot of natural gas over the last 1.5 year, so we can get back with you on the specifics.","Operator","Next question, Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A couple of quick questions. First one is, the recent trade press has talked a lot about box customers putting more business out to bid [ph] here with the second price increase. So I guess I just have 2 questions on that. The first is are you seeing this at all and perhaps with some of the larger customers actually coming to you as an alternative supplier even more than normal in the last month or 2? And then the flip side of that question is with all this talk, do you have any concerns as to whether actually the full 30 per ton can get pass through to the back side?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","Phil, it's Tom, I'll take that real quick. With regard to bids, the truth has always been the tranches. And you'll have some -- some will bid, many will not. The bids that are out there right now, most are in the, what I would call, the normal course of doing business. It's more timing than it is than anything else. Over all, I would say there's nothing really unusual with regard to what's going on in the bids. The speculating on the amount of the increase and that sort of stuff, when it comes to boxes, I mean, we don't do that kind of speculation so I can't really go there.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. Then I guess just in terms of the actual number in the guidance for the second quarter, Rick, are you expecting some portion of the price increase on the box side in the second quarter? And is it fair to say that the full run rate of your expectation would kind of be in there by the July timeframe?","Richard B. West","I will only comment as to what we said in our press release and we did say that we expected higher prices in the second quarter, but the majority of the earnings benefit, as we said, would be from price increases, will be in the third quarter when our April container board price increase pass through to corrugated products is completed. So we did do have some of the price increase in there in the second quarter, but as we said earlier, the majority will be in the third quarter.","Operator","Next question comes from Mark Connelly from CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Mark, you talked a lot about the improvement in mix from targeted customers. Can you tell us which part of your customer base is really showing you the best improvement right now? And second, a broader question, looking back over the years, your mix has always been quite different from the major producers. Is it getting more different these days based on both your behavior and the behavior of the major producers? Are you moving further away than where you normally would've thought of yourself?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Again, the first part of your question, we've seen improvement across the board. And yet if you look at our customer base in terms of national account type business, our top 30 accounts still account for roughly 30% of our business, that being the national account type of customers. And then the other 2\/3 is the local accounts. We've grown with both the local accounts and the national accounts footprint. Tom, do you want to add anything to that?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","Yes. I would say, Mark, with regards to the mix I mean and in comparison to the rest of the industry, I can't really compare with the rest of the industry. I just know we do what we do and we do it well. And we pursue our targets, and that's what they do. It's proving to be good for PCA.","Operator","Next question from Al Ovshey from Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","When you look at the $0.23 benefit in the year-over-year basis from price and mix, is there a way to parse out what the benefit was from improved mix?","Richard B. West","Yes, there is. We rarely do that because it's hard to completely know a separate price and mix because they may buy different items. We may sell a thousand items to somebody and they may buy more of the higher priced items as opposed to something high-end graphics versus a plain brown box. So we take a guess at it and -- but the safest thing for us to do when we report it is to combine the 2 because we know the combined number is totally accurate. And if we break it in 2, there's some uncertainty around both numbers, so we do have an internal estimate of the difference and it's probably close, but we don't break them apart.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, I understand. And then if you think about your outlook for demand and the fact that we're entering a seasonally strong part, most demand inventories are pretty lean, you have the potential maintenance downtime scheduled for the quarter. Are you concerned that you may not be able to fully meet all the customer commitments that you have for the second quarter?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","We planned on that fact. And we also commented previously that we would move our export tonnage down to accommodate our domestic business. And so again, right now, we're not concerned. We plan on getting through this quarter and taking care of our customer base. And again, we will utilize the -- and rationalize the export side of the equation.","Mark W. Kowlzan","And I guess, Mark, used a very important word, plan. We could have built more inventory in the first quarter but we will have had to cut off some export customers. And we are dependable supplier so we told our customers, yes, you're going to get what we promised you in the first quarter. You may only get this much in the second quarter. If we have more productivity, then we put in our plan, we may be able to get you some more tons in the second quarter, but you ought to plan on this number for the second quarter. And so we made a decision to make sure we met all of our commitments in the first quarter and gave customers some notice so they can do some planning in the export. Because that is our bellows, that's where we can swing on our export tonnage. And we're hoping that productivity is better than we forecast, although, we have aggressive forecast. And what our customers knew a quarter in advance, what they could expect in the second quarter.","Operator","Next question is from Steve Chercover from D.A. Davidson.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones. In January, you projected both higher OCC and higher virgin fiber and we know that OCC turned out to be a $0.01 tailwind. How much did the higher virgin fiber expectation factor into your Q1 guidance?","Richard B. West","It was a minimal amount. This is Rick West. Going from into our first quarter, we don't break down every item, but it was not a great amount because we didn't think the weather would continue, but we were looking at the first quarter as basically a risk more so to our guidance with the wood cost continuing throughout the quarter. And we just want to make it clear when we gave the first quarter guidance, that that wasn't risk guidance. So not a substantial change from what was in the guidance, but more so a risk. When we started up the first part of January, we were suffering some very, very bad weather in that Counce area. It put some tremendous pressure on the wind basket in the Counce region and then by the latter part of January, the weather turned and improved and so, again, that risk factor was taken off the table.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Got you. And then the second one, it sounds like your inventories are verging on being too low. Is that why the transportation costs go up because you're really moving from mill to mill? Because it seems like, otherwise, oil and gas prices are on the decline.","Mark W. Kowlzan","It's a combination. Primarily, though, diesel rates move up and down. But sure, quarter-to-quarter, we can move tonnage from plant to plant as need be.  And as an example right now, we've got some transportation packed up in the Michigan area, with the flooding going on. And specifically, we're moving some tonnage out of rail into truck right now, with some of the rail lines being underwater up in Michigan for the next few weeks. So there's various activities but diesel fuel is usually the big driver.","Operator","Next question comes from Al Kabili from Macquarie.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Just a question on the, boy, the volume outperformance, you never seem to cease to amaze on the outperformance versus the industry. And I would have guessed that it's probably more than you would have thought last year. Do you think that this level of outperformance from what you can see thus far, would be sustainable throughout the remainder of the year?","Mark W. Kowlzan","That's something we don't want to comment on from a forward point of view. Again, we stick to our plan and again, we've been very pleased with the outcome of our strategic efforts over the last 3 years in the boxed plants and the mills. So other than that, we really can't comment.","Paul T. Stecko","Yes. But I will add one further comment on the volume expectations for the fourth quarter. It was strong stronger than we thought. Just driven by the macro economics, what you read in the paper, what's going on, what's going on in Washington? Is there going to be a drag on the economy, et cetera, et cetera. And you do factor some conservatism into your estimates, and the economy is trudging along better than we -- the papers will lead you to believe and I think that also translated into some better volume for us.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Okay, that's great. And it sounds like, on a related question, I mean, I think it sounds like from the commentary, you're still thinking $50 million of investment for strategic investments in the boxed plants or acquisitions, do I have that right, that's still the number you're thinking this year? And if you continue to kind of grow at this rate, does that number need to go up?","Mark W. Kowlzan","The first part, the number is still accurate. We're still looking at that type of spend on boxed plant side. And again, we reserve the ability for Tom. If he comes forth with some great opportunities on acquisitions, we can discuss that matter with the board in a real time manner. At the same time, from a specific customer base opportunity, organic growth opportunity, we have the ability to support capital and growth in that manner, so, but the $50 million is still on plan right now.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Okay, final question, it's just with the April price hike. What are you hearing from customers in terms of light weighting? Are you hearing any accelerated appetite or desire for light weighting, given on the back of the second price hike now in 7 months?","Mark W. Kowlzan","That light weighting, that's not even in the equation. We don't hear that in our discussions. Tom, do you want to add anything to that?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","That's absolutely correct, Mark.","Operator","Next question comes from Philip Ng from Jefferies & Company.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","A longer-term question, you guys have done a phenomenal job, outpacing the market from a gross standpoint on very consistent basis for some time now. But your mills are running very full-out right now and its creep capacity is closer to 1%. It would seem like you have to potentially stunt your growth down the road. I'm just curious, do you have any other growth projects in place that could de-bottleneck some container board capacity down the road?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Two parts to that question. Obviously, we'd lend in the commentary the ability to rationalize our export business where we need to supply the domestic piece of the business. And then it's a matter of capital.  We stated this before, on various calls, how much investment do you need to make and are you willing to make for a ton of production. And so that's always on the table. And that opportunity always exist.","Paul T. Stecko","Okay, and just to add to that, we stated very clearly 2 years ago, our #1 priority is to increase our integration level from the low 80s to the low 90s. And we're working on that and we're not there yet, so we are not going to lose sight of that goal.  And so in terms of de-bottlenecking mills, if the return was really attractive, yes, we've got some opportunities but that's not going to get in the way of our integration level goal.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then from a growth versus M&A, at least on the bolt-on side, how quickly did it take for you to bring on some of these organic projects just because we're getting close to the midpoint and you've obviously laid out, set forth $50 million give or take for some of these projects.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Well, again, we said this on prior calls, both on the box plants and the mills, we always maintain a portfolio of opportunities. And we visit that during various times of the year, we look at the current opportunities and update that list and talk to the various group managements on where they see their needs and opportunities. So we always have a portfolio that can be acted upon very quickly and then brought to bear.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And I guess just one last final question. Q1, you guys kind of mentioned how mix was better than expected, part of that was seasonal. Should we expect some of that mix benefit you saw in Q1 fade over the course of the year?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Tom, do you want to comment?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","Well, I think basically the part of the mix did improve. There's a part that's going to be pretty steady, they will continue throughout the year. And then there's a part that is seasonal. And as Paul alluded to earlier, it's very difficult to really break all those out and to be able to determine exactly what's what. But I think you've got a portion that will continue and you've got certainly a reasonable portion that is mix related.","Operator","Next question comes from Mark Wilde from Deutsche Bank.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just 1 follow up here. If you look back over the last 15 years to when the company was LBOed, it just seems like the business has become more stable, kind of across the economic cycle. I just wonder if that's leading you to make any changes and how you think about managing the business or how you think about the right capital structure for the business?","Paul T. Stecko","Yes, Mark, let me take that. You bring up a very, very interesting point and that is what's going to happen. Let's look a decade in advance. And I kid Mark and Tom a little bit. You guys, this next decade is going to be a lot better than the one that I had in 2000 until 2010, because corrugated growth is obviously stagnated for that decade, but we're very optimistic about the next decade. If the U.S. is going to get out of its employment dilemma, it's unemployment dilemma, I should say, the huge deficits. We think the only way that can happen is better economic growth in the U.S. Some rebirth to manufacturing and there's anecdotal evidence that, that's going on all over. And if we're right, that bodes well for the next decade in corrugated, then that will modify some of the things that you need to do going forward. And we're also strong believers in the fact that if China continues to grow, the world is going to run out of recycled fiber and we like our position of being a virgin producer. That bodes well for us, both domestically and internationally. And so a lot has changed in those, it's not quite 15 years, but it's getting up there. And we think it's for the better for the industry. So that will make some changes. And that's one of the things that Mark and Tom recognized, spend a lot of time talking about. Not so much the short term, but where we're going to be at the end of the next decade. Not that we have specific plans we like where we are, but there's some issues that we have to plan for and deal with. But our feeling is the next decade, for not only us, the entire industry is going to be a lot better in the decade, from when we went private in '99 to 2009. That was a tough decade.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Would you agree that it does seem like the business has become a bit more stable across the cycle?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Absolutely.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Mark W.

Your host today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chief Executive Officer of PCA. Upon conclusion of his narrative, there will be a question-and-answer session. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kowlzan, and please proceed when you are ready.","Mark Kowlzan","Good morning and thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's fourth quarter and full-year earnings release conference call. I am Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA, and with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs our Packaging Business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer.","I will begin the call with an overview of our fourth quarter and full-year results and then turn the call over to Tom and Bob, who will provide more details. I will then wrap things up and will be glad to take questions. Yesterday we reported fourth quarter net income of $111 million or $1.17 per share. Fourth quarter net income included special items of $5.5 million for acquisitions-related costs and facility closure and restructuring costs. Excluding these special items, fourth quarter 2016 net income was $116 million or $1.23 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 net income of $105 million or $1.08 per share.","Fourth quarter net sales were $1.5 billion in 2016 and $1.4 billion in 2015. Total company EBITDA for the fourth quarter excluding special items was $293 million in both 2016 and $265 million in 2015.","We also reported full-year earnings excluding special items of $462 million or $4.88 per share compared to 2015 earnings excluding special items of $443 million or $4.53 per share. Net sales in 2016 were $5.8 billion compared to $5.7 billion in 2015. Excluding the special items, total company EBITDA in 2016 was $1.2 billion, compared to $1.1 billion in 2015. Details of special items for both fourth quarter and full-year 2016 were included in the schedule that accompanied our earnings press release.","Fourth quarter 2016 earnings per share, excluding special items of $1.23, were $0.15 per share above the fourth quarter of 2015, driven primarily by higher containerboard and corrugated products volume of $0.16; higher white papers prices and mix $0.03; lower fiber costs $0.06; and lower annual outage costs $0.09. These items were partially offset by lower containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix of $0.04; lower paper volume of $0.04; higher costs for labor $0.02; and repairs $0.02; higher expenses for depreciation $0.02 and interest $0.01 and a higher tax rate of $0.04.","Our earnings were $0.08 per share better than our fourth quarter guidance. Higher volumes in both our Packaging and Paper segments contributed to about $0.04 per share in total. Operational excellence across all mills and corrugated plants contributed another $0.06 per share, and fiber and chemical usage in the containerboard mills was $0.02 favorable. These items more than offset the lower-than-forecasted price and mix for containerboard of $0.02 and white paper to $0.01 and higher recycled fiber costs of $0.01.","Looking at our Packaging business, EBITDA excluding special items in the fourth quarter of 2016 of $259 million, with sales of $1.2 billion, resulted in margins of 22% versus last year's EBITDA of $252 million and sales of $1.1 billion or 23% margin.","For the full-year, excluding special items, Packaging EBITDA was $1.02 billion with sales of $4.6 billion for a 22.2% margin compared to the full-year of 2015 EBITDA of $1.1 billion with sales of $4.48 billion or a 22.5% margin.","Operationally the containerboard mills ran exceptionally well with record production of 962,000 tons, driven by the need to support record box shipments and the rapid integration of our new corrugated plants from the TimBar and Columbus Container acquisitions. We ended the year with containerboard inventories including the inventory needs of our two acquisitions flat with last year's levels. Inventories were up about 17,000 tons from the end of the third quarter due to the addition of our acquisitions and to prepare for outages at our three largest mills during the first and second quarter this year.","Additionally excellent fiber and chemical usage offset price inflation we experienced in these areas during the fourth quarter.","I'll now turn it over to Tom, who will provide more details on containerboard sales and our corrugated business.","Tom Hassfurther","Thank you, Mark. In Corrugated products, we set new all-time shipment records both in total and per workday with total shipments up 9.7% or 11.5% per workday over last year's fourth quarter. Our outside sales volume of containerboard was up almost 5,000 tons versus last year's fourth quarter and about 11,000 tons below the third quarter of this year. Overall Packaging segment volumes contributed about $0.16 per share above last year's fourth quarter.","For the full-year, shipments in total were up 5% or 4.6% per workday over 2015. Packaging segment price and mix was lower compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 by about $0.04 per share but up $0.05 per share compared to the third quarter of 2016 as we began implementing the announced price increases to our containerboard and corrugated products customers throughout the fourth quarter.","Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.02 per share below the fourth quarter of 2015, but up $0.05 per share compared to the third quarter of 2016. Export containerboard prices were down about $0.02 per share below fourth quarter 2015 levels and fairly flat with the third quarter of this year.","Finally I would like to add that our recent acquisitions have bolted on seamlessly during the fourth quarter. These operations have proven to be an excellent bet and we\u2019re off to a great start towards achieving our goals. Of course this could not have been accomplished without the outstanding effort and dedication of all employees of PCA, including our newest teams from TimBar and Columbus Container.","I'll now turn it back to Mark","Mark Kowlzan","Thank you, Tom. Looking at our Paper segment, EBITDA excluding special items in the fourth quarter was $50 million with sales of $254 million or a 20% margin, compared to the fourth quarter 2015 EBITDA of $28 million and sales of $273 million or a 10% margin.","The EBITDA improvement over last year was primarily due to excellent operational effectiveness throughout the quarter and our Jackson Alabama mill being down for an extended period for a planned rebuild of the recovery boiler with reduced production and increased operating cost during the fourth quarter of 2015, versus no scheduled outage in this year's fourth quarter.","Paper segment price and mix was higher than the fourth quarter of 2015, contributing about $0.03 per share and flat with the third quarter of 2016. Paper volume was lower compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily due to the previously announced fourth quarter shutdown of our market pulp operations at our Wallula Mill, and down versus the seasonally stronger third quarter of 2016. The reduction of pulp volume from the shutdown was key driver of the decrease in segment sales for the quarter.","Full-year 2016 EBITDA, excluding special items, was $199 million and sales were $1.1 billion or an 18.2% margin compared to full-year 2015 EBITDA of $161 million with sales of $1.1 billion or a 14.1% margin.","I'm now going to turn it over to Bob.","Bob Mundy","Thanks Mark. Compared to last year's fourth quarter, depreciation and amortization expense was $0.02 per share higher. Interest expense was $0.01 per share higher due to items related to recent TimBar acquisition.","Our fourth quarter 2016 effective tax rate of just over 34% was above last year\u2019s due to some one-time benefits received in \u201815 when we filed our 2014 returns. Related to our state tax selections made following the first full-year of owning Boise Inc. Cash provided by operations in the fourth quarter was $213 million after deducting $64 million and cash tax payments and $4 million in pension payments.","Other uses of cash included $100 million to pay for the Columbus Container acquisition; capital expenditures of $86 million; common stock dividends totaled $59 million; and $7 million in term loan repayments. We ended the quarter with $239 million of cash on hand.","For the full-year, cash from operations was a record $801 million and free cash flow was a record $527 million. Key uses of cash for the year included capital expenditures of $274 million; common stock dividends of $216 million; 2 million shares were repurchased totaling just over $100 million; $100 million for the Columbus Container acquisition and debt repayments for the year totaled $37 million.","Regarding full-year estimates, certain key items for the upcoming year. We expect total capital expenditures to be between $310 million to $325 million. DD&A is expected to be about $370 million, of about $12 million over 2016 primarily due to the TimBar and Columbus Container acquisitions.","Pension expense is expected to be $25 million and we expect to make cash pension payments of $43 million. The combined Federal and State effective tax rates for 2017 is expected to be similar to 2016 at just over 34%. Based on our current long-term debt, interest expense in 2017 would be approximately $100 million. The cash interest payments would be about $94 million, both around $7 million about 2016 due to the new term loan from the TimBar acquisition as well as slightly higher assumed LIBOR rates.","Based on current planned annual maintenance outages at our mills in 2017, the total earnings impact of these outages, including lost production, direct cost and amortized repair costs is expected to be $0.51 per share versus the $0.42 per share for 2016. The current estimated impact by quarter in 2017 is $0.09 per share in the first quarter, $0.11 in the second, $0.12 in the third quarter and $0.19 per share in the fourth quarter.","I'll now turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Kowlzan","Thanks Bob. In summary, 2016 was a record year for PCA as we continued to see significant benefits from the DeRidder containerboard mill and white paper mills optimization efforts. We completed the TimBar and Columbus Container acquisitions and fully integrated their volume. We ended the year with containerboard inventories at the lowest levels in two years and box plant cut up set new record.","Dividend was raised 15% making its sixth increases over the last five years for a cumulative total increase of 320%.","Looking ahead to the first quarter, we expect to realize the vast majority of our previously announced Packaging segment price increases, and we expect higher corrugated product shipments resulting from our organic growth, and our two recent acquisition, as well as four more shipping days in the first quarter.","We have had lower containerboard and paper production volume, as we have scheduled maintenance outages on one of our machines at both the Counce and DeRidder containerboard mills and on one of our machines at our Jackson, Alabama white paper mill. We expect higher freight costs as well as higher labor and benefits costs with annual wage increases and other timing related expenses.","We also anticipate continued price inflation on recycled fiber, energy and certain chemicals, and seasonally colder weather will increase wood and energy costs. Considering these items, we expect first quarter earnings of $1.26 per share.","With that, we would be happy to entertain any questions. But I must remind you that some of the statements we have made on the call constitute forward-looking statements. These statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties including the direction of the economy and those identified as Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.","With that, operator, I would like to open up the call to questions please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.","Chip Dillon","Yes, good morning.","Mark Kowlzan","Good morning, Chip.","Chip Dillon","First question is you obviously - it sounds like you did a great job getting the Columbus and TimBar plants into your system. How much of the benefit do you think we've already seen and how much - in other words, how much is left do you think as we look into the first half of 2017?","Mark Kowlzan","As far as benefit from the integration of the tons, we\u2019ve significantly integrated the tons that we had committed to. But again, as we work through the first quarter, there is obviously benefits that will continue to roll in. We're very pleased with the acquisitions. Tom, you want to give some more color to that?","Tom Hassfurther","Yes, Chip, I would just add that in the case of Columbus, we only have one month of Columbus in the numbers for the fourth quarter, so there is some more to realize there. TimBar rolled in very nicely and there is probably a little bit more there, but for the most part we got most of the benefit in the fourth quarter.","Chip Dillon","Okay. And just one quick follow-up. Could you talk a little bit about how the first part of January looked? Often you give us a look as to how the first two days have gone. And then it's interesting today being the last day of January, this at least historically tends to be the high watermark for industry inventories looking at the industry data, and I suppose as you look at your system, how loose or tight does the market feel today versus what you normally would expect to see as we\u2019ve - in January?","Mark Kowlzan","Let me answer the last half of that question and we\u2019ll let Tom give you the first half of your question. For us, the - we\u2019re tight, we have to run hard. We've got the shutdowns. We are coming up placing right now for the first and second quarter. With the integration of these acquisitions, our inventories as I stated were basically a two-year low, and so I would characterize the market as tight for us in particular. And so again, it moves to continue to do well and to run hard and to run very effectively. Tom, why don\u2019t you answer the first part of the question for the first 17 days?","Tom Hassfurther","Yes, Chip, I would say coming out of a very strong fourth quarter, we have a very strong January as well. Organically that's legacy plants we are up about 3% to-date. So we are off to a very good start and demand continues to be very good.","Chip Dillon","Great. Thank you.","Mark Kowlzan","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal.","Mark Wilde","Good morning.","Mark Kowlzan","Good morning, Mark.","Mark Wilde","First, just detailed question for Bob. Bob, can you give us some sense of what that maintenance cost was like in the fourth quarter, just as so as to help us bridge into the first quarter and the rest of the year?","Bob Mundy","Yes, Mark, it was just over $0.11 per share in the fourth quarter.","Mark Wilde","Okay. All right, and then a little bigger picture. I wonder if Mark or Tom, what is your integration level right now once we have Columbus and TimBar fully in the saddle?","Tom Hassfurther","As we indicated on the October call and through some of the other public discussion we had in the fourth quarter, we expected to end the year and to start this year at around 95% integration, and that was cumulative effect of our organic growth and the acquisitions last year, and that's right where we are. We are right about that 95% level, so again we are where we expected to be and we\u2019ve adjusted our business for that and we're looking at how we go forward.","Mark Wilde","Okay. And I guess just along with that, Mark, can you give us some sense of what\u2019s sort of the incremental debottlenecking opportunities might be across PCA system in terms of size, cost, timing, things like that?","Mark Kowlzan","Yes. If you were to think about we've raised the capital estimate for this year, there is some projects that we already identified in the past, as I've said, we're working our files. We pull those and we are beginning to execute. These are - as you can primarily work at the DeRidder Mill and it involves both machines at DeRidder but the work will be done until the annual outages of 2018. But it fits in nicely with our growth platform and how we fully take advantage of the DeRidder mill. And to capital, it's not anyone big item. As we've said before, the smaller amount $10 million, the $5 million, but it's basically enhancing both machines capability to optimize the mill.","We are doing some other work at the mill on energy. We've got another turbine generator that we had wired long with the one that was installed at the I Falls, so we'll see similar benefits on cost take out over the course of the next 18 months in DeRidder. But that's a good example of where we are looking at taking through some nice high return capital with some tons that we can place into the system.","Mark Wilde","All right, that's helpful. Thanks. I'll turn it over.","Mark Kowlzan","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.","Mark Connelly ","Thank you. Mark, two things. There is a lot of light and heavyweight grades of containerboard where you don't really compete, and I'm curious if you see any of those grades as strategically attractive to PCA, or whether you think that as you continue to grow your footprint as you talked about, you\u2019re going to stay in the middle?","Mark Kowlzan","Well, if you look at our grade mix currently, we are participating in just about everything that's out in the marketplace with the exception of the ultra lightweights that would be using some very specialty type applications. And I think we view that as just not a current opportunity. Tom, you can add some color to that, but again I think this discussion we\u2019ve had for the last few years about the size in that market on that super lightweight.","Tom Hassfurther","Yes, I think, Mark, as Mark alluded to, we are not participating in that super ultra lightweight category and there is a reason why and that is because our customer demand doesn't really call for it. If they call for it, I suppose we would take a look at moving in those kind of direction. But I want you to keep in mind one thing that we've been talking about for a number of quarters now and that is that we really are in the performance grades and that's really what we focus on maximizing performance for directly attributing to our customers\u2019 needs and that's how we gear our mill systems. So we really do in essence participate in the great majority of everything but it's on a performance measure basis.","Mark Connelly ","And just one more question, it doesn't appear that trade protection has given white paper producers the boost that some people had looked for. Have you been surprised by the level of competitiveness in those markets even with the improved rate of decline that we saw in 2016, and are you expecting anything better in 2017?","Mark Kowlzan","Mark, the trade case did exactly what we targeted to do. They traded a level playing field with some of the folks that we needed to address. But keep in mind, there has been competition for the last 35 years from all over the world. We'll get cut-size office paper. We could go out and set up grades. We were dealing with the world competition back in the 1980s and 1990s, so nothing has changed. It\u2019s just you have the Asian side of the supply chain now, but imports did drop significantly last year and then they picked back up [indiscernible] and now with the end of the year. But we expected that would happen. At the same time we are pleased with where our volume is. We are pleased with our business. And so like in that trade cases has achieved exactly what we hoped it would achieve.","Mark Connelly ","So you're not looking for a much different in 2017 then?","Mark Kowlzan","No.","Mark Connelly ","Okay, perfect. Thank you.","Mark Kowlzan","All right. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo Securities.","Chris Manuel","Good morning, gentlemen, and congratulations on a very strong finish to the year.","Mark Kowlzan","Good morning, Chris. Thank you.","Chris Manuel","If I could come back to an earlier question, I know you said that organic volumes were up about 3% so far in January but you ran up somewhere between 9% and 11% depending how we wanted to think about today in 4Q. Given you still have that integration going forward of the TimBar and Columbus, is that a unreasonable rate for us to think about at least the first three quarters of \u201817 as you have the extra piece in there and then just continued growth, or how would we think about that 9% to 11% on an organic basis perhaps?","Mark Kowlzan","Yes, Chris, that's our plan. We have the funds that we can put through the system. Tom has got his plan for the year, and so you assume that demand is there and we continue to fulfill that demand. So it's not unreasonable to think that just what we achieved last year, what we are seeing this year. Again it's demand-driven and we are pretty pleased with where we are and we know we can take care of the business for the time being. Tom, you want to add more color [ph]?","Tom Hassfurther","Yes, Chris, the main reason I gave you the legacy organic growth for January is that's when we have real visibility into right now so - and that's probably the most meaningful number. You can tack on obviously TimBar and Columbus to that number and then you can get to the number that you can forecast going forward. So we want to emphasize the growth that's going on in organically and that should get represented across our entire system. And so you're probably looking at 10% to 11% as the - if you tack on TimBar and Columbus part of that 3% number I gave you.","Chris Manuel","Okay, that's helpful. That's what I was looking for. As a follow-up question, from where you sit today, the balance sheet is in great shape, you\u2019re roughly 2x leverage. How do you think about a balance through the rest of the year? You gave us your capital plan but I know you always look at the dividends, but how do - you\u2019re thinking about incremental opportunities for on the box side. Are you thinking about maybe there is the share repurchase here, how do you think about incremental opportunities from here?","Mark Kowlzan","I think you just said it all. We will remain opportunistic in all opportunities that we see whether it's being mindful of paying down some debt, acquisitions that came along that were great opportunities such as Columbus Packaging or TimBar, an opportunity to acquire a mill and expand containerboard capacity. We've purposefully set this balance sheet up to have this flexibility to do what we require to do and continue delivering value for the shareholders and continue growing the value proposition.","Chris Manuel","Okay, thank you. Good luck guys.","Mark Kowlzan","Thanks. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies.","Philip Ng","Hi guys. Demand was obviously quite strong for you in the fourth quarter as well as the industry and January seems off to a good start. Just want to get your view on how you're thinking about box demand this year, and are you expecting a stronger demand throughout 2017. What are some of the key drivers? Are there any end markets that really stand out for you?","Mark Kowlzan","Tom, go ahead and put some color on that.","Tom Hassfurther","Well, I would say, Philip, we could predict the quarter given the indicators and how they\u2019ve started out, what goes ongoing forward is anybody\u2019s guess however. If the administration does some of the things they\u2019ve talked about doing and with all our focus right here in the United States, that probably bodes quite well for PCA in terms of demand going forward. End markets, I think there was some discussion about e-commerce on our last call and what it might mean to the fourth quarter, and I think you see those statistics that e-commerce did set reference beyond what the expectation was in the fourth quarter. I think the entire industry was helped by that.","We don't have a tremendous exposure to that area. Ours are more a third-party but nonetheless that probably helps us as well, and I think the prospects going forward are quite good, and like you said, we\u2019re off toward a [indiscernible].","Philip Ng","Okay. That's good color. And then just looking at the December industry data, operating rates are in that 97% range. And Mark I think you mentioned you're pretty tight and obviously Pensacola - it's anybody's guess how long it's going to be down. That is going to take another one-odd-percent of capacity out of your market. Just curious are you seeing any change in behavior from order patterns from your customers? Are they kind of ratcheting orders and doing little pre-buys just because we are going to head into time where there is a lot of downtime being taken as well?","Mark Kowlzan","We talked about that in the fall. We didn't see any significant pre-buy, so I\u2019d characterize that as a no, and I think the market is priced looking again what we have to run fall as I said. Tom you want to elaborate?","Tom Hassfurther","I would just say there are virtually no opportunities for pre-buy.","Philip Ng","Okay.","Tom Hassfurther","The funds are available.","Philip Ng","Okay. All right, that's helpful. And then just one last one from me. You guys obviously baked in some inflation sequentially in the first quarter combination of recycled fiber prices, energy and stuff of that nature. Can you provide some color what the sequential year-over-year hit will be and when we think about fiber collectively, just given your mix in virgin versus recycle, are you expecting a year-over-year headwind just because I think virgin prices at least comp pretty favorable in the first half? Thanks.","Mark Kowlzan","Yes, let me just start that and then I\u2019m going to turn it over to Bob. He can walk you through bridge between first quarter of last year and the first quarter this year just to help you understand that we\u2019re self-inflation driven [ph]. Obviously recycled fiber is up somewhere 45% year-over-year. To remind everyone, we still remain at least impacted in total. We use about 20% OCC PLK combination. So we\u2019re impact $0.20 on the dollar compared to everybody else, so there is an impact but it's smaller - much smaller compared to rest of the industry.","With that, Bob, why don\u2019t you give some color in terms of some of the other line items inflation effect?","Bob Mundy","Yes, Phil, it's the our input costs certainly over last year's first quarter what we are expecting, we\u2019ve been seeing at the latter part of \u201816 and we'll see it in as we go into \u201817 but $0.12 plus per share over last year's first quarter on recycled chemicals, energy, some of those things that we\u2019re all thinking about, and on top of that we expect freight costs to be up a bit and then we always have labeled benefits that go up every year, and so that will certainly be slightly higher than it was last year first quarter as well.","Philip Ng","Okay, great. Thanks for the color.","Mark Kowlzan","Okay. Next question please.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Deborah Jones with Deutsche Bank.","Deborah Jones","Hi. Good morning.","Mark Kowlzan","Good morning, Debbie.","Deborah Jones","I just wanted to follow-up on Phil\u2019s question related to fiber. You did call out the $0.06 benefit but also that OCC prices were higher. So can you talk about really how you got the benefit on the wood fiber side, and then specifically if there is any usage uses benefit or utilization that helped you and if that will continue?","Mark Kowlzan","Bob, why don\u2019t you go ahead?","Bob Mundy","Yes, Debbie, the fiber is - again that\u2019s company, for the total company it was $0.06 but when you look underneath that certainly recycled fiber for the Packaging segment primarily due to inflation was $0.06 per share higher over last year\u2019s fourth quarter. It was just happened to be offset by we had good usage on the paper side and good usage in our virgin wood fiber as well on the Packaging side. We are also doing some things with fiber on the paper side relative to less recycled pulp at our target Jackson mill which is saving us a lot of cost. So net-net we are $0.06 favorable but when you look underneath you can see that it really was impacted the Packaging segment.","Deborah Jones","Okay, thanks. So that\u2019s helpful. And then Mark, my second question just on price mix. I think you said the $0.04 headwind in the quarter was actually below target in your prepared remarks. Can you just confirm what you meant by that, because it was actually pretty big improvement from the year-over-year results in Q3. Just how that's trending in the quarter?","Mark Kowlzan","Well, look, again we talked on the third quarter call on October about the price leakage that had occurred year-over-year through the year 2016. And so as we went into the fourth quarter, we continued to see the impact of the price decline that had occurred earlier in the year on year-over-year benefit. Now that was against - as we started raising prices, we saw the net benefit of price increase.","Bob, you want to elaborate on that? So really it was a lagging event and then the benefit of the price increase starting to roll in.","Anything else Debbie?","Deborah Jones","No, it\u2019s good. I'll turn it over. Thank you.","Mark Kowlzan","Okay, thank you. Next question please.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.","Mark Weintraub","Thank you. Congratulations on a very good year. And maybe just following up on the last one for clarity. I think you mentioned that sequentially that corrugated was a $0.05 benefit 3Q to 4Q, and that the containerboard separately, domestic containerboard was a $0.05 benefit 3Q to 4Q. Did I hear that right?","Mark Kowlzan","Corrugated as a segment. Again we saw the $0.05 benefit but was against some of the leakage that had occurred and that finally netted itself out.","Mark Weintraub","Okay. I'm sorry. I thought you - and maybe I misheard but had you said something about 3Q to 4Q the sequential benefit?","Mark Kowlzan","Yes, on volume, Mark, yes, $0.05 for corrugated domestic containerboard that was the benefit and then export was flat.","Mark Weintraub","Okay, so with $0.05 - and I apologize if I'm getting this wrong [ph], but I thought I heard you say that pricing was a benefit 3Q to 4Q by $0.05, pricing and mix?","Mark Kowlzan","That's correct.","Mark Weintraub","Okay. And that was for boxes and the small amount of board you would be selling?","Mark Kowlzan","And domestic containerboard, yes.","Mark Weintraub","Okay thank you. And then just on the - perhaps a little bit more color on the demand in the fourth quarter. So how much would have the organic growth have been in the fourth quarter, the 11.5% type of year-over-year box shipments improvement you saw?","Mark Kowlzan","Tom, why don\u2019t you walk him through that?","Tom Hassfurther","Mark, the organic growth in the fourth quarter would have been 3.2%. Okay? So again then you take and then add on, then what TimBar and Columbus added to that fourth quarter. Now keep in mind that the first quarter of \u201817 is going to have four more days than the fourth quarter of \u201816. So on a per day basis, the number goes up a little bit in the fourth quarter just because you have fewer days.","Mark Weintraub","Okay. And that 3.2%, that was average day?","Tom Hassfurther","That was per day basis.","Mark Weintraub","Per day, great. And then lastly, I realize that exports are quite small for you, but what are you seeing in the export markets have been a number of price initiatives and the Europeans also announcing price increases for March. Can you give us a little color on what you're seeing?","Mark Kowlzan","Yes. Tom, go ahead.","Tom Hassfurther","Yes, Mark, the export pricing is definitely moving up and demand is quite good. South America is very good this year. So there is - the demand trend even in export continues to be quite good.","Mark Weintraub","Okay, thank you.","Mark Kowlzan","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George Staphos","Thanks. Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for the details. I want to take a step back and maybe go a little bit different direction on the paper segment, the performance at least versus our model, was excellent. You mentioned Mark operationally you did very well. Can you comment a little bit more on what some of the drivers were in that segment because the performance was - certainly you had an easy comp versus last year, but nonetheless was quite good.","Mark Kowlzan","Again we were pleased, volume itself office papers was up slightly year-over-year, so volume was a very good story. But also all of the work we have done over the last three years has continued to be accretive. The turbine generator, we used that example last year, but we continue to work on the white paper mills effectiveness week after week, so throughout 2016 we had our technology organization doing what we do well and that's helping the white paper mills continue to drive costs out and run more effectively. So the big contribution for the fourth quarter as well as the full-year was the fact that volume is up slightly, but also that we were able to take significant costs out by actually all-time record setting uptime efficiencies at the white paper mills.","George Staphos","And with costs being taken out but not necessarily headcount reduction and all that, it was just running better in operational excellence and all things that you normally do.","Mark Kowlzan","Right, it\u2019s I think interesting question. If you look back and look to three years ago, we actually had more people working in the white mills than we did three years ago. And again we are just running a world-class efficiencies, world-class uptime performance month after month. Last year 2016 set an all-time performance record at the Jackson and I Falls mills in terms of their uptime efficiencies.","George Staphos","Okay. So with that as kind of a jumping off point if we go now to corrugated and containerboard and operations, when you're done with the next phase, let's call them, projects at DeRidder and you said you'd be done with that by the outage season in 2018, and recognizing you need to project some growth into the future for this, what do you think your vertical integration rate will be at that point on an annualized basis and what next moves would you likely need to consider? Would they be - would there still be more in the file book in terms of these types of products, or would you need to do something more substantive and perhaps more externally driven?","Mark Kowlzan","George, I think we are at a point now, once you're at 95% integration and were working on these projects to take care of our organic needs, we have opportunities. We\u2019ve said this fact that you can - depending on the amount of capital you want to spend, you can add capacity. So if it\u2019s a capital versus benefit price analyses. But at the end of the day we are fine for the time being. We are right back where we were in 2012 period looking at this type of high integration level and how we go forward. Obviously over the next few years, we\u2019re going to have to make some different decisions on how we set the growth platform for higher level but we will talk about that when we\u2019re ready.","George Staphos","Understood. I appreciate the color there. Last thing and I'll turn it over. Is there any way you could perhaps give us your views on what you think the administration's potential policies might mean for the business broadly whether you think it'd be more net positive or net challenge? Tom, you mentioned perhaps that we could see some pick up the domestically, I don't know, if there is anything specifically that you were pointing to or more aspirational in terms of if we see GDP growth picking up, but if you could give us a bit of color there, that would be appreciated. Thanks and good luck in the quarter guys.","Tom Hassfurther","Yes. It\u2019s demand-driven and demand is tied to GDP pretty significant once again. And so I would just say that if GDP grows in any meaningful fashion, you will see box demand, box cut-up move in that same trend line. So your guess is as good as mine in terms of what actually happened, so I think we are believing that we are better positioned in terms of we are still American-based manufacturing, and so far our customers here in the United States are in that regard would like to wait and see what Washington finally does.","George Staphos","So it's more of a demand versus trade point of view you're making. Correct?","Tom Hassfurther","Yes.","George Staphos","Thank you.","Mark Kowlzan","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup.","Anthony Pettinari","Good morning.","Mark Kowlzan","Good morning, Anthony.","Anthony Pettinari","Following up on the CapEx guidance with the new acquisitions, Bob, I was wondering what we should think of as PCA\u2019s normal maintenance CapEx? And then just following up on George\u2019s question on debottlenecking at DeRidder. You said that work would be done until maintenance outage season in 2018. I was wondering if it was possible to put a finer point on that in terms of the quarter or even the tonnage estimate.","Mark Kowlzan","So let me answer that second part of the question first and I\u2019ll let Bob go back to the breakout between the capital piece [ph]. Because of the long lead items for a few pieces of capital equipments that are required, we'll do this in two phases. We\u2019ll do some of the work on this year\u2019s annual average at DeRidder through the winter and spring period and then we have to wait to fully capitalize on that for some of the equipment to be delivered at the end of this year into early next year to install some of the equipment, and then fully take advantage of our plants. I don\u2019t want to call out the incremental capacity. All I would say is that it allows us to continue the growth trajectory that we have plans to look for the next two years.","Bob Mundy","Yes, Anthony, and then the first part of your question for what we have planned for 2017, as far as the non-discretionary maintenance type items in our capital, it's about 50-50. It\u2019s about 50% is what we would call non-discretionary type spending.","Anthony Pettinari","Great. That's really helpful. And then just switching gears, Pulp & Paper Week has indicated they will roll out a list price for recycled liner I think in March. In terms of how you engage with your customers, is that list price, is it positive, is it negative, is it neutral, or is it just a non-event. Any kind of general thoughts on that?","Mark Kowlzan","Just a quick statement. We\u2019ve said before that appeared as though recycled pricing had been used in the past as a rationale to take down craft line board and medium, and as we know there is a significant difference, as Tom mentioned earlier, in terms of performance characteristics between recycling craft as they are essentially two very different products when it comes to performance. So in that regard, I think what's been talked about probably makes sense to have two different price points. Tom, you want to ahead?","Tom Hassfurther","I've got nothing else to add.","Mark Kowlzan","Anything else?","Anthony Pettinari","No, great. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.","Mark Kowlzan","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays.","Scott Gaffner","Thanks. Good morning.","Mark Kowlzan","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Gaffner","Question is maybe for Tom. I guess if you look at 4Q box shipments obviously very strong both for PCA and for the industry, but if you look at industrial production of non-durable goods which shipments have tracked fairly closely recently over the last few years, it was actually down in the fourth quarter. Is there - Tom, you mentioned e-commerce. Anything else that you're seeing that would account for the stronger than non-durable goods, industrial production shipment?","Tom Hassfurther","No, Scott. I don't think there is anything in particular. I mean, e-commerce obviously is enormous in the fourth quarter. It\u2019s the by far the biggest quarter of the year, so that probably helped to offset a little bit on that. But the other thing is, is that I get a lot of questions about our customers replenishing inventory and things like that. For now for a number of years, our customers have maintained their inventories at very low numbers, so I don't see any replenishing of inventories either, which is good news because that means this demand trend can continue on. And there is probably just a seasonal disconnect would be my guess on the non-durable side.","Scott Gaffner","Okay, fair enough. And Mark, you mentioned obviously the capital projects over the next, call it, 12 to 14 months, some debottlenecking et cetera, but when you look further out, are there any significant investments you could make in the system that you have today without actually going out and adding through M&A, or through any large projects? Is there anything else, maybe at DeRidder or anywhere else in the system to add capacity?","Mark Kowlzan","Well, again without giving you any details, there is always capacity that could be increased. It just depends on how much capital we choose to spend and then it becomes a decision on where is the best place to apply that capital. So we've got some decisions to make as we go forward over the next two years. Again but I\u2019ll reiterate it\u2019s the same place we were in 2012 and evaluating a runway through our containerboard supply. I look at it - it\u2019s a high class place to be.","Scott Gaffner","Sure. Okay. Last one for me, just you mentioned to earlier question in the prepared remarks, you had $0.05 of positive price sequentially into the fourth quarter. When you look at 2017 now, and now that you\u2019ve got the pricing increase fully implemented, what are you thinking price versus inflationary, some of these inflationary pressures that you have? Do you have enough price to offset the inflation that you've already seen in the system going into 2017?","Mark Kowlzan","I'm not going to answer that absolutely, but if you look at our performance historically, given our capital application and how we run the mills and how we run the box plants, we go to market, in general we have been able to keep up with inflation and go up or do better than inflation with cost take out and organic volume growth acquisition contributions. And so that will continue to be our plan.","Scott Gaffner","Okay, thanks Mark. Thanks guys.","Mark Kowlzan","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Maguire","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Mark Kowlzan","Good morning.","Brian Maguire","Just wanted to dig into the 2017 outlook a little bit more. I appreciate all the color you give. It sounds like from the $1.26 or so starting point in the first quarter, you're looking for maintenance to be sequential headwind throughout the year. Just wondering what offsets you\u2019d have that would cause the EPS to go higher through the year? I know normally you\u2019d get some seasonal pickup, but sounds like you're going to be starting the year off from a pretty full volume run rate. Just trying to get a sense of what the other tailwinds would be in 2Q and 3Q as we go through the year?","Mark Kowlzan","Obviously containerboard volume and containerboard price are the big positives and paper price positive year-over-year, and then you would have to say that if again GDP continues to pull the demand, that supports the volume. And then we would have to assume that we continue to do what we do well and that\u2019s operate our mills very effectively to work on the cost side of the equation. So that's pretty much the big pieces right there.","Brian Maguire","Do you think you would have the incremental tons to meet that better demand given how well you ran in 4Q and seems like the 1Q guide assumes a pretty good run rate, or do we have to wait more to 2018 when the DeRidder debottlenecks come online to get some more tons?","Mark Kowlzan","We\u2019re confident. We\u2019ve got options. We got mix changes within our very flexible manufacturing system. We still got the exports and domestic volumes as we continue to assess the value that we derive per ton sold. And so again we\u2019ve got various options and we\u2019re confident we can supply that organic need as we could anticipate into next year. So we\u2019re feeling pretty good about where we are.","Brian Maguire","Okay. Just a related question. Just wondered if there is any opportunities to given the tightness in the market and the strong demand you're seeing, any opportunities to shorten or push out the maintenance at Counce or DeRidder? I know those have to be on a pretty consistent timeline but just given the tightness in the market and with the Pensacola mill outage, just wondering if there is - if you\u2019re seeing any opportunities to maybe defer some maintenance to take advantage of the market.","Mark Kowlzan","We are pretty well set on the maintenance plans. Again when you look year-to-year on what you have to do with those big integrated mills, the plan is pretty well get set and you have a basic high confidence of inspection requirements. And so in that regard, we don't see any changes that the plant is coming up.","Brian Maguire","Okay. Thanks very much.","Mark Kowlzan","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with Roe Equity Research.","Gail Glazerman","Hi, good morning. I know OCC is not a huge expense for you, but I'm just wondering, can you give some insights into what you think has been driving OCC, whether it\u2019s China, whether there has been some talk of domestic collection issue, and are you seeing any signs of stabilization?","Mark Kowlzan","Again just you read everything we read in the indices in terms of greasy [ph] information. So actually China got back big into the marketplace last year. And then demand, again just domestic containerboard activity in the mills and the utilization here domestically is caused the uptick in demand. So I think again it's demand-driven here in the United States and then with China picking up their own requirements. Tom, do you want to add some color to that?","Tom Hassfurther","Well, I would just add Gail that we've been talking for quite sometime that collection rates during start are very high numbers and then of course we had a little decline in collection rates. Some of that\u2019s related to the e-commerce issue we just talked about where boxes are going to consumers\u2019 homes and if their municipality doesn\u2019t collect, they choose not to recycle. Some of those boxes end up in landfill as opposed to go to recyclers. Also the price has ticked down to a point where some of the municipalities chose to get out of the collection systems. So you\u2019re finding that there is just - there is a bottom to this thing which makes good sense and of course coupled with China who is out of the OCC market for quite sometime with very large inventories, lender inventories run down to almost nothing. And so they are very active back in the market and can't - quite frankly can't even get everything they need. So going forward, we look at OCC as being a headwind and I think the price will continue to move up.","Gail Glazerman","Okay. You didn't call it out, so I'm assuming it wasn't an issue but there have been a few headlines about it, some storm activity around Valdosta. Any issues to impact the quarter with supply moving forward?","Mark Kowlzan","No. We've not had any issues at Valdosta, no, regarding any storm outage impact and\/or wood availability or pricing impact.","Gail Glazerman","Okay. And just on - I know obviously you\u2019re full up and at this point absorbing TimBar and Columbus are probably the priorities. But just can you talk a little bit about the M&A landscape particularly maybe on the converting side just as critical math of integration continues to gain. Are you seeing any more or fewer opportunities out there? I mean at this point are the last remaining independents pretty resolute or maybe thinking more and more about getting out just given how many of their competitors on the independent side have?","Mark Kowlzan","Tom, why don\u2019t you\u2026","Tom Hassfurther","Yes, I would say that we've talked before that as the independent market continues to shrink quite dramatically that the opportunities of course in sheer numbers are less but there are still good quality opportunities out there and those that are interested and those that we have relationships with et cetera, we are going to take a good hard look at. So we'll still be active in that M&A arena, and we\u2019ll acquire those that make good sense and fits the criteria that we've laid out before.","Gail Glazerman","Okay. Thank you.","Mark Kowlzan","Okay. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Coleman with Argus Research.","David Coleman","Hi, good afternoon. With regard to your mention of 2% organic growth, I was wondering if you could give some color on a few of your largest top line growth drivers.","Mark Kowlzan","We don't get into details of our customer base. That's proprietary information.","David Coleman","Okay. You did mention\u2026","Mark Kowlzan","And also you talked about the amount, the organic is actually 3%.","David Coleman","Okay. You did mention though that you don't have a tremendous exposure to the online retail sales, but what is your definition of the tremendous exposure I guess.","Mark Kowlzan","Well, again, David, we are not going to get in those details but I did say that our exposure is more in, what I'd call, third-party as opposed to what you might consider to be the traditional e-commerce providers. So having exposure but it\u2019s not in some of your more traditional markets and I\u2019ll leave it with that.","David Coleman","Okay. Just to clarify, so the majority of your products are not used in sending products to the end-user?","Mark Kowlzan","That would be fair to say.","David Coleman","Okay. Thank you.","Mark Kowlzan","All right, thank you. I think we have time for one more question operator.","Operator","You do have a follow-up from the line of Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal.","Mark Wilde","Yes, just a couple of smalls ones. One for Bob. One for Tom. Bob, can you give us a sense of what your cash tax rate is likely to be in 2017?","Bob Mundy","It should be just above - I think we\u2019re up 34% - 34%, 35% somewhere in there Mark.","Mark Wilde","All right, so pretty close to the reported rate then?","Bob Mundy","Yes.","Mark Wilde","Okay. All right. And then Tom, just to be real clear on sort of how pricing rolls through, would you assume if we look at the second quarter that there will be any sort of quarter to quarter carryover benefit from price or will you get most of your price early in the first quarter, so that there is not really much quarter-to-quarter shift as we go into the second?","Tom Hassfurther","Mark, as we mentioned and as the best we can educate that the vast majority of the increase goes in the first quarter of that. That said, we do have some contracts that rollover on a quarterly basis or a midyear basis, so there is a little lead over [ph].","Mark Wilde","Okay, that\u2019s fair. Good luck in the first quarter and through the year guys.","Mark Kowlzan","Thank you, Mark. Appreciate it. And with that operator, we\u2019re out of time. I appreciate everybody taking the time to be with us today and look forward to talking with you after the first quarter results are in for the April call. Have a nice day.

Your host today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chief Executive Officer of PCA. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the conference call over to Mr. Kowlzan, and please proceed when you're ready.","Mark Kowlzan","Good morning, and thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's first quarter 2019 earnings release conference call. I am Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA, and with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs the Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. I'll begin the call with an overview of our first quarter results, and then I'm going to turn it over to Tom and Bob, who'll provide further details. I'll wrap things up, and then we'll be glad to take any questions.","Yesterday, we reported first quarter net income of $186.8 million or $1.97 per share. First quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.01 per share related to the discontinuing paper operations associated with the conversion of the No. 3 machine at our Wallula to linerboard. Excluding special items, first quarter 2019 net income was $187.3 million or $1.98 per share compared to the first quarter 2018 net income of $146.9 million or $1.55 per share. First quarter net sales were $1.73 billion in 2019 and $1.69 billion in 2018.","Total company EBITDA for the first quarter excluding special items was $371 million in 2019 and $322 million in 2018. Excluding special items of $0.43 per share increase in first quarter 2019 earnings compared to the first quarter of 2018 was driven primarily by higher prices and mix of $0.37 and volumes $0.27 in our Packaging segment, higher prices and mix in our Paper segment of $0.21; lower annual average expenses $0.02 of lower depreciation expense $0.02.","These items were partially offset by lower volumes in our Paper segment primarily due to the exit from the paper business at Wallula of $0.13 and higher operating and converting costs totaling $0.27 per share. These higher costs were primarily due to inflation-related increases with wood fiber and chemical costs, labor and benefits expenses as well as indirect costs such as repair and operating materials, outside services and equipment and building rental expenses.","In addition, we experienced significant weather-related challenges across the company from extremely cold temperatures and flooding that negatively impacted production, fiber, fuel and repair costs for the quarter by approximately $0.06 per share. Results were $0.01 above the first quarter guidance of $1.97 per share primarily due to higher prices and mix in both our Packaging and Paper segments.","Looking at the Packaging business, EBITDA, excluding special items in the first quarter 2019 of $334 million with sales of $1.5 billion, resulted in a margin of 22.6% versus last year's EBITDA of $308 million and sales of $1.4 billion or 21.9% margin. Our containerboard mills established a new first quarter volume record while running our system through demand and managing numerous weather-related challenges across the entire mill system.","Our containerboard production allowed us to maintain our industry-leading integration rate by supplying the necessary containerboard to our box plants, which achieved a new all-time first quarter record for total box shipments as well as shipments per day. We ended the quarter with our inventories in good shape, and we continue to work through our scheduled maintenance outages and service our customer needs in a timely manner.","I'll now turn it over to Tom, who'll provide more details on containerboard sales and the corrugated business.","Thomas Hassfurther","Thanks Mark. As Mark indicated, our corrugated products plants had record first quarter total box shipments as well as shipments per day, which were both up 0.7% compared to last year's first quarter.","Outside sales volume of containerboard was about 33,000 tons below last year's first quarter as we ran our containerboard system to demand, supply the increased needs of our box plants and managed lower export volume.","Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.39 per share above the first quarter of 2018 and up $0.03 per share, compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. Export containerboard prices were down about $0.02 per share, compared to both the first and fourth quarters of 2018.","Now I'll turn it back to Mark.","Mark Kowlzan","Thanks, Tom. Looking at the Paper segment, we had a first quarter record EBITDA, excluding special items, of $55 million with sales of $240 million or an all-time record 22.9% margin compared to the first quarter 2018 EBITDA of $31 million and sales of $269 million or an 11.6% margin.","Market conditions remained favorable during the quarter, and we began implementing our announced price increases. Our pricing mix and sales volume were better than anticipated, and we were able to improve our freight and logistics costs as a result of managing our inventories back to a good level at the end of 2018 after running most of last year on allocation.","Our mill system is running extremely well with an increased focus on our most profitable products. The low revenues compared to last year are a result of the exit from the paper business at our Wallula Mill. As we said a couple of years ago, we felt that we could improve our profitability and margins in the Paper segment by exiting this business at Wallula rather than continuing to allocate people and capital resources to it. And that's exactly what we're starting to see.","I'll now turn it over to Bob.","Robert Mundy","Thanks Mark. We had record first quarter cash generation, with cash provided by operations of $236 million and free cash flow of $157 million. The primary uses of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $79 million. Common stock dividends totaled $75 million, $14 million for federal and state income tax payments, net interest payments of $6 million and pension contributions of $1 million. We ended the quarter with $442 million of cash on hand.","I'll turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Kowlzan","Thank you, Bob. Looking ahead, as we move from the first quarter into the second quarter, in our Packaging segment, we expect seasonally higher containerboard and corrugated product shipments with lower prices as a result of the published domestic containerboard price decreases and lower export prices.","In our Paper segment, volumes should be similar to the first quarter, and we will continue implementing the previously announced paper price increases, but scheduled outage costs will be higher due to the annual shutdown at our International Falls mill.","Across both segments, we anticipate slightly higher freight, repairs and certain fixed costs as well as higher share-based compensation costs due to the accounting treatment of restricted stock.","Energy cost should improve as we move into the seasonally milder weather. Recycled fiber prices should be slightly lower, and our effective tax rate should be lower. Considering these items, we expect second quarter earnings of $2.05 per share.","With that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions. But I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constitute forward-looking statements. The statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and do involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as the risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC. The actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements.","And with that, Zatanya, I'd like to open the call to questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.","Chip Dillon","Hi, good morning, Mark, Tom, and Bob.","Mark Kowlzan","Good morning, Chip.","Robert Mundy","Good morning.","Chip Dillon","I wanted to ask a couple questions about the white paper business, which I think had the best quarter we've ever seen since you bought Boise. As we look at the second quarter and then the second half, can you give us an idea of kind of how much of a hit or decline in the second quarter we would see versus the first because of I Falls? And I don't know how much of the price increase you feel comfortable asking us to assume. And then how - would the operations likely bounce back to where they were in the first quarter by the third quarter in that segment?","Mark Kowlzan","I'll let Bob, give you the outage impact costs for the\u2026","Robert Mundy","Yes. Chip, in the second quarter, from the first, there's about $0.06 related to the I Falls outage. And there'll be some additional labor and some other fixed costs that will be up relative to the first quarter. But as we said, pricing - we'll continue to implement the announced price increases as well.","Mark Kowlzan","And then with regard to volume, we expect volume to - as you would look at the seasonal impact, seasonal impact should be moving up as the summer comes on here. Back-to-school will start in the June period. And so volume should be up as we'd expect. Also, we're able to build our inventory, so we'll be able to sell out of our inventories. So in terms of volume, the outage at I Falls won't impact our ability to satisfy the customer demand.","Chip Dillon","So if I hear you, and we decide to assume you got a lot of this pricing, you could actually have sequentially flat or even up earnings in that segment?","Thomas Hassfurther","We'll see. It should be certainly a good quarter though, Chip, relative to our history for sure.","Chip Dillon","Okay.","Mark Kowlzan","And then you have to expect, Chip, with the outage behind us in the second quarter, 3Q, without an outage and again continuing back-to-school-type sales volume, 3Q should - you would expect would be another good quarter in terms of our EBITDA generation.","Chip Dillon","Terrific. And then one other question I had just on that segment is we've seen some - if you could just update us on where we stand in terms of tariffs, et cetera. I know that some of the demand kind of faltered if we look at some of the data in the last couple months. And yet I know that in the past, there have been some trade, I guess, some tariffs put on because of a dumping by other countries. I think there were five involved. And could you just update us on where that stands? Are those tariffs still in place and as a way to impact the U.S. market?","Mark Kowlzan","Chip, for all intents and purposes, the tariffs are still in place. And as you would have expected with the industry announcements earlier in the first quarter with the capacity coming out, customers, quite frankly, had to rely on the imports or the export market from the rest of the world supplying some of their needs. So they did go and seek some of the import capacity to satisfy their demand. Quite frankly, the domestic capacity could not, at that point in time, supply the needs. So we're seeing somewhat of a rebalancing of how the industry's supplies itself in terms of the customer base. So it's not surprising that imports have picked up. That's a natural reaction.","Chip Dillon","And then last question. Mark, as you know, a few weeks ago or last week or so, a major producer down in Brazil announced that they were going to build containerboard capacity using eucalyptus. Although I seem to think that they are making a very lightweight grade, do you have any thoughts about - we've never really seen a hardwood-based containerboard, that I've seen at least, that's been widely usable. And I didn't know if you had any thoughts about that.","Mark Kowlzan","Well, I think you just summarized it. It's short fiber. Traditionally, short fiber does not satisfy the performance requirements of a traditional high-performance demand container. Quite frankly, eucalyptus or mixed hardwoods fall into the category of being able to produce a container that's akin to a folding carton type of Packaging material. So it would be in the lightweight, super-lightweight container, which remind all of you, is a very - the demand is small. The volumes are small worldwide. So it'll certainly, in my mind, be a real niche product.","Chip Dillon","Understood. Thank you.","Robert Mundy","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens.","Mark Connelly","Mark, there was a lot of chatter early in the quarter about PCA losing a big customer, and you clearly aren't showing a lot of signs of distress from that. Can you remind us what your customer base looks like and how you think about individual customer gains and losses?","Mark Kowlzan","Yes. I think on the January call, we talked about that. But primarily, that was business - from our Sacramento Container acquisition. And we talked about that in terms of a competitor had purchased the sheet piece of that business. And so that's some of the business we've been having to make up for. But other than that, that was the big component. Tom, you want to add some color to that?","Thomas Hassfurther","Yes. Mark, I think you're probably referring to the rumor that was going around that it mounted to something like 10% of our volume or something like that. I'm going to remind you, as we've said many times; the makeup of our customer base is 10,000 strong in lots of different industries, lots of different markets. And our largest accounts are, on a relative basis, are a small percentage of our total.","So it's very well spread out, so we don't have anybody even in that category. What Mark was referring to earlier, I think, was we discussed the loss of a couple of large sheet accounts that we had out in Sacramento. And those were purchased by somebody. So as you know, one of those events that you can't help. But it was impactful to Sacramento, but I mean, obviously, in the big scheme of things, you don't see that large impact for us.","Mark Connelly","That's helpful. Just one more question. Can you talk a little bit more about the progress with your new box plant? And you've talked in the last couple of calls about significant number of box plant optimization projects. Can you tell us how that's going to affect your overall system and what it's doing to your integration levels?","Mark Kowlzan","First part of your question with regards to the new plant out in Richland, we had a little bit of a weather delay starting breaking ground, as you would expect, the Pacific Northwest had some of the worst weather 100 years. But all in all, we're still on schedule for the end of the year start-up and the box plant.","Everything looks good. We're very pleased with the design we've put down. And then for the very first time again, we have a new oversight in terms of we teamed up the mill project management team with the corrugated packaging operational and project team. So we've got quite a formidable group putting this plan together. Tom, you want to add to that?","Thomas Hassfurther","Yes. I would just also add that keep in mind that when we bought Wallula, the box plant there was really stretched for an ability to add any capacity. We did what we could over a short period of time. And we're - so this is all customer-driven. I mean we need more capacity up there to satisfy our customers' needs. We're not - I've said it before it. We're not a build it and hope they will come type of company. We're doing this to satisfy real demand. And any of the other optimization projects that we have are driven by customers or driven by labor markets, where it's a very, very tight labor market and we need to go a little more automation.","Mark Connelly","Super. Thank you, Tom and Mark.","Mark Kowlzan","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Seaport Global.","Mark Weintraub","Thank you. One question is, as a bit of a follow-up, could you provide the outage expenses by quarter this year? I know you mentioned I Falls being 6% more 2Q than 1Q?","Mark Kowlzan","Yes. Mark. There's no different than what we gave on the last call. We expect $0.18 in this second quarter, $0.08 in the third and $0.14 in the fourth. They were about $0.19 in the first quarter this year.","Mark Weintraub","Okay. Thank you. And Wallula, can you give us a sense as to whether or not you are now at kind of full profitability mode on the - with the second leg of the conversion having been completed or whether there is still upside as we progressed through the year?","Mark Kowlzan","We talked about this in January about on a run rate basis. So we've got capacity for the next couple of years to supply the system off Wallula capability. And so we're not at the full run rate, that machine was a modified to produce 100,000 tons a year. And so we are not running to the 400,000 ton a year capacity. That's part of within our statement we talked about running to demand. We're running to supply our needs, but the additional capacity requirements into the future next couple of years will come from the final supply off Wallula.","Mark Weintraub","Great. And then lastly, could you give us a sense of box shipments April to-date?","Thomas Hassfurther","Yes, Mark. Through 15 days - we're up a 0.5% through 15 days. So we're - again, remember these are some - we got some tough comps from a year-ago, especially given the Sacramento situation that I talked about, and also demand was good last year as well. So we're off to a little - what we'd consider to be a little bit of a slow start in April, but we see the second half being a little bit better.","Mark Weintraub","Okay. And had you seen the slowing in March that showed up in the statistics?","Thomas Hassfurther","Yes. Yes. I think a number of factors were baked into March. One is, if you look back a year-ago, I think the - if I recall, I think the March number was up like 6.5%. So it was an incredibly tough comp. Given the fact that the year didn't turn out to be a nearly at anywhere near 6.5%.","You had a lot of weather related issues. We certainly suffered a lot of shutdowns in a lot of our box plants, whether it had to do with snowstorms, polar vortex, flooding, you name it from East Coast to West Coast. I mean it seemed like there was an event going on every week during the month of - well really, I mean February and March, but certainly during March as well.","Mark Weintraub","Thanks for all the color.","Mark Kowlzan","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America.","George Staphos","Thanks. Hi everybody. Thanks for the details. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to piggyback on the discussion on growth in box shipments that we've been seeing and recognizing that April has maybe started off a little bit more slowly. What we've seen the last couple of quarters for you and for others is kind of a good start to the first month of a quarter and then a deceleration the quarter has progressed.","Would you agree with that and would you say that that is just a function of inventory patterns from your customers, maybe a little bit more caution in terms of holding inventory. So people ratchet things down as a quarter comes to close. Any thoughts on that would be helpful?","Thomas Hassfurther","Yes, George. I think given the fact that of course most of our customers and our large customers are global companies. They're reading the same news we're reading. One day things look good and other day globally you hear negative news. So I think there's a lot of - a little more knee-jerk reaction.","I think that's going on right now, especially relative to inventories and we're seeing that same pattern you're talking about, where it starts off. The quarter started off a little stronger and then they kind of tail off and so it's - and we're talking to our customers. Our customers are not talking in terms of negative growths or anything like that. They're still planning to grow their business and they still feel bullish about their business, but they are managing their inventories very, very closely.","George Staphos","Okay. Thanks for that, Tom. Second question I had is just on basis weights and the question comes up periodically on the calls. And Mark, you were talking about earlier in terms of the codeine announcement. Are you seeing any different rate of change on the basis weights being used and the move or not to lightweights in the U.S. based on some views on trying to take content out of the package, trying to use less fiber, the move to perhaps optimize packaging at the ETL level?","What are you seeing in terms of trends there? If anything is discernibly different than what you've seen the last couple of quarters and how do you think this is going to materialize the next couple of years?","Mark Kowlzan","Tom, why don't you go ahead and add some color?","Thomas Hassfurther","George, I'll tell you the trend is to performance. That's where the trend is and that trend bodes very well for us being a virgin-based containerboard system, because we've got better ability with - as everybody knows the long fibers, the formation of the fibers, et cetera. We have a much better ability to meet performance levels with the correct amount of fiber. And that's really where things are headed.","We've talked about recycled in comparison, where you have to throw a lot more fiber added chemicals, et cetera. I think we're in a very, very good spot for where the trends are long-term right now and long-term for the box business.","George Staphos","Okay. Thanks for that, Tom. My last question and you might have mentioned, if you had, I'd missed it, how long do you think it'll take for wood cost in the south in particular to normalize relative to what we've been seeing here because of the weather? Do you think by the time we're done with 2Q, we're back to a normal period? Obviously, it'll to be dependent on the weather, which we can't predict, but any thoughts on that would be helpful. Thanks. And good luck in the quarter.","Mark Kowlzan","George, you answered your own question. We got harvesting season starting here in a month, so all bets are off if we end up with some of the severe southeastern hurricanes and Gulf of Mexico type hurricane or tropical weather activity.","George Staphos","All right. So then I'll take another one. Wisconsin box plant doing okay so far coming up the curve.","Mark Kowlzan","Yes. We are very pleased with that.","George Staphos","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Mark Kowlzan","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays.","Scott Gaffner","Thanks. Good morning.","Mark Kowlzan","Good morning.","Scott Gaffner","Hi, Mark. Tom, you gave us the April numbers. You talked a little bit about what happened actually in 1Q. The polar vortex and I think you mentioned some of the flooding in the Midwest, but can you give us the cadence of how box shipments for you sort of broke out during the quarter at the end of the day or month?","Thomas Hassfurther","I mean we were pretty steady throughout the quarter with the exception of March. I mean, we started out in pretty good shape and felt pretty good about March actually starting out. But then it kind of went into that tailspin and it was very much weather related. And of course, you know, I'm going to remind everybody, when we're down, our customers are down also. And when they're down, I mean, those orders are essentially gone. They're just not producing that day. So when they come back up, it starts production all over again. So wasn't as if we were down and our customers weren't. That's really what the impact was in March.","Scott Gaffner","Okay, fair enough. You mentioned Mark, I think in your prepared comments that freight costs, you thought it would be sequentially higher in 2Q versus 1Q. Are you seeing actual freight rates reaccelerate or what's driving that? Is it different freight patterns?","Mark Kowlzan","It's just some of the seasonal fright increase, fright adjustment timing.","Robert Mundy","And there's some mix in there as well, Scott, depending on when you have outages at certain mills and when you bring them back, there's a mixed factor that goes into that as well.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. And just last one for me. When you look at the outside sales, you said down 33,000 tons. I think that was a year-over-year comment on the outside sales. Was that regionally more difficult in one place versus the other? I mean, we've heard some weakness from customers in the Pacific Northwest. I don't know if it's down or if it's was more in the Southeast. Is there anything, any one region that was affected more than the other?","Mark Kowlzan","The 30,000 tons that you were referring to was the export. And very small amount of domestic, but primarily the bulk of that was the export year-over-year decline. And that was throughout - we shipped 30 some odd countries around the world and we saw that decline all around the world.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. Thanks, Mark. Thanks, Bob and Tom.","Mark Kowlzan","Thank you. Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.","Anthony Pettinari","Hi, good morning.","Mark Kowlzan","Good morning.","Anthony Pettinari","Your two big public competitors typically disclose the amount of market downtime they take if any, you mentioned running to demand in the release. Should we interpret that as you took some market downtime in 1Q and understand that's not something you want to do on a regular basis, but is it possible to quantify that?","Mark Kowlzan","Well, if you just do the math, if you look at what we produce for the first quarter and then, and you know what are our capability is now with Wallula in terms of our system capability. I think you can do the math. We never call out specifically the amount of downtime.","I will say that besides the running Wallula number three to its demand requirements. We did take some downtime at mills like Tomahawk, Wisconsin on the number two machine, which is a smaller machine; and the Filer City, number one machine, which is a smaller machine.","During that polar vortex period when gas was reaching astronomical levels and not only was the price, the spot price going to $150 a unit, but they were also curtailing operations for a few days. So we saw net-net a couple of days of downtime on the smaller machines in the Midwest. Other than that, it was just running the system to demand throughout Counce, DeRidder, just having to push the mills as hard as we might have to.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. That's very helpful. And then just a follow-up question on fiber mix? Can you remind us your mix between virgin and OCC? And with OCC at $40 a ton, can you quantify sort of any opportunity to switch from virgin into OCC sort of at the margin at your mills?","Mark Kowlzan","We're still probably in the recycle 15%, 18% level in terms of the amount of OCC DLK that flows through the containerboard mills. Tom?","Thomas Hassfurther","Anthony, I'll also add that you say, can we make the switch. Not really because we, as I mentioned earlier, I mean we're selling performance base linerboards and we're not going to sacrifice our performance in the marketplace for our customers for what potentially could be a very short-term gain on OCC.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.","Mark Kowlzan","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo.","Gabe Hajde","Good morning, Mark, Tom, Bob. Good morning. You mentioned Tom, I think about having a fairly diverse and customer set and I was curious if you could maybe comment at all what you're seeing in terms of, I guess what came through in the first quarter and\/or an April, if there's any particular end market that stands out to you, sort of asking the question in the context of what we're seeing reports of some substitution, some eCommerce applications. Just curious what you guys are saying.","Thomas Hassfurther","Well, I would there's I mean, typically our markets are pretty steady throughout the year and some are seasonal and some art. But I would say that if there was any one segment that probably is changes on a more regular basis, it would be the eCommerce segment. Of course, we're come out of the fourth quarter, which is very heavy eCommerce. And then you get into the first quarter, which is less.","So there's no question that some of the larger players in there have stated publicly that they're looking for ways to reduce their packaging expenses and have one way trips and things like that. So there's some going on there, but it's still growing, it's still going to be a big, big part of the market. And but that's the one that probably is more impacted.","On the other hand, we've got other segments that could have been in RPC's as an example that are moving back to corrugated, for food safety reasons, for transport reasons, for what it - for a myriad of reasons, including sustainability and environmental. So these markets are very dynamic and you have pluses and minuses all the time. So it's kind of the things we face all the time in this competitive environment.","Gabe Hajde","That makes sense. I understood. I guess you didn't mention anything, Bob, in terms of repurchasing shares in the quarter. Has anything changed on the capital allocation front? Can you comment at all about what the acquisition market looks like in terms of valuations or anything like that?","Mark Kowlzan","Gabe, regarding a share buyback, obviously we didn't call out any shares bought back and a regard to capital. We're still on target for what we talked about in January, a little over 400 million, that hasn't changed. And then Bob, you want to add anything?","Robert Mundy","No, I'd say that the answer Gabe is similar to what we said last call is, we continue to evaluate all of our options. Where do they be, M&A related or dividends or share buybacks or are high return capital and that hasn't changed and that's continued to how - we'll continue to look at it that way for this year.","Gabe Hajde","Thank you. Good luck.","Mark Kowlzan","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal.","Mark Wilde","Good morning.","Mark Kowlzan","Good morning.","Thomas Hassfurther","Good morning.","Mark Wilde","Tom, I wondered if you could give us a sense if you were running Wallula at that 400,000 ton level. What would your current integration Level B?","Thomas Hassfurther","Without doing the absolute math, it puts us back up into 95%, mid 90s area. So we're currently running a low 90s. You move back up into that mid 90s probably somewhere without having done the math yet.","Mark Kowlzan","As I've said before, Mark, we're going to continue to participate with our domestic customers, because we've got some long-term relationships there and with our export market as well. Bob, you want to\u2026?","Robert Mundy","Yes. I was just saying, if you were saying, at current box demand, if that were the case, obviously that would - that that integration rate would go down. We're not going to call out what it would be. But as Mark said earlier, we're running Wallula that's we have runway there for our future and we're certainly running it in a way to match supply with demand. So - but certainly it would go down at current box demand.","Mark Wilde","Okay. And then just thinking a little bit further out, is it possible that you could stretch Wallula beyond 400,000 tons?","Thomas Hassfurther","Yes. If you ever recall, I did mention on the January call that for some - a certain amount of capital, we could spend some more money at Wallula, and stretch the Wallula Mill out to grow that capability.","Mark Wilde","Okay, all right. The last question from me is just when we think about the second quarter guidance. The guidance is essentially flat kind of year-over-year. But you had a containerboard hike last year and you've got a couple of paper hikes. So what are the main offsets when we think kind of just year-over-year in terms of things that are offsetting the benefit from the containerboard and paper hikes? Just the big buckets.","Thomas Hassfurther","Yes. The big buckets, Mark, would be certainly on the paper side. Our volume will be down because of the exiting the release liner business, so that that would be a drag. Fiber costs are certainly higher than last year, for the reasons we've talked about earlier.","And just keep in mind too. As we said, when we with Wallula and W3, we're pulling a lot of real high costs fiber. It just everything - fiber is very expensive out in that part of the country, just like it is for everyone else. And so when you add, the volume we're adding from W3, and the fiber needs for that at a very high cost, then that metric alone is going to go up as well.","Energy costs are up and then just inflation. We have inflation across labor and benefits as normal. But there's also a sizable amount of inflation and things that don't get talked about a lot of around repair materials, operating materials, rents, equipment rentals, building rentals, on and on and on.","And we do have this year in the second quarter, the item we mentioned in the release about the accounting for a restricted stock issuance. It's just an accounting thing that just hits us this second quarter versus last year and it's almost about $0.04 a share. And then of course export prices, export prices are probably, $0.05 or show down from last year's levels as we go look at the second quarter. So those starting the gate that that price improvement we were getting on the paper in the packaging side.","Mark Kowlzan","Yes. In addition, Mark, I just add that, we had the risky move of $10, which came out of nowhere as far as we were concerned. It was a very large surprise. They're citing such a small portion of the market. And quite frankly, we didn't see any of it and we do participate in the outside market. So that was a big surprise to us and those even a $10 movement can be impactful.","Mark Wilde","Okay. Just slip one more. You've got almost $0.5 billion of cash, and it looks like you should be building more cash this year. Is there any kind of upper limit on what you're willing to hold in terms of a cash balance?","Mark Kowlzan","When we get there, we'll let you know. We'll talk about it then.","Mark Wilde","All right. We'll stay tuned.","Mark Kowlzan","All right, that will be a high class situation. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Maguire","Hey, good morning, guys.","Mark Kowlzan","Good morning Brian.","Brian Maguire","Just wanted to follow-up on that last comment you made around the change in, in linerboard prices. I guess my understanding had been you guys are highly integrated, so it would take more like a $20 or $25 cut in the published price before you'd see a material change in your selling prices. So when you talk in the comments around the 2Q guide around the lower prices being a headwind, are you talking specifically around export prices and some of the small sort of merchant open market board sales you're selling or are you actually expecting an impact on kind of box prices and box revenue in 2Q versus 1Q?","Thomas Hassfurther","Well, Brian, obviously, the biggest impact, short-term is going to be export given what's going on in the export market. That's certainly a drag. But even a $10 movement like that took place, I mean, we do have some contracts where that does kick in certainly in our domestic sales and on the box side as well. But regarding box pricing or something, I mean, we never discussed that at all. But it just goes to show that there's been a - as we've talked about in the past, the landscape has changed dramatically in this industry. And I think a lot of people try to speculate about what's going to happen going forward based on what happened in the past.","And structurally, we're so different in this industry and so integrated that I think the - I don't think you can always find the answer in the past for what might happen in the future. And I get concerned about some of the speculation that goes on about what's going to happen with liner and medium prices. When you start talking about other factors, box markets are competitive, they're fluid and liner and medium is kind of a hedge in that market. But they're their own market.","And what's going on there often has no impact, it doesn't result in anything in the liner and medium area. So going forward, I think, I still think that pulp and paper gets it right eventually, but sometimes in the short-term, we may disagree and in this particular case we do. It was a big surprise.","Brian Maguire","Got it. Understood. I just want to get your comment on your inventory levels in the Packaging segment, how you kind of see them versus where it gets like to be. And you mentioned kind of running for demand as you try and adjust those inventory levels to wherever you'd want to be. Would you envision needing to take any economic downtime in 2Q and is that sort of contemplated in the guidance you gave?","Mark Kowlzan","Well, again, using the term running to demand, we still have an outage at DeRidder in June that will take the machine down. And so as we finished up 2018 we knew we had to build some extra inventory to get through the normal outage activity in the first quarter until the early part of the second quarter. And we did that. And so we ended the first quarter right where we want it to and we're in good shape right now. So unless something changes in the economy, we're going to continue doing what we're doing and running in the mode that we're running. So I don't anticipate anything unusual, but again, that's where we are.","Brian Maguire","Okay. Thanks. I'll turn it over.","Mark Kowlzan","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc.","Adam Josephson","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Mark Kowlzan","Good morning.","Adam Josephson","Tom, just one more on - good morning. Tom, just on the demand. I know you talked about the weather in March and to a lesser extent in February, and that adversely affecting demand to some extent. If we go back to say, middle of last year, that's when we started to see the industry growth slowing to about 0.5% or so, which has continued really into March. Are there other factors that you would point to the economy slowing, the ecommerce effect that you talked about earlier? How would you characterize the state-of-box demand today compared to where it was, say, and late 2016 and throughout 2017?","Mark Kowlzan","Well, let me start with that one and then I'll Tom finish up. If you think about last year, think about the news you watched every day in the morning and everything you read throughout the day. I'm talking about the uncertainty with the world economy. You've got the Chinese and North American and United States trade discussions going on.","Europe it's just a lot of uncertainty worldwide with the economy. A day didn't go by that. Some news media was talking about that very fact. And so I think in Tom mentioned this earlier, that whether it's our customer base or customers in general, people are running their business a little tighter right now because of the uncertainty.","And in fact, whether or not demand has slowed, there are segments, auto industries down. So I think there's just a lot of - if you look at European, German manufacturing index down during the first quarter. So there's some actual economic slowdown along with the uncertainty and I think began the some of the trade negotiations or creating some of the uncertainty and the actual slow down so Tom?","Thomas Hassfurther","Yes. Adam, in addition to Mark's comments, what I would say is, I would say a good way to look at this might be that we went through a very fast growth curve in this business do to eCommerce. I mean, everybody knows that it's kind a came out of nowhere and the demand went up dramatically. Ecommerce continues to grow, but it's not growing at the pace it was because it's not starting from infancy anymore, so even that business is becoming a little more mature.","So if you looked at it and you said, well, over time we had this big spike in demand, we're still building on top of that spike of demand, which is good. But right now I think, and even and this was true last year as well. As I said, a lot of our customers are global suppliers and as things began to slowdown in elsewhere in the world that does translate back the box business because all this stuff does shipping a box, when it goes overseas. So those are kind of what I call the headwinds that we have, although I still feel good about the fact that we continue to grow on top of a much larger base.","Adam Josephson","Thank you for all that. Just one follow-up, you start off April 1 of about 0.5%. I know the comp is pretty tough. I think the comp for the industry, I know for you I'm not as sure, but I assume the comp gets appreciably easier in May and June. So in terms of the guidance that you gave for 2Q, are you at liberty to say roughly what rate of demand growth you're assuming for the quarter as a whole?","Thomas Hassfurther","No. We don't really make assumptions on that. We just we go by based on the facts that we know.","Adam Josephson","Thank you.","Mark Kowlzan","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America.","George Staphos","Thanks guys for taking my two follow-on. I'll make it quick. Tom, back to e-commerce, certainly markets like apparel and electronics have been pretty well penetrated. There's some more to go. But there are other markets and there are other avenues of getting product to the consumer, whether it's a food, produce and so on that really haven't been penetrated yet. Recognize that might not necessarily be your key end market.","Do you think there's a potential for e-commerce to see an improvement in the growth rate for corrugated consumption as some of these new markets, which are frankly bulkier and heavier goods, need more cargo or to get them get the product ultimately to the consumer? That's question number one.","Question number two, back to paper. To the extent that you can comment historically, looking back, how long would it take you to get the uncoated free sheet price increase into the market, not expecting - not asking you to tell us this quarter about this increase, but historically, how many months will it take you to get that in? Thank you. And again, good luck in the quarter.","Thomas Hassfurther","Okay. I'll take your first one George, and I'll turn it over to Mark to take the second one on the paper. Yes, as I said, it's still a growth engine. Ecommerce clearly is still a growth engine. I think some of our ecommerce customers that you mentioned food and produce is still a great end market. It's going to require corrugated. It had some difficulty, I think penetrating and getting off the ground. It's not as obvious to a lot of consumers that they can do that and feel good about that. I still think, you know, when it comes to fresh food, I mean, they like to touch it and feel it and pick their own, if you will.","So there's some - there's going to be some difficulties penetrating at like they'd like to, but I think there's going to be a large segment of the market that's going to go for it and they will continue to develop that. So that's clearly an opportunity within the ecommerce area. And there's others as well. They're going to try to make our lives as easy as possible and deliver something in a different way and reinvent the way, the way consumers purchase. And they'll do it in every market they possibly can and most of that will require corrugated boxes and that's good for our industry.","Mark Kowlzan","And then regarding the paper price timing. Historically, if you went back and looked once the index has picked up when you start moving price, it's about a three month period of time on average.","George Staphos","Thank you, guys.","Mark Kowlzan","Thank you. Are there any other questions?","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Mark Kowlzan","Very good. Operators, it sounds if there are no questions, I want to thank everybody for joining us on the call and we look forward to talking with you in July. Thank you.

Your host today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chief Executive Officer of PCA.","[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference call over to Mr. Kowlzan, and please proceed when you\u2019re ready.","Mark Kowlzan","Good morning, and thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America\u2019s Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Release Conference Call. I\u2019m Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA, and with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, our Executive Vice President, who runs Packaging Business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer.","I\u2019ll begin the call with an overview of our third quarter results, and then I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Tom and Bob, who\u2019ll provide more details. I\u2019ll then wrap things up, and then we\u2019d be glad to take questions.","Yesterday, we reported third quarter net income of $139 million or $1.47 per share. Reported earnings include the impact of special items expense primarily related to discontinuing paper operations associated with previously announced conversion of the No. 3 machine in our Wallula, Washington mill to linerboard. Excluding these special items, the third quarter 2017 net income was $159 million or $1.58 per share compared to the third quarter 2016 net income of $123 million or $1.30 per share.","Third quarter net sales were $1.6 billion in 2017 and $1.5 billion in 2016. Total company EBITDA for the third quarter, excluding special items, was $364 million in 2017 and $299 million in 2016. Details of the special items for the quarter were included in the schedules that accompany the earnings press release.","Excluding the special items, the $0.38 per share increase in third quarter 2017 earnings compared to the third quarter of 2016 was driven primarily by higher prices and mix, $0.61, and sales volume, $0.07, in the Packaging segment, and a partial insurance recovery related to the DeRidder Mill incident of $0.02.","These items were partially offset by lower prices and mix of $0.05 and sales volume of $0.02 in the Paper segment. We have higher input costs of $0.12 with recycled fiber, energy and chemical costs, all higher, partially offset by lower wood fiber costs. Operating costs were up $0.03, primarily due to higher labor, repair and converting costs.","We also had higher expenses for freight of $0.02 and annual outages of $0.02 as well as higher corporate and other costs of $0.06 per share, which was primarily higher depreciation and interest expense.","Compared to the third quarter guidance, results were negatively impacted by $0.02 per share due to hurricane-related items at certain mills in corrugated products facilities. And these were offset by a partial insurance recovery related to the DeRidder Mill incident of $0.02 per share.","Looking at packaging \u2013 looking at our Packaging segment, the EBITDA, excluding special items in the third quarter of 2017 of $341 million with sales of $1.35 billion resulted in margins of 25.3% versus last year\u2019s EBITDA of $256 million and sales of $1.17 billion or a 21.9% margin. Higher year-over-year inflation came in close to where we expected, and the employees at our mills and corrugated products facilities did an outstanding job mitigating the negative impact from the recent hurricanes.","Our containerboard mills set all-time quarterly production record of 996,000 tons, reflecting the successful results of our scheduled outages earlier in the year as well as incremental improvements at the DeRidder Mill that we\u2019ve spoken about previously. Containerboard inventories were 7,000 tons above last year\u2019s third quarter, as we plan for continued strong demand in our Packaging segment, while preparing for scheduled fourth quarter outages at our Counce and Tomahawk Mills.","We also began the integration of the Sacramento Container acquisition across our packaging business platform. And we\u2019re also preparing for the first quarter 2018 scheduled outages at 3 of our mills that will significantly reduce our production early next year.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Tom, who\u2019ll provide more details on the containerboard sales and corrugated business.","Tom Hassfurther","Thanks, Mark. Overall, Packaging segment demand remained very strong with sales and production volumes contributing $0.11 per share above last year\u2019s third quarter and $0.07 above the second quarter of 2017. Corrugated product shipments in total were up 4% with 2 less work days or 7.3% per work day compared to last year\u2019s third quarter.","Continued strong demand in both our domestic and export markets improved our outside sales volume of containerboard by about 9,000 tons versus last year\u2019s third quarter and almost 32,000 tons versus the second quarter of 2017. We executed the implementation of our Packaging segment price increases very well during the third quarter.","Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.54 per share higher than the third quarter of 2016 and up $0.20 per share compared to the second quarter of 2017. Export containerboard prices were up over 21% or $0.07 per share above third quarter 2016 levels and up 6% compared to the second quarter of this year.","And I will turn it back to Mark.","Mark Kowlzan","Thank you, Tom. Looking at our Paper segment, EBITDA, excluding special items in the third quarter was $39 million with sales of $271 million or a 15% margin compared to the third quarter of 2016 EBITDA or $59 million and sales of $293 million or 20% margin.","Although white paper sales volume was about flat with last year\u2019s third quarter, overall Paper segment volume was down due to our exit from the market pulp business. Paper volumes were up over 9% in the seasonally stronger third quarter versus the second quarter of 2017.","Similar to the industry published prices, Paper segment price and mix was about 2.5% below third quarter 2016 levels and 1.9% below the second quarter of 2017.","Finally, third quarter results were also negatively impacted by a scheduled annual maintenance outage at our Wallula Mill versus having no outages in last year\u2019s third quarter.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Bob.","Bob Mundy","Thanks, Mark. As mentioned when providing our third quarter 2017 guidance of $1.68 per share, this did not include any potential additional costs or anticipated recoveries related to the DeRidder Mill insurance claim.","During the quarter, we were able to report another partial insurance recovery of $0.02 per share. However, as Mark indicated earlier, hurricane-related items at certain mills and our box plants in Florida negatively impacted the third quarter by $0.02 per share, which gets us back to the $1.68 per share on a recurring basis. There were other small differences in the key items that make up our guidance estimate, but they effectively offset each other.","There\u2019s no change in our estimate range of $20 million to $25 million for the total property damage and business interruption losses, including capital costs related to the DeRidder incident. We ended the quarter with $371 million of cash on hand. Usage of cash included; $103 million for federal and state tax payments, capital expenditures of $87 million, common stock dividends totaling $59 million, pension contributions of $36 million and $2 million in term loan repayments.","Finally, our planned annual maintenance outages for the balance of the year are unchanged from our previous guidance, which reflects a negative impact of $0.12 per share moving from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, resulting in a full year 2017 total impact of $0.51 per share.","I\u2019ll now turn it back to Mark.","Mark Kowlzan","Thanks, Bob. As most of you know, during the third quarter, we announced that we\u2019d entered into an agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of Sacramento Container Corporation. At 100% of the membership interest of Northern Sheets, LLC and Central California Sheets, LLC in a cash-free, debt-free transaction for a cash purchase price of $265 million. We also announced that we will discontinue production of the uncoated freesheet and coated one-side grades at our Wallula, Washington mill in the second quarter of 2018 to begin the conversion of the 200,000 ton per year No. 3 machine to a 400,000 ton per year high-performance 100% virgin kraft linerboard machine.","Earlier this month, we announced that we had completed the Sacramento Container acquisition and activities are well underway to optimize and integrate these facilities into our Packaging business platform. Additionally, preparations are on schedule at our Wallula Mill to cease paper production on the No. 3 machine and begin production of virgin linerboard beginning in the second quarter of 2018.","Looking ahead, as we move from the third quarter and into the fourth quarter, we expect Packaging segment demand to remain strong, although at seasonally lower volumes, which includes one less shipping day as well as a seasonally less rich mix in corrugated products. We will also have the addition of our newly acquired Sacramento Container operations in the fourth quarter.","In our Paper segment, we\u2019ve started implementing our recently announced price increases, but expect seasonally lower volumes and a less rich sales mix. While recycled fiber prices should move lower, higher wood and energy costs, along with higher prices for certain key chemicals and higher freight costs are also expected. Finally, as Bob mentioned earlier, we estimate our annual outage cost to be $0.12 per share higher than the third quarter due to scheduled annual maintenance work at two of our containerboard mills and two of the paper mills.","Considering these items, we expect fourth quarter earnings of $1.50 per share. This does not include any potential additional costs or anticipated recoveries related to the DeRidder Mill insurance claim. With that, we\u2019d be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. The statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K that\u2019s on file with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements.","And with that, operator, I\u2019d like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.","Chip Dillon","My first question has to do with \u2013 it\u2019s a little broader one, but historically, you guys have done a great job focusing on the small and middle sized customers maybe relative to some of the other box producers. And I am just curious and as the world becomes more tied to \u2013 or growth because and we are tied to e-commerce, is there any change in that strategy in the sense that you would feel the need to participate \u2013 in order to participate in e-commerce that you would have to get bigger in some of the larger companies that buy boxes?","Mark Kowlzan","I\u2019m going to answer that with no. But I\u2019m going to let Tom provide more color there because it is important. Chip, I would say that \u2013 you know, listen, e-commerce is an important part of the business. And it\u2019s a channel that many of our customers actually participate in. And of course, I think a lot of people and I think about e-commerce, I just think about Amazon, which is somewhere between 40% and 50% of the e-commerce segment. And that\u2019s one way to get products to directly to consumers, but a lot of our customers use other channels as well. So along with Amazon, we participate in many instances, where e-commerce is taking place and I think we\u2019re fortunate again, because we\u2019ve got such a broad-based customer based at \u2013 many of those customers find a lot of different channels to sell-through, including e-commerce. So we\u2019ve been able to grow along with them and growing that e-commerce segment.","Tom Hassfurther","That\u2019s why, Chip, again, the inherently the strategy will change, it hasn\u2019t changed for many years. We just go and take advantage of the market dynamics and the capability we have of approximately 19,000 customers nationwide.","Chip Dillon","Got you. Okay. And then the second follow-up I have is, as we think about conversions and let\u2019s look at Wallula as an example. Obviously, the payback is very quick, which is uniquely something that you can take advantage of that, I suppose, most can\u2019t, but it\u2019s also important to look at the lost revenue that \u2013 or income from what you used to make there. And if you could just help us, as we model 2018 and beyond, how much will you forgo by not running whatever you\u2019re running at Wallula as either pulp or white paper?","And I know you shut down some pulp there last year. And then also, as we think about the quarters, and this might be more for Bob next year. Whether it be kind of any disruption or unusual pressure on the Paper segment income as you\u2019re actually doing the work in the second and fourth quarters?","Mark Kowlzan","Regarding the first part, obviously, we\u2019re exiting that business, the coated business primarily because we\u2019ve seen the declining margins over the last couple of years. And we have the opportunity on the other side of the business being our growth side, corrugated products to take advantage of that mill asset. And so obviously, there will be a decline in the reported revenues and the earnings, but it will be small. Bob, do you want to add a little more color to that?","Bob Mundy","Yes. Chip, as we were saying, with that business and where we were positioned in marketplace and so forth and as we looked out, the margins were certainly going in the wrong direction. So the impact of what we will lose when we convert is not extremely significant. Regarding 2018, yes, for the Wallula Mill, it will be a lumpy year. When you think about the first quarter, maybe sort of business as usual, but in the second quarter, where we have the first outage to begin the conversion, that will be a \u2013 there will be some extra costs, certainly, coming in then and they\u2019ll be coming out of that, we\u2019re running the linerboard.","But we\u2019re \u2013 we still have all the bells and whistles that we want to put on later in the year, so it will be improved, but maybe not at the cost that we ultimately would like to be at. Then we go into fourth quarter outage to finish up the work and then coming out of, again, more costs coming in, but then as we come out of that, that\u2019s when we feel like we will be on the run rate that we \u2013 that meets the expectations that we have built into the project.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets.","Mark Wilde","Tom, I wondered, if you could give us some guidance in terms of your level of integration, once we\u2019ve got kind of Sacramento and as well as those sheet plants. What\u2019s your \u2013 what will your integrations be in, say, the fourth quarter or the first quarter next year?","Tom Hassfurther","Our integration level is currently about 95%, Mark. And even after the completion of Sacramento and then the work at Wallula and when we are up running full at Wallula, we\u2019ll be right back to that 95% integration level.","Mark Wilde","Okay. And then kind of following on that, so it seems like Wallula is buying you, I don\u2019t know, a couple of years of demand growth. But can you just help us think about sort of what the next options might be for you guys in terms of either acquisitions, internal \u2013 other internal conversions just sort of what the \u2013 what the palette looks like?","Mark Kowlzan","Yes, Mark, this is Mark. We\u2019ve been asked that for the last year or so. Obviously, we will continue to evaluate all the options from acquisitions of one-off mills to conversions. And so trust that we are looking at this point frequently and understand what our options are and how we would do that. And so \u2013 and I think I\u2019ve used this term before, that\u2019s our high-class problem as we go forward.","Mark Wilde","Okay. All right. And then the last one from me. Is there anyway, Mark, you can kind of quantify the pressure you expect in the fourth quarter on some of these inputs that you mentioned kind of wood, freight, chemicals. And whether you think like particularly with wood, this is just a kind of transitory issue because of wet weather?","Mark Kowlzan","Yes, on the wood issue, we had a wetter summer in the mid-south region, primarily the Jackson mill impacted. But obviously, with the hurricanes from the August through the September period, all the way from the Louisiana wood basket into the Georgia wood basked, across the board, we\u2019d to deal with wetter weather. So we still got some overhang from that. It\u2019s been continuing to be wet. So unless it dries up, weather changes, we\u2019ll see some overhang on the wood cost in those regions. And then it\u2019s just the year-over-year on general chemical like caustic latexes and others year-over-year. And, Bob, why don\u2019t you add a little more color to that.","Bob Mundy","Yes, yes. So, Mark, we have inflation that is not a lot across freight and wood and chemicals and energy, but there\u2019s certainly some inflation. And there\u2019s also some usage related as you get into the cooler months, some of those items are impacted by the weather that we anticipate. And the other thing is, yes, we will have a benefit from lower OCC prices, but as everyone should know that when prices move, we\u2019re not impacted as much when they go higher and so we\u2019re not getting as much benefit when they go lower. So the net of that is with those \u2013 all those types of inputs including freight is just not a \u2013 it doesn\u2019t move the needle a lot one way or the other.","Mark Wilde","Okay that\u2019s all from the row.","Mark Kowlzan","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America.","George Staphos","Thanks everyone, good morning. Thanks for the detail. The first question I had was on production. So in the quarter, you obviously had a record in the containerboard side, and you did a fair bit better than we were looking for. How much more production can you squeeze out in this period here until Wallula shows up and the remaining project, DeRidder or debottlenecking shows up next year. Can you continue running or have the ability anyway, if there is demand for it to be up 4% or so, 5%? Or are we looking at a narrower gain at this juncture in terms of what\u2019s available?","Mark Kowlzan","Well, this year\u2019s year-over-year production is benefiting from the projects that we\u2019ve called out i.e., the DeRidder improvements on both DeRidder No. 1 and DeRidder No. 3. We said we\u2019d get probably around 50,000 tons benefit this year. And then we\u2019re obviously seeing that. And then the other mills just continued to benefit from our constant attention to detail on improving the efficiencies on an ongoing basis. But if you think about \u2013 if you did an estimate for 2017 versus 2016, we\u2019re going to be up probably a 150,000 tons over last year, and then we\u2019ve got the shutdowns that we\u2019re going to be facing.","So the big opportunity is going to be coming, obviously, from the work at DeRidder during the first quarter annual outage that will take care of some final work on No. 1 and then the remaining work on the wet end of No. 3 machine. And then DeRidder will be behind us after the first quarter and then we just need to get lined out there and so we will achieve the full run rate benefits that we\u2019ve been talking about. And then to the point, we just faced that opportunity of how do we continue to provide the tons and looking at the different opportunities, but \u2013 and I\u2019ve said this many times, we are very mindful of that every dollar of capital spent does have a diminishing return at some point in time. So we are very prudent in how we\u2019d look at where that opportunity comes from.","George Staphos","Okay Mark thank you for that. Can you comment at all in terms of what trends you\u2019re seeing early in the fourth quarter in terms of both box shipments? And for that matter, what you\u2019re seeing in the paper market? And then I had one last follow-on question.","Mark Kowlzan","Yes, let me handle the Paper side and Tom is going to give you the details on the corrugated products. Paper is holding up, as we would expect. We\u2019re right into the fourth quarter typical. The mix has fallen off, as you\u2019d expect. It\u2019s not as rich as you\u2019ve seen in third quarter. You\u2019ve seen some seasonally slower volume and activity with the cut size, in particular and some of the offset during the converting grade. But all in all, we\u2019re where we expect to be. And so from our Paper business, we continue to just move along with fairly flat sales quarter-to-quarter, year- over-year. Tom, why don\u2019t you give some details on that?","Tom Hassfurther","George, in terms of the packaging side of the business and boxes specifically, demand remains very good, very strong. Through 15 days returning 5% higher on a per-day basis and that excludes Sacramento Container, of course. So we\u2019re very pleased with the current level of demand.","George Staphos","Thomas, are you saying that includes or excludes Sacramento in that 5%?","Tom Hassfurther","that excludes Sacramento Container.","George Staphos","Okay. Thank you for that. My last question is \u2013 it\u2019s more around the margin opportunity in corrugated for your longer term. I mean, given our research travels recently, it seems like the e-commerce customers tends to be a bit more service-oriented, which maybe means more costs, but potentially also means more sorts of things are required that you\u2019re quite good at and therefore, provides an opportunity. And then similarly, if we think about Sacramento, can you tie in any parallels between its margin opportunity and return relative to what we saw out of \u2013 implicitly, any way out of TimBar and Columbus? Thank you guys and good luck in the quarter.","Mark Kowlzan","Let me make a quick comment, and then Tom could add to that. We, obviously, have a very large sales force that caters to the requirements of the customer base and provides a of that focus and value to the customer base. We will continue to extract value as time goes on and grow that opportunity. And then, Tom, what\u2019s the Sacramento Container, again of Corrugated Products Yes. I\u2019ll just add a little bit to that, Mark, as well.","Every time, any customer that has a high level of demand for service, quality, cost takeout, whatever might happen to be, that really fits into our wheelhouse, of course, that\u2019s a \u2013 we consider that to be somewhat of an advantage for us, given the way we go to market. So it all goes down to value, and we can provide a lot of value that\u2019s a great opportunity for us. Regarding Sacramento, yes, we\u2019ve got \u2013 we have many opportunities in Sacramento.","We are off to a terrific start. Culturally, the companies are very well aligned and that, I think, that our returns at Sacramento and there are a lot of different \u2013 there are a lot of moving parts there. So especially when you talk about the sheet feeders that are in the plant that we acquired as well. So there is a lot to be done that there is a lot of opportunities.","George Staphos","Thank you very much.","Mark Kowlzan","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens.","Mark Connelly","Thank you, good morning. So in white paper, you\u2019ve already made some progress on costs, Mark, you\u2019re going up and down. But as you think about the Wallula project and the change to the mix and the shifting production from one place to another. Is there a big opportunity to reoptimize at I Falls and Jackson. I just don\u2019t have a good sense of how much that coated one-side is going to affect those other mills?","Mark Kowlzan","It really has no effect. That was truly a separate business. We did make a very small amount of uncoated freesheet on the Wallula No. 3 machine just to fill up some of the time over the last number of years, since we made the acquisition. But a very small amount of \u2013 primarily some printing and converting grade that came off that machine.","And so the move away from that business is very \u2013 has very little to none impact on I Falls and Jackson. Again, it just helps us again, focus now with that two mills and the group sales force marketing and operations can just concentrate on that better business that we think will remain. ","Mark Connelly","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And just one clarification. How much of the new Wallula linerboard is replacing outside tons? And how much is replacing stuff that you\u2019re shipping or trading for?","Mark Kowlzan","I think the best way to look at that is, when we come on with Wallula, we have a home for it immediately within our system. And so it\u2019s spoken for already.","Mark Connelly","Okay, that\u2019s enough thank you.","Mark Kowlzan","Alright. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.","Anthony Pettinari","Hi, good morning.","Mark Kowlzan","Good morning.","Anthony Pettinari","I was wondering, if it\u2019s possible to say how much of the Wallula CapEx spend is in 2017 versus 2018? And then just from a big picture perspective, you\u2019ve done this conversions before. How do you judge the kind of degree of difficulty or complexity in terms of what you\u2019re doing at Wallula versus the earlier conversion at DeRidder?","Mark Kowlzan","Yes, as far as capital, we\u2019ve got somewhere in that neighborhood of $13 million committed to this year in our capital plan. And a lot of that, obviously, have to go to ordering a lot of the long-lease item equipment and getting started with things, so we\u2019re well on our way. As far as the complexity, the Wallula machine is very, very similar. It\u2019s almost a twin machine of the DeRidder, only it\u2019s a much newer version of the DeRidder No. 3 machine.","So technically speaking, it\u2019s a much more capable machine. And also keep in mind that, we now have owned that business for four years. So right from the beginning, as we were working on the mills, the efficiencies and capital spending opportunities that we identified over the last number of years, we\u2019ve always looked at that mill as an opportunity that could be converted. And so very little of the capital that was spent would be throwaway capital and the capital that was spent was always looked upon as how we could enhance the future of the mill.","And so it already addressed a lot of the unit operations issues and opportunities. And so the complexity of the conversion right now is just ensuring that we\u2019ve done a good job with our engineering and then the installation of the equipment and done in a precision manner. So we have extremely high level of confidence in how we will execute. And so it\u2019s just a matter of waiting for the equipment deliveries and take the machine down in the spring and install and start back up.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then kraft linerboard export prices have been very strong throughout the quarter and the year. Is it possible to say how much of your production you exported in the quarter? And would you expect that share to be kind of stable? Could it rise? Or could it shrink just given the very strong domestic demand you\u2019ve seen?","Mark Kowlzan","Yes, I\u2019m going to let Tom walk you through that because what they \u2013 obviously, we have seen a quarter-to-quarter change in the \u2013 how much we exported and what was available from the mill system that ran exceptionally well. Tom?","Tom Hassfurther","Yes, Anthony, as I mentioned, I mean, we did export significantly more in the third quarter over the second quarter and over the previous year. A lot of that has to do with some catch up that we had in terms of demand from the export market. It\u2019s been, as you said, it\u2019s been very strong. The pricing has been booming up rapidly.","So we did have some catch up we needed to do. And given the fact that the Counce outage was moved into the fourth quarter and the mills produced so well, it really allowed us to \u2013 and then, of course, the one less selling day on boxes, it certainly allowed us the opportunity to really move some of those types in the export market and satisfy those customers that we\u2019ve after a long time and that we continue to service. Again, as I said many times, we\u2019re not huge players in the export market by any means, but we\u2019ve got some key customers that we\u2019ve had for a long, long period of time. And we feel an obligation to continue to take care of those customers.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over.","Mark Kowlzan","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank.","Debbie Jones","Hi, good morning.","Mark Kowlzan","Good morning, Debbie.","Debbie Jones","I think you made some comments in the prepared remarks about maintenance early next year at three locations. Could you just walk through when you think that might be recurring? Is any of this related to Wallula? I mean is this a pull-forward or should we expect higher maintenance next year?","Mark Kowlzan","We\u2019re not going to get into the details of our shutdown plans for next year. We\u2019ll give you all the details on the January call when we go for full year and first quarter guidance. And so, just to understand that we have a heavy first quarter outage plan regarding three of our big operations. And then obviously, the big work and the most complex work will be going on at DeRidder during that period of time with the final phases of the work on the No. 1 machine and the No. 3 machine. So we\u2019ll give you the details on that. But again, it\u2019s not that we don\u2019t have heavy quarters, it\u2019s just we\u2019re calling out the fact that we\u2019ve got increasing demand for every ton we produce. So it just year-after-year becomes that much more critical that we are well prepared on how we look at our inventories going into the new year. So part of that cost is inventory and then obviously the direct maintenance impact. But we\u2019ll call it out, when we have our next call.","Debbie Jones","Okay, thanks. I appreciate that is helpful when looking at Q1 at this point, so I \u2013 second question, just I want to move back to Sacramento Container. There\u2019s just been a lot of activity in the region in Northern California. I think Golden Western packaging also talked about building a box plant, I believe, in Saxton, and I just wanted to get a better sense of what is your end-market exposure there? What is attractive about that region? And I think Amazon is expanding. You have [indiscernible] if I talk about exports as well. Could you just talk us through what your exposure is and what you are looking forward to? ","Mark Kowlzan","Yes. Tom, why don\u2019t you take that question?","Tom Hassfurther","Yes. Debbie, listen, if you think about the number of customers we have at all of the businesses that we sell into, we don\u2019t get \u2013 we don\u2019t break things out specifically and say we want to go into a certain segment or certain anything. But, the fact, Northern California specifically, of course, is, I mean, is enormous ag region and then you\u2019ve also got Sacramento itself located just outside of the Bay Area as well. So you have a large industrial base as well.","So there is a broad segment of customers to be supplied in that area of the country and it\u2019s growing. And of course, you can talk about the Amazon, back then you talked about Silicon Valley and a lot of other things to go on there. But it just is a \u2013 it is one of the faster growing regions of the state and of the country, quite frankly. So it provides us a lot of great opportunities.","Debbie Jones","Okay thanks I will turn over.","Tom Hassfurther","Thank you next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc.","Adam Josephson","Thanks good morning everyone.","Tom Hassfurther","Good morning","Adam Josephson","Tom, just one clarification on the 5% October. Is that inclusive of Columbus from last year? Or is that an organic number?","Tom Hassfurther","Well, it\u2019s not really inclusive of Columbus either, because we didn\u2019t have it last year at this time. But I\u2019m factoring in, I do know now, because I\u2019ve got numbers because they\u2019re growing at about that rate. So I roll that into our 5% number because they are not going to impact that dramatically anyway, it being just one plant.","Adam Josephson","Okay. In terms of your guidance for 4Q, what does that incorporate in terms of any uncoated freesheet price increase that you announced for October? And then what\u2019s the Sacramento contribution to the 4Q guidance?","Mark Kowlzan","Yes. On the paper pricing increase, we have a very small amount of benefit. Obviously, the price increase was announced. We\u2019re working through that, but with the big piece of the volume that we moved into customer base until we see paper trader picks up that index, you don\u2019t start billing some of the customers. So it\u2019s going to be a very minimal positive for fourth quarter.","Adam Josephson","Yes","Bob Mundy","Yes. There certainly is some benefit there and $2.00, $3.00 something like that probably expect. Adam Jesse.","Adam Josephson","Okay. And then, Mark, just one last one. Just in terms of export prices moving up. Obviously, the synergies from your recent acquisitions of converters have presumably been partly related to pulling tons out of lower-priced export markets. Appreciating that you\u2019re also integrating the additional DeRidder tons and that you have a small export presence to begin with. But with the spread between domestic and export prices shrinking, and I don\u2019t know how sustainable that is, but it\u2019s clearly been shrinking pretty dramatically. Does that reduce the expected synergies from those acquisitions?","Mark Kowlzan","No. The way we look at the entire footprint nationwide, we move our tons through our system in the most opportunistic manner we can. And as has Tom mentioned and I mentioned many times, we have some very good legacy customers worldwide. And so we will continue to take advantage of that. And then, regarding our footprint nationwide, how we move and what tons we move into those systems, you have to consider that the differential between the transportation cost to move only tons out of our own mills across the nation as opposed to being able to take advantage of either doing trades or purchasing local tons and then selling some of these tons that we make offshore, it\u2019s part of a complex analysis. But we are very opportunistic on how we move our tons through the system.","Adam Josephson","Thanks a lot Mark.","Mark Kowlzan","Okay, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.","Mark Weintraub","One follow-up just on the mills down in the first quarter. And as much as last year or this year, I should say, 2017 first quarter, there was only $0.07 maintenance in outage. Fourth quarter, I think, you\u2019re guiding to about $0.23. And it sounds like 1Q \u201818 that I realize you\u2019re not giving specifics at this point. But that we should be assuming, it\u2019s going to \u2013 will it be much closer to the $0.23 than the $0.07 from 20 \u2013 first quarter of \u201817?","Mark Kowlzan","I think, as Mark said earlier, Mark, we haven\u2019t given out any EPS numbers relative to the outages. We\u2019ll do that on the next call. But it will be one heavy \u2013 one of the heaviest maybe in a long time as far as tons impacted in the first quarter next year. So it will be sizable. But it is the beginning of the year, so you certainly don\u2019t have some of those advertising expenses hitting you early of the year, as you do in the fourth quarter of this year.","Mark Weintraub","Can you remind us this year, how many mills you had down in the first quarter?","Mark Kowlzan","Yes, We had, I believe, it was 2. But again, the scope of the work being done, so you could have 1 mill down, but it\u2019s a lot of work being done, it could have a bigger impact and have not too many notes. But there were 2 down last year\u2019s first quarter.","Mark Weintraub","Okay, great. The second, I just want to clarify, I think you had said that price mix in the corrugated business provided $0.20 improvement 3Q versus 2Q. Did I hear that right?","Mark Kowlzan","Yes","Mark Weintraub","And I guess, I\u2019m just trying to kind of understand, I believe, year-over-year, you note that it was $0.61 better.","Mark Kowlzan","That includes containerboard and export and box.","Mark Weintraub","Okay. And what did the $0.20 include.","Mark Kowlzan","That\u2019s primarily on the corrugated side.","Mark Weintraub","Okay. So not export or containerboard?","Mark Kowlzan","No, no. Export was a positive, but it wasn\u2019t a part of that $0.20 that Tom mentioned.","Mark Weintraub","Okay, okay. Then one last one. So the 5% per day improvement so far this month, I just want to make sure that I\u2019m understanding this right, because this month, there is going to be one more shipping day for all of October than last year. And so that, if for the full month, you had a 5% per day improvement then on an absolute basis, you\u2019d be up 10%. Is that how we should interpret it? Because I realize it could \u2013 maybe that is not necessarily how to interpret it. So I just wanted to clarify.","Mark Kowlzan","Mark, I mean, that\u2019s what the math says. But as you typically know, to smooth things out, I mean often what we do is we take the app speed of the total amount out in the per day and try to kind of find an average in those. So that gives you a little bit better flavor, I think, for smoothing it out over the year as opposed to having these just monthly spike with the 1 extra day. You understand, what I\u2019m saying?","Mark Weintraub","I do thank you","Mark Kowlzan","Next question please","Operator","Your next question comes from James Armstrong with Armstrong Investments.","James Armstrong","Good morning congrats and a good quarter.","Mark Kowlzan","Good morning James thank you.","James Armstrong","The first question is, your mix was a nice help in the Packaging segment even beyond pricing. Could you give us a little more color on how your mix changed and what\u2019s going to change as we go into the fourth quarter?","Mark Kowlzan","I\u2019ll start off with that, and then Tom can finish it up.But again, the third quarter is always a very, very good rich mix for us in terms of what we\u2019re producing and what\u2019s going to the market, displays and a lot of holiday business activity. And then that falls off obviously in the fourth quarter. Tom, do you want to add color on that?","Tom Hassfurther","It\u2019s primarily, when we talk about the richer mix, it\u2019s primarily the graphics-related side of the business. And then perhaps on the ag side, there might be some krafts that tend to \u2013 tend to give us a little better return than others.","James Armstrong","That helps a lot. Switching gears, are you seeing any seasonal change from e-commerce. Specifically, are you seeing any evidence that demand is extending through November and December that it hadn\u2019t in previous years?","Mark Kowlzan","I think, again, year-after-year, we continue to see that smoothing benefit of going into the latter part of the year and then into the new year, we have seen less downturn in volume activity. So obviously, the e-commerce channel is becoming very important to the industry year-around.","Tom Hassfurther","Yes. And there is a large percentage of e- comm that ships in the fourth quarter. I mean, it ramps up quite rapidly over a 60 and 90-day period.","James Armstrong","Okay that helps thank you.","Mark Kowlzan","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo Securities. ","Chris Manuel","Just a couple of questions from me. First, you kind of opened the door earlier, when you talked about how you think about mills in long- term purposes for them within your system. So I\u2019m going to kind of try to exploit that. But when you think about capital allocation, you spent this year\u2019s capital \u2013 or this year\u2019s free cash flow effectively buying Sacramento and doing the conversion at Wallula.","As you kind of think going forward and your needs to continue to expand capacity, how do you think about perhaps some of the other paper mills, whether it\u2019s maybe not as much International Falls, but perhaps \u2013 but maybe done in Jackson, where you\u2019re in kind of the softwood basket. Opportunities as you go forward, say the next 3 to 5 years, how would you handicap the likelihood that you have another containerboard mill out of one of those? ","Mark Kowlzan","I don\u2019t want to speculate that and that\u2019s what it is, it\u2019s pure speculation. We, again, have various means of supplying our system and necessary tons. And as long as the paper business, and this is more a consideration, as long as the paper business continues to generate the kind of cash it\u2019s generating and the positions it is, it remains a good piece of the portfolio.","And then you have to assume also your cost to convert each asset is very unique and different versus going out looking at purchasing a mill on the market and doing either a conversion or buying an outright containerboard mill. So there\u2019s various complex considerations. But, again, I don\u2019t want to speculate on the future. Obviously, that\u2019s wide open.","Chris Manuel","All right. That\u2019s fair. If I could come back to Sacramento for a second. I think, as I try to read through your press release at that time, you talked about the ability to do up to 200,000 tons to integrate. Kind of 2 parts to this question. One, roughly what\u2019s the tons or the use that Sacramento has today, just because you could integrate that doesn\u2019t mean it couldn\u2019t be more bigger or smaller, I guess through ton, but \u2013 so part A is roughly what size? Is that what it is 200,000 or is it something more than that? And two, were you supplying any to them today? Or is that an organic number? ","Mark Kowlzan","Yes, the 200,000 is a good number to use right now. And no, we weren\u2019t supplying. Tom, you want to give him a little more detail on that [indiscernible] business? Yes, it\u2019s 200,000 tons. That\u2019s a good number you used, Chris. And as Mark just indicated, I mean that\u2019s all \u2013 that will all be opportunity for us because we were not supplying any of those customers.","Chris Manuel","Okay. And just 1 last quick question for Bob. I know you\u2019re not trying to predict timing, but do you have any more insurance that you\u2019re anticipating getting over the next 2, 3, 4 quarters? Is it similar size? Or are you done there? ","Bob Mundy","No. We do, Chris. If you take what I\u2019ve indicated was a range of what we were expecting and compared to what we\u2019ve been able to record over the last couple of quarters. There\u2019s still \u2013 there\u2019s still $0.04, maybe a little bit more than I would expect to see. ","Chris Manuel","Okay, thank you guys good luck.","Bob Mundy","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays.","Scott Gaffner","Just a follow-up on the mix in particular in the Packaging segment. So as you move into 4Q, this year, versus 3Q, is there anything that would suggest that the mix issues are more pronounced than they have been, say, last year? Or should we think that\u2019s pretty similar? ","Mark Kowlzan","It\u2019s very, very similar. We see this every fourth quarter. It\u2019s just the nature of the marketplace. ","Scott Gaffner","Okay. And just some of the freight issues you experienced in the quarter. Obviously, others did as well. Have you seen those start to abate both on [indiscernible] in availability and a cost perspective? ","Mark Kowlzan","Some regions have, but overall nationwide. We\u2019re still faced with the \u2013 on the trucking side, it\u2019s the driver availability issue. And then on rail, you have the 5 Class I rails that we\u2019re dealing with in particular, that changes that everyone\u2019s is dealing with on the East Coast and Southeast through the mid-part of the country with1 Class I railroad, in particular, that we\u2019re all having to manage around. So in general, transportation continues to be a headwind. And then what happened during the hurricane period and what that did to trucking demand. So again, for the foreseeable future, transportation continues to be one of the items that is very high on my radar screen, day-to-day.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. And then just, I know, I realize, you don\u2019t want to get into the cadence of the maintenance outages as we move into2018. But as more and more companies are moving to sort of 18-month outage schedules. I mean, how should we think about just the absolute year-over-year outages 2018 versus 2017, higher, lower, similar? ","Mark Kowlzan","I don\u2019t want to get into the details on that. We\u2019ve already, for the last few years, been into 18- month cycles on a number of our mills. And again, it depends on the asset base and the flexibility within a mill. But we started that a few years ago on taking advantage of our maintenance programs and technology available to run the mills out, extended periods of time. So \u2013 but again, for all the reasons we have already mentioned, I don\u2019t want to get into the details of next year plans.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. Last one from me, just a follow- up on Adam\u2019s question on box integration or assets, buying, converting assets. When you look at the multiples, I mean a large part of the multiples has been \u2013 the post synergy multiples has been driven by taking export tons in your system and integrating those into domestic converting. So therefore, by definition almost that post synergy multiples would go higher, if export prices go higher. Does that at all impact your decision-making around whether to go after some of these assets? ","Mark Kowlzan","We will continue to evaluate. It\u2019s basically the book of business. If we have an opportunity to acquire a great book of business that fits our portfolio, you will have to assume we\u2019d be very interested in that. Tom","Thomas Hassfurther","Yes, I would just add each one of these acquisitions stand on their own 2 feet. They\u2019ve got to make perfect sense for us. And they\u2019re also \u2013 and have to be able to be standalones outside of what the integration level is or those integration opportunities. So we analyze each one individually. And like I said, they\u2019re going to have to pay for themselves. ","Mark Kowlzan","Okay thanks.","Thomas Hassfurther","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson.","Steve Chercover","It\u2019s late in the session. So I\u2019m going to ask a weird one. Everyone talks about when China is going to resume purchasing OCC. But if we were to assume that they never buy another ton again, would they need to buy virgin linerboard from us like they did before 2000? ","Mark Kowlzan","That\u2019s again, you can speculate all you want on how they would fiber up their system. So that\u2019s not even worth wasting the time.","Steve Chercover","Okay. Well, I wasn\u2019t trying to waste your time. But if you assume that they did, could you export from Wallula, it\u2019s on the Columbia River? ","Mark Kowlzan","Again, that\u2019s pure speculation, not an opportunity \u2013 that\u2019s not even on our radar screen.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Maguire","Most of my questions have already been asked and answered. But I do want to just follow up, Mark, on your response to Anthony\u2019s question about some of the capital spending that you already did at Wallula to kind of position it for this conversion. Would it be fair to say that sort of the all-in capital costs for the conversion are little bit higher than the \u2013 that are recorded in the press release?","And what I\u2019m really trying to get at is, you quoted last quarter a number that was a lot higher for somebody to do a conversion. Just trying to get a sense as to whether that\u2019s a come down in your minds? Or maybe this is just an opportunity where you\u2019ve already laid a lot of that capital out in earlier years to your maintenance program and other projects.","And just you kind of update on whatever cost you think would be involved in a different company trying to do a conversion like this?","Mark Kowlzan","Every mill is unique, every asset is unique. And we have the advantage of, 4 years ago, taking all of these assets and understanding what their opportunities were and also where there strength and weaknesses were. And so as we put in a massive amount of effort into optimizing the mills, each dollar of capital that was spent over this period of time as a standalone on its own metrics of return.","And so we are mindful of how we spent that money and understanding that, that dollars spent on capital improvement and efficiency improvements could follow through to a containerboard platform in that asset i.e., Wallula as an example. So the capital that we called up $150 million for conversion is the capital that we will require and take that machine from its current position today to the 400,000 ton per year of virgin kraft.","And then again, any other capital that has been spent or will be spent is standalone, high return opportunities and\/or maintenance capital. And again, every mill is unique in its needs and its opportunities.","Brian Maguire","Okay, thanks for that good luck in the quarter.","Mark Kowlzan","Alright, thank you. Any other questions?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with Roe Equity Research.","Gail Glazerman","Hi, good morning. Mark, going back to your comments on transport. Are the concerns anywhere near where they would have been a year-or-so ago, when things were very, very tight and the industry was carrying a lot more inventory? Or is it more manageable compared to that?","Mark Kowlzan","Well, it\u2019s manageable. I\u2019m not going to say more manageable, it\u2019s just manageable. But we have the matter in regard to the one class railroad, as I mentioned in the eastern part of the country to southeast, that\u2019s everybody is working with right now. And then you have the trucking industry. They are going through their own issues of very strong demand and driver shortages, also faced with the latter. As the year wraps up, the trucking industry will have no regulations in place regarding electronic logbooks per se that are required, is mandatory throughout the industry. So there\u2019s a lot of moving parts. But it\u2019s just one of the items that is manageable, but it requires much more attention than it did in past years.","Gail Glazerman","Okay. And on export pricing and markets, any concern that if OCC stay down for a prolonged period of time that might impact export pricing? Or do you think it\u2019s been driven by just underlying demand for actual kraftliner globally?","Mark Kowlzan","I don\u2019t want to speculate on that. That\u2019s something that\u2019s not even worth talking about.","Gail Glazerman","Okay. And I\u2019m going to appreciate \u2013 can you just walk through what you\u2019re seeing in the market that supported the price increase announcement?","Mark Kowlzan","Again, regarding pricing matters, that\u2019s something we don\u2019t talk about. Pricing is something we discuss between ourselves and our customers. And so I\u2019m going to leave it at that.","Gail Glazerman","Okay. Thank you","Mark Kowlzan","Alright, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Herb Blutenthal with Hartline Investment Corp.","Herb Blutenthal","Good morning. I want to ask one subject that hasn\u2019t been brought up and that is, debt. I have two questions basically. The first is debt reduction. You at the times talked about you wanted to \u2013 after acquisitions and spending internally on the conversion of machines, et cetera, talked about the relatively high debt percentage up in the 50% range. And what is your thoughts on that? That\u2019s my first question, sir.","Mark Kowlzan","I\u2019m not sure, I understand when you say 50% range. If you look our debt-to-EBITDA ratios, we\u2019re down below 2 right now. We\u2019re probably down around 1.9. So in a very comfortable range on our debt position on our balance sheet.","Herb Blutenthal","I was trying to relate it to long-term debt to total long-term stockholder net worth. I was \u2013 that\u2019s what I was looking at. The 2 combined, debt is about 50% according to Value Line.","Mark Kowlzan","Well, it is what it is. It\u2019s something we, quite frankly, we don\u2019t pay that much attention to it routinely.","Herb Blutenthal","You don\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem in other words. So your debt \u2013 there is no major debt paydown that you see a [indiscernible] for, is that correct?","Mark Kowlzan","Correct.","Herb Blutenthal","Okay. And then the second question, which \u2013 with all the information about the email and Amazon, et cetera. Do you give any indication of proportionally approximately the size of Amazon that other online merchants, how much is that to the revenue and profit? I know you can\u2019t give anything specific, but is it \u2013 can you give us any general comments about it?","Mark Kowlzan","That\u2019s one particular item we\u2019ve mentioned in the past. We don\u2019t call that out. We don\u2019t measure that per se to the degree that you\u2019re asking for. As Tom mentioned earlier, it is a very broad portion of the opportunity that we deal with every day. And so just \u2013 everyone has to understand and appreciate that it\u2019s ongoing. It\u2019s an important opportunity for the industry to continue working through that channel with our customer base. But again, we don\u2019t measure it and try to quantify the exact impact. We know it\u2019s [indiscernible].","Herb Blutenthal","I would say that \u2013 the bottom line, you guys are doing a great job at the long-term historical look. I have that \u2013 followed your company previously, but I am quite impressed. That\u2019s it.","Mark Kowlzan","Okay. All right. With that, operator, we are out of time. Thank you for joining us on the call today. We look forward to seeing you, talking with you in January, when we wrap up our full year and giving the first quarter outlook. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Your host today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chief Executive Officer of PCA. Upon conclusion of his narrative, there will be a Q&A session.","I will now turn the conference call over to Mr. Kowlzan, and please proceed when you are ready.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning and thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's first quarter 2018 earnings release conference call. I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of Packaging Corporation of America. And with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs our Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer.","I'll begin the call with an overview of our first quarter results and then I'll turn the call over to Tom and Bob who will provide more details. I'll then wrap things up and then we'll be glad to take any questions. Yesterday, we reported first quarter net income of $140 million or $1.48 per share.","First quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.07 per share primarily related to the discontinuing paper operations associated with the previously announced conversion of the number three paper machine at our Wallula, Washington mill to linerboard. Excluding special items, first quarter 2018 net income was $147 million or $1.55 per share compared to the first quarter of 2017 net income of $120 million or $1.27 per share. First quarter net sales were $1.7 billion in 2018 and $1.5 billion in 2017. Total company EBITDA for the first quarter excluding special items was $322 million in 2018 and $299 million in 2017.","Excluding the special items, first quarter 2018 earnings per share of $1.55 was $0.28 per share above the first quarter of 2017, driven primarily by higher prices in mix of $0.39 and volumes $0.19 in our Packaging segment. Higher volumes in our Paper segment were $0.02 and a favorable tax rate $0.19 resulting from the recent tax reform changes. These items were partially offset by higher operating and converting cost totaling $0.24 per share, primarily due to the inflation related increases with labor and benefits costs, repair and material costs, environmental and other professional services costs, equipment and building rental costs as well as the addition of operating cost related to our Sacramento Container acquisition.","We also incurred weather related costs at some of our mills and box plants early in the quarter and again in March that did impact some of our box plants in the North East. In addition, we have lower prices in mix in our Paper segment for $0.05; higher annual outage expenses, $0.11; higher freight expense, $0.07; higher depreciation, $0.03; and higher interest expense, $0.01. Our results were $0.03 per share above first quarter guidance primarily due to higher volumes and prices in mix in our Packaging and Paper segments, partially offset by higher than expected freight expenses and operating cost.","Looking at our Packaging business, EBITDA excluding special items in the first quarter 2018 of $308 million with sales of $1.4 billion resulted in a margin of 22% versus last year's EBITDA of $274 million and sales of $1.3 billion or a 21.7% margin. Our containerboard mills ran extremely well. We successfully executed scheduled maintenance outages at three of the mills and the production optimization were completed at our DeRidder Mill during their scheduled outage exceeded our expectations with very strong performance immediately after the start-up.","This outstanding effort, along with the inventory we were able to build prior to the outages, allowed us to achieve record first quarter containerboard shipments and supply a record first quarter box shipments. We entered the quarter with containerboard inventories over 23,000 tons below year-end 2017 levels and 31,000 tons above the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to the addition of the inventory needs of our Sacramento Container acquisition.","I'll now turn it over to Tom who will provide more details on containerboard sales and our corrugated business.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Thanks, Mark. Overall, corrugated products and containerboard demand remained very strong during the quarter. As Mark indicated, in corrugated products, we had record first quarter box shipments which were higher in total by 6% with one less workday or 7.7% per workday compared to the first quarter of 2017.","Continued strong demand in both our domestic and export markets improved our outside sales volume of containerboard by about 23,000 tons versus last year's first quarter. Outside volume was 9,000 tons below the fourth quarter of 2017 in order to help supply our internal plants during the scheduled outages at our mills. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.29 per share above the first quarter of 2017 and up $0.05 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Export containerboard prices were up $0.10 per share compared to the first quarter of 2017 and up $0.01 per share compared to fourth quarter of 2017.","I'll now turn it back to Mark.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Thanks, Tom. Looking at our Paper segment, EBITDA excluding special items in the first quarter was $31 million, with sales of $269 million or 12% margin compared to the first quarter of 2017 EBITDA of $42 million and sales of $259 million or 16% margin. Although we have strong cut-size and printing and converting volumes for the quarter, up 33,000 tons compared to the first quarter of 2017, the decline in EBITDA versus last year was primarily due to the lower volume and higher cost in our pressure-sensitive business as we continue to phase out those products out of our Wallula mill. Also, we experienced lower prices and mix across all grades, inflation on input costs and operating costs, as well as higher freight expenses.","However, compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, and excluding the pressure-sensitive business, we continue to see realization of our recent price increases, with average cut-size and printing and converting prices up 1% and volumes continue to be strong, up almost 5%. As mentioned previously, we are phasing out of the paper business supplied by the number three machine at our Wallula mill, and we are on schedule with the conversion of this paper machine to a 400,000 ton per year, high performance, 100% virgin kraft linerboard machine beginning next month in May.","I'll now turn it over to Bob.","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","Thanks, Mark. We ended the quarter with $102 million of cash on hand. The primary uses of cash during the quarter included $150 million for the March retirement of the note that we mentioned on our last call with capital expenditures of $108 million common stock dividends totaling $59 million, $10 million for state tax payments and interest payments of $9 million.","I want to update you on the full-year tax guidance we provided on last quarter's call. As mentioned, the tax rate ranges provided were based on currently available information, and that over time, assumptions and estimates could change as federal tax reform was better defined in the states and (8:33) related changes.","The estimate range for our 2018 combined federal and state tax rate has changed to 14% to 16% versus the 12% to 14% range provided previously. This is due to certain states decoupling from the federal change, allowing 100% expensing of most capital spending as these states believe they are not prepared for the negative impact this would have on their tax revenues.","Excluding the overpayment of taxes in 2017, which we made in December just prior to the tax reform changes being enacted, our combined federal and state tax rate would be in the range of 19% to 21% versus the 17% to 19% we provided earlier. The state changes had a minimal impact on our booked effective tax rate for 2018, so our estimate for this remains in the range of 24% to 26%. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was 24.9%.","I'll now turn it back over to Mark.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Thank you, Bob. Looking ahead, as we move from the first quarter and into the second quarter, we expect continued strong demand in our Packaging segment to result in higher corrugated products and containerboard shipments, and we will continue to implement our previously announced Packaging segment price increases. In our Paper segment, we expect volumes to be lower as we begin the conversion of the number three machine in our Wallula mill from paper to linerboard. And we'll continue implementing the previously announced paper price increases.","We also anticipate continued price inflation in chemical and freight costs, incremental wage pressure with a tighter labor market or slightly lower recycle fiber costs and improving energy costs that will move into the seasonally milder weather. Scheduled maintenance outage costs should move lower and we expect a slightly lower tax rate as well. Considering these items, we expect second quarter earnings of $1.96 per share.","With that, we'll be happy to entertain any questions. But I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. The statements were based on current estimates, expectations or projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.","With that, operator, I'd like to open the call to questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for all the details.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning, Chip.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","First question I had is I think a big issue is thinking about how the whole Wallula transformation is going to impact next year versus this year. Obviously, this year, you're going to lose the benefit of the pressure-sensitive volumes and there's going to be startup costs that I assume will flow through the income statement and then next year, obviously, you would hopefully have most of that 400,000 tons available. And I didn't know if it was reasonable to think the swing factor could equal something like a $100 or $200 a ton as \u2013 of those new tons as you swing from this year to next year.","I guess said differently, could it be a $60 million or $80 million swing again going from this year startup costs and the lack of pressure-sensitive business to next year's having those extra volumes of containerboard?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Chip, I don't want to get into the details on our cost per ton and margins but if you look at our history and you look at our current estimated cost and margins, you would have to assume if we do what we're supposed to do and bring the machine up to full capacity by the latter part of the fourth quarter, then we will have the full benefit coming on for next year.","So, this year, as we called out in the first quarter it was going to be the choppy year as we exited the release liner business and incurred those costs and then incurred the conversion and startup cost and the ramp-up cost. And because this is a two-phase project in one year where we're seeing the work beginning in May and then hopefully the plant calls for the startup of the machine in the early part of June, you'd see a certain level of production of linerboard through the summer months at a steady pace. But again at a higher cost because of just lower tonnage and then we take the machine down again for the few weeks in October. So, it's a choppy year but I think if you model and you know what our traditional cost and margins are, you can get to that number that you're talking about.","Bob, do you want to add some color to that one?","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. I would just say, Chip, that once things are up and running at the level that you mentioned as far as the capacity of that new machine, that you're in the ballpark as far as what you're seeing as far as (13:54).","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And just a quick follow-up. As you \u2013 we've seen now, I guess, three years or four years of what we used to see in terms of demand growth before outsourcing in the last decade. Obviously, there are different mixes now, less industrial demand, more e-commerce. What are your customers saying in terms of what you think they will need going forward? And how do you all think about e-commerce? And can you share with us some idea of how important that is, if not to your overall business maybe to the growth of your business?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. I'm going to let Tom give you color on that. We've spoken about that in the past few calls. So, Tom, why don't you go ahead and elaborate on that one?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Chip, one thing I would have to say based on your commentary is I don't see less industrial demand. In fact, I think we've called out a number of times, when we look across our customer base, that not only did not accrue anymore but that it started to turn up, and we've continued to see that the industrial sector has been a good sector for us as well. But when you look at e-commerce, I mean, obviously, e-commerce has become an important segment for the packaging sales. And we'll continue to grow, and it's certainly the biggest growth engine going on right now.","And it occurs in a lot of different ways, and of course, we've got a lot of customers that have entered the e-commerce segment outside of your traditional big e-commerce customers. But it's a growth segment, it's going to be important to the industry. It's a whole new way of delivering to customers, and it will continue to grow. And I think it's, as I said, an important sector that we're certainly focused on as well.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","All right. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Connelly with Stephens. Your line is open.","Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.","Thank you. Mark, with WestRock doing KapStone and IP trying to do Smurfit Kappa, some investors seem to think that you have to do something. So what I'm wondering is do these two deals make you think differently or leave you more worried about the strength of your overall competitive position and what you're doing now.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","To answer the first part of your question; we don't have to do anything differently. We have the open flexibility built into the plan, great balance sheet. We've got well capitalized assets. We've got an organization that can execute on anything with the balance sheet and the financials where they are. It allows us to move on any opportunity that we would determine make sense for us.","We have a number of opportunities as you would expect as we call out internal organic type of opportunities to continue enhancing our activities. We will continue to take advantage if opportunities to buy box plants as we've done over the last number of years. If those opportunities present themselves, we will continue to take advantage of that. So, long story, no, we don't plan on changing anything right now but we certainly have tremendous amount of opportunity to move in many different directions.","Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.","You probably just disappointed a bunch of bankers. Can we talk about projects? I mean, Wallula is obviously big but with DeRidder done, does that free up your people to take on other significant debottlenecking projects and you have those sorts of things already lined up or any big rebuilt like a boiler or something coming up?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","As we've stated over the years, we always have a portfolio of opportunities that we've already done pre-engineering on and that's on the mill and the box plants. And so with the number of people that we've been able to hire, just to reiterate, just in the last three years, we brought on over 155 new engineers into the company, and they're all gainfully employed on all these projects. And so we had the ultimate opportunity now to utilize our internal strength on these types of projects.","And I guess to answer your question, yes, we certainly are looking on a going forward basis at opportunities in the box plants and the mills on high return capability in terms of returning value to shareholders on how we deploy our free cash. And so I think without getting into details because I don't want to \u2013 again, I don't want to give away all the goodness you've \u2013 I think if you look at our history, we always have these opportunities.","And I want to say something too about DeRidder. During a three-month period of DeRidder, we had over 80 people at DeRidder from our technology organization and about 30 people from a number of our mills assisting in the run-up to the conversion in the final phase of DeRidder. No sooner was that done, a number of those forces moved out to Wallula and then out to the remaining shutdown activity that we had going on. So, we have tremendous capability built into this organization now to do projects, to do acquisition activity. So, we've got a lot, but again, I don't want to give details on what we're going to be working on. But you have to trust us when we say we've got some good opportunities for high return. It's all on the capital.","Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.","It's just what I was looking for. Thank you, Mark.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Good. Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, gentlemen, and congratulations for the strong start to the year.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Thank you.","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","Thank you.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Two questions I wanted to kind of get at. One is \u2013 we'll take the easy one first. Freight is a component. A lot of freight contracts are coming due \u2013 most of my understanding kind of come due in that April-May timeframe. Do you have a sense as to what you're seeing freight being up on a year-over-year basis? Is it in that 10% to 15% range?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","That's a good number, to your point, and it's varying by region, by lane. We have a number of mechanisms that we transport finished goods. We have a number of carriers that we have arrangements with in terms of contractual arrangements. We have a lot of spot market opportunities that we work with carriers. On any given day, we're probably moving 2,000 truckloads of finished products around the lower 48 states. And so the key to that was establishing good relationships with carriers over the last number of years. But nevertheless, we are facing those inflationary cost pressures. I think that's a good number.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. The second is more of a \u2013 and it's a much more difficult question to answer. But how do you \u2013 when I think of the state of the industry right now, it would seem to me as though profitability, in particular in the recycled grades, not as much in the kraft grades, but at least in the recycled grades where OCC and mix paper and different things are is exceptionally good or potentially too good. And is it a spot where things stay as they are could incite significant amounts of capacity. Can we see some of it light up in the Fox River Valley just in the last few months. How do you think about the balance of the industry in the intermediate term, I think, the next year or two? And the profitability and the opportunity for recycled grades to more capacity come in the market or do you think perhaps either OCC goes up or the spread between kraft and recycled widens? How do you think of that?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Right. First, the comment regarding entry into the business from conversions, some of what's been announced is very small capacity. Some of what's being announced is just that they're discussing that. They're talking about bringing some of that on. In fact, just in the last few years, how many projects had been discussed and talked about that never came to be. And so there's a minimal amount of what is coming on. And at the end of the day, you have to go back to and say you're going to convert something. Where are you going to sell it? Who is your customer and what's the product line you're going to produce into this market and what type of profitability, opportunity can you convert?","And so, part of that is you think about the shrinking number of independents in the last number of years and what's been taking place there. And so, in terms of where to go with tons, freight market tons is a very limited opportunity. And so, Tom, do you want to add some color to that because, again, I think we talked about this for a number of a few years.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah, I would say...","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Story hasn't changed.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. I know. It hasn't changed and if you \u2013 you have to look historically those you see and if you pick a certain point in time like it is right now, yet, yes, OCC is down, but I think anybody that looks at that, if that's their primary furnish for fiber, they're going to have to look at the historic trends and the historic trend is going to be significantly higher than what it is right now over the long haul. So, I think that's a decision that needs to come into being. And I think just generally, as Mark indicated, you've got to be able to move those tons somewhere and the dynamics of the marketplace is certainly the outside marketplace to change dramatically.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","The other fact that I think people are sometime not appreciating this, when you think about input costs across the board on all of your input, fiber is a major component, but you have all of your \u2013 the raw materials and labor and energy, now transportation. So, you have a significant number of costs that have to go into the analysis to tell somebody whether they can make a project make sense financially. And so, you have to believe that with the lack of conversions so far that have truly taken place that the math just doesn't work in many cases.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Well, thank you very much for the color. I appreciate it. Good luck, guys.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","All right. Thank you.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Thank you.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for the details. How are you doing, Mark? Hey, I guess the first question I have \u2013 and you've touched on it a bit, can you talk about why it would appear that DeRidder came up so well. What do you have now in DeRidder in terms of capabilities and if you'd look back relative to when you first bought the asset, what have you been most surprised by in terms of the asset? And a related question and I had a follow-on and I'll finish there. The related question is, what are the tie-ins or parallels to Wallula and what you might be able to do there from a process standpoint?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. Regarding DeRidder, there was never any doubt in our minds that we have tremendous opportunity to create tremendous value at DeRidder. What I'm most pleased about is the execution from the organization and not just making it a great facility but I would have to say, based on what we've seen coming out of the startup on February 26 and the performance of the mill during the month of March, as a two-machine containerboard mill, that mill, I would be willing to bet, is the most productive two-machine linerboard mill containerboard because we do mix a medium on number three, but the most productive machine, just a two-machine system in the world. And you have to assume the costs that go in line with that.","And so, over a four-year period, we've taken that mill and created just a tremendous opportunity. At today's basis on a run rate basis, we've far exceeded what the plan had called for. On an annualized basis, depending on the basis weight mix you apply that mill, that mill now sits at a 1.2 million ton capacity type of opportunity, depending on what we choose to make there. And so, it's a tremendous platform for us to go forward.","That being said, we've taken the lessons learned from DeRidder and we applied it in parallel at Wallula, the same technology that went into the number three machine conversion at DeRidder is being applied at the Wallula number three machine, and that's what's giving us the confidence to do this in a much quicker fashion and then shorten up the conversion time to just two phases all done this year. I want to throw something out, too. I mean from a performance point of view I wasn't totally pleased. The machine only ran at 99% uptime efficiency during the month of March. So, we've got some room to improve.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","(27:58) Wallula, if we execute as well as we should and we've done our job in ensuring the quality of the equipment that we're buying and then on the installation side of it that we do a precision installation, the machine should be as successful as DeRidder. And so, we'll give you the details in July.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","All right. Thanks for that, Mark. My follow-on kind of a two-part and I'll turn it over. Can you comment at all, Tom, about what kind of volumes and bookings you're seeing early in the quarter? And then to, Bob, a question that comes up periodically, I think Mark was touching on it earlier, given current status of trends, right, who knows what can happen to demand and pricing next year, next month, so on. But given what we're seeing right now the company is going to be generating fairly significant cash flow certainly relative to where you were a few years ago and you keep deleveraging. I know you don't want to share too much of your cards here, if any at all, but are we more likely to see you deploy that to projects or value return in the current environment or would you be more apt to use that capital and powder in a downturn when machines might be less expensive, when your stock might be less expensive, when other opportunities might be less expensive. How would you have us think about that? Thanks for listening and good luck in the quarter.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","George, I'll take the first part of that question and that is our bookings through 14 days were up 5%. So we're off to a very good start for the quarter, and we feel very good about the continuing strong volume demand. I'll turn it back over to Bob, Mark.","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. Obviously, George, the \u2013 really, things don't change for us. We look at things, the way we've done things historically is how we'll go forward. And I can read that if things play out as we would suspect that there will be some \u2013 especially with tax reform some nice cash generated this year. But we'll still have a balanced approach towards looking at our dividends and share buyback opportunities.","Mark has talked about high return capital projects that we always have on the shelf and ready to go if they make sense. And as we've said before, box plant acquisitions when they come up and they're the right fit for us, we want to be able to have the dry powder, as you said, available for that. And we'll maintain \u2013 we are somewhat conservative on our balance sheet. And to your point about things depending on who you're listening to, it's how the economy goes up, ways up here, we'll be in good shape. We'll be prepared for that as well, so we sort of like what we've been operating and we'll continue to do it that way.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Probably a better part of two decades now of -- just shy of two decades, we've been recognized as being conservative when it comes to our balance sheet and not taking inordinate amount of risks. It's paid off well for us. We don't plan on changing that, again, but we have tremendous opportunities. We've been criticized in the past of being too conservative. But again, I'd rather take that criticism than the alternatives. And so, we're very mindful of the enterprise and not putting the enterprise in inordinate amount of risk and yet, we still have tremendous opportunity to continue to bring tremendous value to the shareholders. So, I think that's not going to change.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you for the time.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Tom, just one on OCC. I know you talked a little bit about it earlier and pointed out that prices have been much higher in the recent past than historically than they are now. Do you have reason to think they'll move up considerably from where they are now, just given what the restrictions that China has imposed on imports? And what level of OCC prices do you prefer longer term?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Well, I'm not going to state a preference that I have one way or the other, but I would just say that on the OCC side, it's got to settle out at a point where it's profitable to collect and sell. So, when price points get too low, people tend to get out of the business, and more of it goes to landfill, and that certainly isn't anything anybody wants. And I can't tell you at all what China is going to do other than the fact that I've made the case numerous times, they have to have virgin fiber in order to run their paper system. So they're going to get virgin fiber one way or the other, and it's either going to be OCC and if it's OCC, it's going to be they're either going to relax their restrictions or they're going to have to pay more to the collectors to be able to put the capital in, to be able to sort it like China wants.","The other option is to buy more linerboard which their linerboard sales are up or sales, too, and their imports are up of linerboard. That's another way they can get virgin fiber. They've also got their own collection system going but the prices as I understand it right now in China, their own collection of OCC is about four times the price that it cost to import from the U.S. So, there's \u2013 I think there's just a whole dynamic going on there that it doesn't indicate to me that they're going to be out of the OCC business. I think it's bound to go back up but impossible for me to predict. I just think that it will find its level and it will level out at a certain point that makes sense for all the parties that are involved.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Sure. Thanks, Tom. And just one, you talked earlier about off-shoring and e-commerce and all that and obviously last year demand for the industry was up \u2013 significantly up about 2.5% actual which was much higher than it's been over the last 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, you name it, right? What do you think is a normalized level of growth for the industry? Do you think last year was indicative of what's to come or do you think it will settle out at a somewhat lower level than that for any particular reason? Thank you.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Tom, why don't you...","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","I think what we'll see is I think you'll see the business track GDP a lot closer than what it ever has. I mean, they got away from that for a while but I think we'll get back to basically tracking more like a GDP number.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks a lot, Tom.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Your line is open.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning, Anthony.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I just want to follow up on containerboard inventories. Last quarter, you talked about inventories being the lowest in four years. I think quarter-over-quarter, they were down another 23,000 tons. Can you just talk about your comfort level with inventories, especially as we go into kind of spring, summer season and freight being a little bit tighter and then to the extent that you're buying from the outside what that might look like on an annualized basis?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. As we've stated many, many times during this portion of the year as we go through our heavy shutdown periods and in light of the heavy demand, the mills have to run extremely well to supply our demand. As you would expect with the type of cut-up we've been experiencing, the inventories have declined. That's why it was imperative last fall or the fourth quarter to pre-build some inventory. And then again, we had to run hard. Fortunately, the pre-build paid off and also the mills performed in an outstanding manner. DeRidder came on and exceeded our expectations.","But nevertheless, we still have to run hard to get ourselves in a little bit more comfort zone with inventories going forward. We're into that second quarter into the third quarter, which is the heaviest quarters of the year for box demand. So, it behooves us to execute well, but again, that's a high-class problem.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Okay. And in terms of outage schedule for the rest of the year, obviously 1Q was your highest quarter. But as we think about 2Q, 3Q, 4Q, I think previously, you talked about $0.11 to $0.15, $0.16. Any update or changes to kind of the cadence of outages for the remaining three quarters of the year?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Bob, go ahead.","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","No. Anthony it's the same. It's what I gave you last call it's \u2013 that's what we're looking at for the balance of the year. So, you just have to keep in mind I was moving from sequentially within the same year now with the tax \u2013 the tax rate base will be the same as opposed to when you're looking at something year-over-year when we had the big change in our tax rate. But everything, the cadence is still the same.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. Got it. Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning, Debbie.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","You highlighted again earlier the attractiveness of bolt-on converting acquisitions which you've done pretty successfully. I wanted to get a sense of what's the next step here in terms of \u2013 is it the viability of the pipeline that is more or less attractive because we know that there aren't a lot of independents left, are there steps that you need to take such as increasing your containerboard capacity or regional exposure before you proceed?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","We've spoken about this in the last few earnings calls. We continue to have opportunities and we have numerous opportunities from internal projects to acquisitions of convertible assets, a number of opportunities. During this period of time, 2018, we've got our focus on just finishing up the work at Wallula and making sure that all the rest of the projects we have going on at the legacy mills continue to deliver results. And this is part of the question that was asked before you. We called out on January that we would continue to buy outside tons the rate we're buying last year which was about 250,000 tons of outside purchases. And so we have a number of means of supplying our box plant requirements. And so, I would just leave it at that. We never disclose a plan until, obviously, we're ready to announce something. Well, we have flexibility for the next number of years to do what we have to do to continue growing the business.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","All right. Thanks. And as my follow-up, you changed some of the language in your K around the attracting labor into the industry. I don't think there's anything new around that. But could you just walk through what you're doing to kind of an increased participation or make working in your industry more attractive for the labor force?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Well, I think, again, it's a matter of there's more competition for general labor. And so part of that is it's a competition based on willingness to pay several wages, and then the environment in terms of are you in a metropolitan region? Are you in a rural region? And so I think we have a good story to tell. But nevertheless, we are dealing in a highly competitive labor market currently which is not all bad.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","I would add, Debbie, that as an industry certainly on the corrugated box side of the business, as an industry, we've been working on attracting more to our industry for the better part of a couple of decades. And we put now equipment in schools around the country. We're working with voc techs, we're working with universities, two-year degree universities to introduce people into the industry. And this is above the design, the design cycle, which has been around for a long, long time. But this is really \u2013 is on the manufacturing side. So, I think that's been \u2013 that's worked very well for us, and has been attractive for us, and we're bringing in an even more qualified people even at the hourly level who are very promotable and had the desire to move up in the industry. So, those have been very helpful to our industry.","But that said, there's no question that labor is a key element that we're looking at since knowing full well that the costs are going up and that the quantity is going to be somewhat limited, so at least for the short-term.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. I'll turn it over.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Thank you.

Good morning.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning, Mark.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","I was hoping to get a sense historically on the box prices. How quickly you would tend to realize them, and maybe if we kind of just \u2013 I assume, you would have virtually nothing in that first month of March, but if you look back historically, and I don't know what's the kind of easiest way that you could say this so that it certainly is no competitive issue or whatever, but say within that four months, and the next three months, how much of a percentage of what you typically would get, or however you would want to provide any guidance you could, how much of it should we anticipate would show up in that \u2013 this three-month period?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. Tom, why don't you go ahead \u2013 get its \u2013 based on history.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. I'm just going to walk you through a little bit, Mark. I mean, of how we typically have done this. I mean starting out with a very disciplined approach. But keep in mind that we announced to our containerboard customers a $50 per ton increase effective March 1. We did begin billing in March for those containerboard customers. That was then reflected obviously in (43:31). And at that point, we then go out and we announced box price increase as well, but we don't get into specifics about it other than to say the triggering mechanisms on contracts and some of the other agreements that we have primarily mean that we've rolled this increase in over about a 90-day period. That's about all we typically would disclose on this just to give you a historical perspective.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And would it be possible if you look back historically in that first quarter, did you \u2013 because I assume this would be historical information, did you tend to get 20% of what you ended up with, 30%, 60%, just real ballpark type numbers?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","We just got \u2013 the number would be very small that we got, and so there's more to \u2013 there's obviously more to come.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay.

Just you would expect and what you're seeing in some of the publications, Pacific Northwest is \u2013 once again it continues to be amongst the highest in North America. You can understand that. And then we've had some weather phenomena in some regions of the southern portion, primarily mid-lower Alabama that impacts our Jackson mill with hardwood pricing and availability, and that's impacting the whole region down there. And then, again, just some localized weather events, but we're moving into warmer weather, but we're also moving into \u2013 a month from now, we'll be looking at hurricane season coming, so it's the typical weather event, but that's about it. All in all, fibers have been pretty flat with the exception of a little regional variation.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And if you look at the Pacific Northwest and some of the consolidation that's taking place there, are you seeing any disruption in the marketplace as you bring Wallula up around consolidation in the region?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","No, not really. We've been working for the better part of two years on how we line up our fiber supply agreements and where we're getting our fiber. And so, it's pretty \u2013 again, pretty flat in that regard to that whole region.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And just one clarification on Wallula. I think I heard you say you're going to bring that on line beginning in May. Can you just clarify that? And then, what percentage of the 400,000 ton capacity should we expect it to be running at in the beginning?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. What I said we'd be converting the machine during the month of May, and it goes down about second full week of May. And then it's down schedule wise until the first full week of June starting up. And so when it comes up because we are still lacking some key components of that on a delivery basis could not be delivered until the fall. It will \u2013 and it means that you'll be running the machine at little more than half of its production capacity in probably 220,000 ton a year run rate basis. And so, we'll run the summer at a slow back rate. And then when we get the final key elements to install in October, that will give us the capability to run at the full 400,000 ton run rate.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Just one quick follow-up there then. On the key components and obviously coming from equipment suppliers, are you seeing anything in relationship to lead times on equipment? I mean, is this sort of hitting at the conversion question whether or not lead times have really lengthened out on equipment suppliers into the industry?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","What we're seeing over the last two years, again, for critical components like headboxes and press sections, more technical complex components, you're out there 18 months, 20 months for delivery once you place orders. So, timing hasn't got any better, so planning is critical.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Mark.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Thank you. Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Chercover with Davidson. Your line is open.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Morning.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","So, first, with respect to maintenance, I generally thought that Q2 was traditionally the highest maintenance spend because that's when the weather is conducive. So, if Q1 the peak this year, so you can focus on the Wallula conversion?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Go ahead, Bob.","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","No.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Bring the color to that, because it's...","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah, I mean, you are talking about the maintenance outage, so the \u2013 we had the work at DeRidder as well as we had (49:13) and the number two machine out of Wallula all down at the same time which what made first quarter a heavier outage quarter than we typically had. That's really what drove that. It can change every year, but I wouldn't read any more into that.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Just we want to take a \u2013 we were ready and we wanted to take advantage of the fact that we could convert DeRidder in particular during that period of time and get it done with. And also, we needed \u2013 just from the human resource deployment and demands, we were able to take care of accounts in the number two machine out of Wallula over that same period of time. So, it was basically just spreading out some of the key activity but allowing us to really bring DeRidder on to see much more benefit of a full-year this year.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Yeah, I figured managerial bandwidth was part of it. And then, if I'm not mistaken, the ability to do pressure-sensitive and label at Wallula was an upgrade to that machine about a decade ago. Is there any equipment there that you might relocate to your other white paper operations, I Falls or Jackson?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","No.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Serious about that?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","That's a short answer.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","That's a short answer. Okay. Thank you.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gail Glazerman with Roe Equity Research. Your line is open.","Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning, Gail.","Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC","In terms of the demand front, any perspective on what the West Coast ag demand outlook is this year? I assume maybe you have a better peek into it with Sacramento. And also, with all the noise on potential trade wars brewing, is that a concern that you're hearing from customers? Any particular concern there in any end-markets and in particular that would be following that, that we should be thinking about?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Go ahead, Tom, again first part, and I'll answer the second part.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Gail, regarding West Coast ag, it looks like it's going to be a very busy year. The demand is very strong. So, that will \u2013 that obviously is a plus for us when you take into account Sacramento acquisition that we just made. Mark, do you want to...","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. And then on trade and what's going on, obviously, until we finally understand what is negotiated and what changes, you never know how it will turn out. Obviously, there's a lot of rhetoric coming out of Washington. But nevertheless, we deal with about 18,000 customers in the United States, making everything from manufactured goods to food products. And so, it's hard to imagine what that impact would be, so we'll just wait and see what trade negotiations (52:18).","Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC","Okay.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","It's not even worth speculating.","Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC","Okay. And then, there's obviously been a lot of talk in the investments you've been making on the mill side. Can you just give us an update and remind us what you have going on in terms of organic investment on the converting side?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Well, yeah, we've talked about some projects. You get into a few specifics. Tom, do you want to talk about the new plant we're building?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. Gail, we obviously always have a lot of capital going into the box plants. We've recapitalized that consistently over the years. We think as well or better than anybody else in the industry. We've got a couple of big projects going on right now. We're building a new plant in Marshfield, Wisconsin. We've also got large capital expansions going on in the Pennsylvania, Virginia region. And just a lot of projects going on all over. When you've got virtually 100 plants, there's a lot of things going on at all times. And it all goes back to what we discussed earlier. This financial flexibility that we have really allows us to do the things that we need to do, driven around what our customers need and what their demands are.","Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks for taking my follow-ups. Bob, just on the tax side, can you help us with what your expected 2Q tax rate will be compared to the 25% in 1Q? I know you mentioned it would be slightly lower sequentially. And then can you help me with what your long-term cash tax rate expectation is, just in light of the change you made to your 2018 guidance?","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. In the second quarter, Adam, it goes down to just under 24% where the effective tax rate is. And that's why it was mentioned in our guidance, while we get a little benefit (54:18). It really has nothing to do with tax reform. It has to do with this accounting change that was made last year around employee share-based accounting and how it's recorded now in tax expense rather than in equity. And when you have like we do in the second quarter, the majority of our restricted stock and so forth vest during that quarter, the difference between the grant date and the actual date that at best creates that noise. We have the same thing when we went from the first quarter to the second quarter last year went down for the same reason.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And on the cash tax side, Bob, longer term?","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. It's the same range that I gave earlier, Adam. As you know, we just gave what it is for the year. And I've mentioned that the cash tax rate went up a bit because of what the states were doing. And again, the range -- our new range for this year is 14% to 16%. But if you take out the overpayment that was made, it's on a normal basis. It would be swinging at 19% to 21% range.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. Thank you for that clarification. And Mark, just on the paper business, your volume was up in the quarter. Was there any pre-buy just ahead of your announced price increases? And then, in terms of industry demand, it was down about 5% last year. It's been a little better so far this year. Do you have any particular expectation for what industry demand will look like compared to last year?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","On the first part, you'd have to assume it went a little bit pre-buying. It wasn't \u2013 probably wasn't that much, but we have assumed there was some pre-buy. And then, on the second part of your question, what the volume would look like, I think the key part is that if you went back in the last seven years or eight years and look at what the slope of the curve was supposed to look like, we've flattened out considerably in the demand destruction portion of that curve. And so, let's say, I think \u2013 and it also speaks about the strong economy and use of paper, so.","But again, with Wallula going out of the production, we're down to a two-machine paper business. So, it goes back, and we have a nice tidy two mill business, Jackson, and I Falls with the four machines running, supplying both new supplies. So, I'm not going to worry about what happens around the world, and it's just the business generates a lot of cash. And that generally require a lot of capital as we've said a number of times.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Mark, thank you, and best of luck.","Mark W.

Your host today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chief Executive Officer of PCA. Upon conclusion of his narrative, there will be a Q&A session.","I will now turn the conference call over to Mr. Kowlzan. Please proceed when you are ready.","Mark Kowlzan","Good morning and thanks for participating in Packaging Corporation of America\u2019s third quarter earnings release conference call. I\u2019m Mark Kowlzan, CEO of PCA, and with me on the call today is Paul Stecko, our Chairman; Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President who runs our packaging business; Judy Lassa, Senior Vice President who runs our white papers business, and Rick West, our Chief Financial Officer.","I\u2019ll begin the call with an overview of our third quarter results and then turn the call over to Tom, Judy and Rick who will provide more details. I\u2019ll then wrap things up and we\u2019ll be glad to take any questions.","Yesterday we reported third quarter net income of $104 million or $1.06 per share. Third quarter net income included after-tax charges for the Boise integration, debt refinancing, and DeRidder mill restructuring of $20 million or $0.20 per share, including cash charges of $6 million or $0.06 per share and non-cash charges of $14 million or $0.14 per share. Excluding these special items, third quarter 2014 net income was $124 million or $1.26 per share compared to the third quarter of 2013 net income of $89 million or $0.92 per share and compared to the second quarter of 2014 net income of $114 million or $1.16 per share. Details of special items are shown on the schedules that were included with the press release.","Third quarter net sales were $1,519 million compared to third quarter 2013 net sales of $845 million and second quarter 2014 net sales of $1,468 million. Excluding special items, the $0.10 per share increase in third quarter 2014 earnings compared to the second quarter of 2014 earnings was driven by increased sales volume and improved mix for $0.12, lower fuel costs $0.02, and lower chemical and recycled fiber costs $0.02. These items were partially offset by higher annual outage costs of $0.03, higher electricity costs $0.02, and higher medical and workers\u2019 compensation costs $0.02. ","This was our eighth consecutive quarter of record earnings, excluding special items, driven in part by strong sales volume, record mill productivity, and mill cost reductions. The integration of Boise Packaging continues to generate significant synergies and operational improvements in the white papers that resulted in lower costs and higher margins. At the end of the third quarter, realized annual synergies were at a run rate of about $110 million, up from about 85 to $90 million at the end of the second quarter, and we continue to expect synergies of at least $175 million by the end of 2016. ","We have also achieved a significant strategic milestone on October 17 with the completion of the Number 3 newsprint machine conversion at the DeRidder, Louisiana mill to produce containerboard. This work was completed two weeks ahead of schedule and the start-up of the machine is on plan with no major production or quality issues so far. In addition to providing needed capacity, we\u2019re excited about the grade optimization potential and freight savings that the D3 machine will bring going forward.","Looking at the details of our third quarter operations, packaging EBITDA excluding special items was $262 million on sales of $1,176 million, which equates to 22.3% margins. Containerboard production was a record 858,000 tons, up 12,000 tons over second quarter of this year. Our Valdosta mill was down seven days during the quarter for its annual maintenance outage, reducing containerboard production about 11,000 tons. In addition, we completed planned boiler and (indiscernible) repairs at our DeRidder mill and also in the fourth quarter our Wallula, Washington No. 2 medium machine will be down for five days for its annual maintenance outage, which will reduce production by about 2,000 tons. ","Containerboard inventories at the end of September were down 7,000 tons compared to the end of second quarter but up 21,000 tons since the beginning of the year, including an increase of 4,000 tons with the April 2014 acquisition of Crockett Packaging. The remaining 17,000 ton increase was the result of our decision to increase our containerboard inventories, some at our box plants to improve and optimize supply assurance and transportation costs.","The rail and truck issues that we spoke about during our second quarter earnings call in July did not improve during the third quarter. Fortunately with our inventory adjustment and our day-to-day management of the situation, we\u2019ve been able to limit some of the impact on transportation costs.","Our integration level in the third quarter was 92%, and to meet our total containerboard demand we purchased 47,000 tons of containerboard from the outside market. Our year-to-date purchases of containerboard were 147,000 tons. With the start-up of the DeRidder No. 3 paper machine, most of these outside purchases will be eliminated and we will only purchase some specialty grades that we do not produce.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Tom, who will provide more details on PCA\u2019s containerboard and corrugated packaging sales and demand.","Tom Hassfurther","Thank you, Mark. Our containerboard and corrugated products demand was strong and steady throughout the quarter. With the acquisition of Boise, overall corrugated product shipments were up 33% over the third quarter of last year. Excluding Boise, PCA shipments were up 6.2% in total and were up 4.5% per workday with one additional workday in this year\u2019s third quarter. The acquisition of Crockett Packaging in April of 2014 contributed about 1.5% of the shipments increase.","Industry corrugated product shipments were reported last week and total shipments were up 1.7% and shipments per workday were essentially flat for the third quarter. PCA prices for corrugated products increased slightly compared to the second quarter, driven in part by a richer mix. ","Our outside sales of containerboard were up 8,000 tons compared to the second quarter and down 19,000 tons compared to the third quarter of last year, including Boise tons in both years. We reduced both domestic and export sales and increased our integration level from 88% in the third quarter of last year to 92%. Pricing for domestic sales of containerboard was essentially the same as the second quarter. Export prices were down about $10 per ton on average, but pricing stabilized and began to increase late in the quarter. For the first 10 days of October, PCA bookings for corrugated products are up 5.6% over the same period last year and billings are up 4.5%, so we are off to a good start in the fourth quarter; however, we do expect corrugated product shipments in the fourth quarter to be lower than in the third quarter with three less shipping days and some seasonal slowdown in demand that usually occurs during the Christmas holiday period.","I will now turn it over to Judy Lassa, who will discuss white papers.","Judy Lassa","Thank you, Tom. Our paper segment EBITDA in the third quarter of 2014, excluding special items, was $56 million on sales of $313 million, which equated to about an 18% margin compared to just over a 15% margin in the second quarter. This margin improvement was driven primarily by higher volume and improved operations, and lower costs in our white paper mills. Our white paper mills ran extremely well, producing 296,000 tons. We had no annual maintenance outages in the quarter. We will have our Jackson, Alabama mill down for seven days in November for its annual maintenance outage, which will result in lower production by 9,000 tons and higher operating costs. We did build some paper inventories at the end of the quarter, up about 6,000 tons compared to the end of second quarter, and that\u2019s primarily related to the planned outage at Jackson. ","Office paper shipments during the third quarter were up 7.3% over the second quarter this year and were down 5.4% compared to the third quarter of last year. During the past year, we elected to exit some business which did reduce our shipments. Printing and converting and pressure-sensitive shipments were up 3,000 tons compared to the second quarter and down about 22,000 tons compared to last year\u2019s third quarter. That is as a result of the fourth quarter 2013 paper machine closures at the International Falls, Minnesota mill. ","Finally, white paper prices were essentially flat in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, and looking at the fourth quarter we expect to see seasonally lower white paper shipments and higher fuel costs at our International Falls, Minnesota paper mill with the onset of winter conditions.","I will now turn it over to Rick West.","Richard West","Thank you, Judy. Looking at other company-wide cost and earnings change items from second quarter results, amortization of annual outage repair costs and direct outage costs increased $0.03 per share, which was in line with our expectations. We saw expected seasonally higher prices for electricity of $0.02 per share and our medical and workers\u2019 compensation costs were up $0.02 per share.","Moving to cash generation and use for the third quarter, PCA generated cash from operations of $223 million. Capital expenditures were $107 million during the quarter, and year-to-date capital expenditures are $255 million. Common stock dividends of $39 million were paid or $0.40 per share. We made $53 million of cash tax payments, and we also paid off $75 million of long-term debt. Total debt reduction since the acquisition of Boise on October 25, 2013 is $300 million, and our long-term debt is now at $2,357 million. We ended the quarter with $154 million in cash on hand.","To reduce the earnings risk of potential interest rate increases on variable interest rate debt, we issued $400 million of 10-year notes with a fixed interest rate of 3.65% in the third quarter and used the proceeds to pay down a portion of our bank term loan debt. ","I will now turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Kowlzan","","Thank you, Rick. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, with the DeRidder conversion we expect higher mill production which will allow us to reduce our outside purchases of containerboard. Corrugated product shipments are expected to be lower with three less shipping days compared to the third quarter, and we also expect seasonally lower white paper shipments. Amortization of annual outage repair costs will be about $0.07 per share higher than in third quarter and we expect seasonal increases in fuel and transportation costs. Considering these items, we expect fourth quarter earnings of $1.16 per share excluding special items. ","With that, we\u2019d be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you some of the statements we\u2019ve made on the call constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.","With that, Operator, I\u2019d like to open the call for questions. Thank you.","Question and Answer Session","","Operator","[Operator instructions]","The first question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. ","Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research","Thank you, good morning. Two quick ones. One, the September refinancing, so when you had originally completed the Boise transaction, you talked about paying down a billion dollars of debt subsequently. I think with this refinancing where you took advantage of very low rates, does that change your thinking on the need to necessarily pay down a billion dollars in a specified time frame?","Mark Kowlzan","Mark, regarding that, we took advantage of that opportunity with the interest rate to give us flexibility, but also I think the timing of our plan is still to pay down the billion dollars of debt over the next couple of years, so that target hasn\u2019t changed but we did want to take care of some of the uncertainty.","Rick, did you want to add anything?","Richard West","No, except Mark, we still have over $700 million of variable rated debt, so we can continue to pay down our term loans until they are completely paid out with this refinancing.","Paul Stecko","And I\u2019d add \u2013 this is Paul, Mark. This does give\u2014as Mark pointed out, flexibility is the key word. We wanted to get our debt down because it was variable and you never know what will happen, but we just took $400 million off the table that just put us at risk, and so paying down a billion in three years is still a goal but if it took 3.5 or 4 and we had a better use for the money vis-\u00e0-vis dividend or share buyback, we\u2019re in a position that allows us to do what is the best thing and not be totally tied to this commitment to pay down a billion in three years. So we\u2019ve built some flexibility for ourselves that allows us to take advantage of whatever happens in the marketplace.","Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research","Thank you, makes a lot of sense. There has been a lot of talk on MLP, and is that something that you guys have had a chance to take a look at, and do you have any thoughts at this stage?","Mark Kowlzan","Yeah Mark, we\u2019ve spent a lot of time on this and we have a good appreciation of its merits, both financially and strategically. We\u2019ve engaged legal and financial assistance to provide the information that would allow us to submit a request to the IRS for a private letter ruling, but obviously the big unknown is when the IRS will lift this moratorium on the MLPs and more importantly what are the rulings and the substance of any private letter request. I think again this information will impact if and how we proceed with any MLP consideration.","Paul, do you have anything you want to add to that?","Paul Stecko","The only thing that I\u2019d add is that I\u2019ve been looking at this, along with Mark and Rick and Kent Pflederer, our General Counsel, but I\u2019ve kind of just tried to stay focused on the strategic aspects and the shareholder value creation, as opposed to the mechanics and the structure of setting one of these things up. They\u2019re kind of interesting \u2013 you know, MLPs can create shareholder value from my perspective in a couple ways. The first is the traditional way, related to the value arbitrage, if you will, that results in selling a cash drain that\u2019s tax advantaged for a higher multiple than your stock is trading, and the multiple that you end up getting is going to be a function of how the MLP investors view the security of that cash flow stream and what ability you have to increase distribution of that cash flow by puts down of additional cash flow from the parent company to the MLP over time, so that\u2019s how it basically works.","But there\u2019s a second and very important way that you could also create value, and that\u2019s referred to as third party growth. This growth is in addition to simply pushing down a larger percentage of your existing cash flow to MLPs. This new growth results from what value you get from redeploying the proceeds that you receive from the MLP investors, and as you know, this redeployment could be pay down debt, increase the dividend, buy back shares, or reinvest into the business. In this regard with regard to reinvesting into the business, I think PCA has generated a track record over the last 10, 15 years of judiciously applying capital and obtaining superior returns for the shareholders. Our recent energy projects at Counce and Valdosta and our Boise acquisition are good examples of this.","We think that our ability to redeploy assets should resonate well with any potential MLP investors, and this can create a lot of value for both the MLP investors and the PCA shareholders. So this thing is very attractive, especially if you can generate value in both ways, and it\u2019s something that we consider to learn more and more about each day, but as Mark says, we can\u2019t do anything until we hear what comes out of Washington.","Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research","That\u2019s tremendously helpful. So recognizing you\u2019ve got to wait to hear something from Washington, it sounds like you\u2019re relatively comfortable with whatever complexities that the structure would entail. Is that fair?","Paul Stecko","Let me turn it over to our structure man, Rick.","Richard West","Well Mark, we\u2019re basically in the preliminary evaluation phase. As Mark said, we\u2019ve engaged auditors, legal and other advisors to look at what we would need to do for setting up the initial MLP IPO for carve-out audited financials, but we\u2019re also beginning to look at the changes that would be needed with an MLP reporting structure, but we\u2019re really in the early stages of that work and we\u2019re continuing to look at each of the aspects of what we would need to do to operate on a daily basis with this type structure. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re at \u2013 the preliminary evaluation phase, but we\u2019re taking the time and effort to effectively look at it as how we can best operate in the future if that were to take place.","Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research","Thank you very much.","Mark Kowlzan","Next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon of Vertical Research.","Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research ","Yes, good morning. First question is just on the state of the market. A big dilemma we\u2019ve all faced, and I\u2019m sure you all have too, is the sort of decoupling of box demand with GDP that we\u2019ve seen in the past few years with the outsourcing that seems to have come to an end. We got, I guess, a hint in September that maybe we\u2019re recoupling, and I know it\u2019s hard to say with just a few months of data and finally seeing the economy get some life, but what are your thoughts about that? As you look at your current customer mix, do you think you\u2019re going to see at least the industry tie its shipments more closely to the growth in GDP than we\u2019ve seen in the last 15 years?","Tom Hassfurther","Chip, this is Tom. Let me see if I can take a stab at this. I think where we are, at least in the short term here, is as business has grown, manufacturing has improved somewhat. A lot of that has been in the durables area, and some of those industries don\u2019t use a lot of corrugated; but the indicators are going forward that I think you\u2019re going to see a little more in the non-durables area, and especially in light of the fact that the employment levels are improving, wages are going up, gasoline prices of course are coming down quite significantly, which puts a lot more money in consumers\u2019 pockets, and therefore I think that will start to really begin to drive the non-durables area, which is much more tied to corrugated demand.","So I think that when you look at a total GDP number, it can be a little misleading from the standpoint of it depends on where the growth is coming from and how much use happens to be in the corrugated area. But when you look at non-durables, that\u2019s very much tied to corrugated and I think we\u2019ve got some definite upside there.","Mark Kowlzan","Yeah, let me just build on that. Tom said something very important here about non-durables. If you go back, Chip, it has to be at least 10 years, though my memory is failing me there, but one of the first real tips we had in corrugated demand was the first time gasoline prices spiked up a lot, and that sucked a lot of disposable income out of the economy. That disposable income was maybe $100 a month for everybody that drives a car, and so they weren\u2019t going to buy a big non-durable\u2014a big durable good with that money, they were going to spend that money on things packed in a corrugated container and not on gasoline, because as you know, we don\u2019t ship a lot of gasoline in corrugated containers. ","So if getting gasoline prices\u2014if they can fall in the short term, that\u2019s a big plus for corrugated because that disposable income will go somewhere, and wherever it goes, most of it is going to be packed in a box. So we also root for lower gasoline prices at PCA \u2013 it helps transportation expenses, too.","Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research","Got you, that\u2019s very helpful. I guess shifting gears a little bit, I know you guys certainly\u2014of late certainly have shown a great alacrity in adding to shareholder value. I\u2019m just sort of looking here at\u2014you know, the net debt is down to $2.2 billion, you\u2019re roughly a third of the way through your debt repayment plan that you had discussed after the Boise deal. But it\u2019s interesting \u2013 when you look at your EBITDA is arguably going to be less than two times\u2014I\u2019m sorry, a little more than half of that net debt level, so you\u2019re less than two times leveraged already as we look at next year. I just wanted to sort of take a temperature and see, would that at least allow you to consider the dividend as a potential increase candidate, and also given your success in making acquisitions, are you considering that you\u2019re still open for business or do you still want to get that debt down even further before you\u2019d consider that?","Mark Kowlzan","You know, I think it goes back to the word, flexibility, that I used earlier. I think where we are right now, we\u2019ve got these options to consider and that\u2019s something that as time goes on, we\u2019ll be discussing with the board. The fact that we have paid down $300 million and where we are with the business, it gives us a lot of firepower to move in different directions, whether it\u2019s dividend increases. I think on the acquisition side right now, obviously we\u2019re still focused pretty heavily on the completion of this integration, so that\u2019s less of an interest to us immediately but that doesn\u2019t say that going forward, if an opportunity came along, we certainly would have to consider that.","But again, I think right now we\u2019re very comfortable and we\u2019ve got tremendous flexibility to move that cash and best deploy it.","Paul?","Paul Stecko","Chip, we mentioned on the previous caller \u2013 you probably didn\u2019t hear it, but you were holding on the line \u2013 we also refinanced $400 million in variable debt and got very attractive rates on 10 years. That gave us a lot of flexibility to put us in a position to consider the things you\u2019re talking about.","Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research","Got you. Real quickly \u2013 could you talk a little bit about the increased integration we\u2019ve seen? I mean, you guys are buying box plants. We saw another big deal down in the southwest. How much of the non-integrated business is left, and do you think that could discourage new capacity aimed at the independents, since it seems like there\u2019s not that many left?","Tom Hassfurther","Chip, this is Tom. I think you were getting at getting a real handle on what\u2019s going on in the marketplace, and certainly see it very much like we see it. So I think that our strategy to get to 90%-plus integration, which is where we are and we intend to even do more, is a sound strategy and certainly given what\u2019s going on in the rest of the marketplace. And of course, you know have even\u2014if you observe if you\u2019ve got some direct mill owners who had no cut-up at all who are now\u2014have now actively pursued some acquisitions, so it\u2019s a bit of a change in the marketplace.","Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research","Very helpful, thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of George Staphos of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ","George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America ","","Thanks everyone, good morning. I wanted to go back to MLPs, just a couple of questions. Remembering that flexibility is one of your bigger watch words at Packaging Corp, would it be safe to say that until you ultimately come to a decision on MLPs and for that matter get the appropriate signals one way or another from Washington, that bigger capital allocation decisions might be on hold, or will you look at these are parallel and independent decisions that you need to look at?","Mark Kowlzan","I think the latter part \u2013 you know, we will continue in parallel and look at opportunities as they come along. Obviously we wouldn\u2019t want to pass up on something that was a good opportunity for the shareholders anticipating something out of Washington. I think the key right now is for us to be prepared and understand what the implications are of a private letter ruling, which we are; but in the meantime, we\u2019re going to continue running the business and provide value to the shareholders in the ways that we\u2019ve done historically.","Paul Stecko","Back on that flexibility, we\u2019re going to sound like a broken record and we\u2019ve said this for 10 years. We\u2019re not smart enough to predict the future, but we\u2019re know we\u2019re not smart enough to predict the future so we take another way out \u2013 build in flexibility, and that allows you to capitalize on the future, whatever it may be. Again, paying down or converting this debt we had, $400 million, to fixed rate gives us some flexibility to pursue, in your term, a parallel and independent course. So we\u2019ve got the firepower, we think, now to do a lot more different things than we had six months ago.","George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America","Paul, another question, and maybe this is somewhat preliminary. Again, as you\u2019ve studied MLPs and what the investor base and investment MLPs values perhaps somewhat differently than traditional, if you will, paper and forest investors might look at or value, do you envision any changes in the actual business model? I\u2019m not getting into mechanics now in terms of what assets might or might not be in an MLP or (indiscernible) and what would remain with the parent, but more in terms of the integrated containerboard business, do you perhaps run it differently if it were part of an enterprise that had MLPs than what you\u2019re doing currently? If so, what would those changes maybe look like?","Paul Stecko","Yeah, that\u2019s a very easy question to answer. The answer is no, we wouldn\u2019t run it any differently. We have a business model that works and no matter what vehicle you have for transferring value to shareholders or creating value for shareholders, in the end it comes down to your primary business model. If you\u2019ve got a lousy business model, there\u2019s nothing you can do to improve shareholder value. As they say, cash is cash, and our business model, as you know, has been performing at a very high level for a long time. That\u2019s the last thing we\u2019d change.","George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America","Understood. I appreciate that, Paul. Two last ones and then I\u2019ll turn it over, both on operations. Can you comment at all in terms of how D3\u2019s start-up might be built into your guidance for fourth quarter? You obviously mentioned it will be more in the way of production, obviously, but what should we factor in perhaps for start-up costs or incremental EBITDA, if that\u2019s possible to comment on? And the down time in the third quarter in packaging was 11,000 tons, I think you said in total; initial guidance was 13,000 tons. Obviously it was a good operating quarter \u2013 you already said that, but were there any specific things that really went well in bringing back up Valdosta? Thanks, and good luck in the quarter.","Mark Kowlzan","On the first part regarding DeRidder, we\u2019ve only been running for four days; this will be our fifth day of running, so it\u2019s early. We\u2019re obviously pleased with what we\u2019re seeing so far, but we\u2019ve got just\u2014like I say, we\u2019re in the start-up phase. But we\u2019ve been conservative in building contributions to fourth quarter earnings. I think a better way of looking at that is to understand going forward, if you assume we get through the start-up curve with no problems and we\u2019re producing according to the original plan, on a quarter-over-quarter basis, Rick, you can build that for them, and I understand it was $115 million capital and about 30% returns, so that would give after-tax contribution of--?","Richard West","Yes, Mark. You know, with that what we\u2019ve said previously with the 30% return at the capital, you\u2019re looking at a project that\u2019s going to generate on an annual basis when fully operating rough numbers about $60 million of EBITDA or about $0.36 per share on an annual basis. So of course, that would be about $0.09 per share per quarter, and if you look at the fourth quarter, the machine is not operating essentially the first month, October, and you\u2019ve got start-up costs as you mentioned, so that\u2019s what Mark was alluding to. What we\u2019ve put into the guidance is something\u2014you know, you\u2019re almost guessing at this point.","Mark Kowlzan","Yeah George, let me just amplify on that. When you start up the paper machine, and you know of examples where others have done this, it doesn\u2019t go well. You actually lose money the first quarter you start it up because you don\u2019t run very well, and all that overhead that the newsprint machine was covering, and although you were only breaking even with newsprint, it covered a lot of overhead. So this machine doesn\u2019t run well, it could actually hurt fourth quarter earnings.","Now, we don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be the case. We\u2019ve been running for five days and there\u2019s been no showstoppers, but we\u2019ve got a long way to go. Depending how well this machine ramps up, depending on a lot of things, we\u2019ll make money in the fourth quarter. It\u2019s a tougher guess than normal because it\u2019s easy to make a forecast on a machine that you\u2019ve run for 10 years \u2013 you know how it behaves, you know what cold weather does to it, you know a lot of other things. But with a start-up like this, it\u2019s plus or minus 50%, just to grab a number.","So we\u2019ve put a number in. At the end of the quarter, we\u2019ll see if we were close. We\u2019re hoping it\u2019s better and we\u2019re hoping it\u2019s not worse, but we really don\u2019t want to give guidance. We don\u2019t want to throw that number out, because there is so much uncertainty around it. Throwing out a number tends to validate it, and it tends to maybe mislead investors that we\u2019re overconfident in something. Right now, we\u2019re in a learning phase \u2013 so far so good, but so far is the operative phrase.","George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America","Understood.","Tom Hassfurther","Then regarding the last part of your question on tons, the difference in the containerboard, we had originally planned to have the Wallula No. 2 machine outage in the third quarter, and that was moved into the third quarter so that\u2019s a couple of thousand tons of difference.","George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America","Okay, thanks. I\u2019ll turn it over. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettanari of Citi.","Anthony Pettanari \u2013 Citibank","Good morning. I was wondering how volumes trended over three quarters\u2014sorry, the three months of the quarter, and then the industry data for September shipments seemed incrementally positive. You talked about bookings and billings being up 4 to 5% in October. Are you seeing sort of an acceleration of box demand, or has it been mostly stable, or was it stable throughout the quarter or is there any kind of color you can give us there?","Tom Hassfurther","Anthony, this is Tom. The volume trend through the quarter was relatively steady. We kind of built up into this September time frame somewhat because of the holiday season and our specialty graphics business does come up a little bit at that point in time. Box demand though overall, I would say is pretty steady and we\u2019ll see the same thing in the fourth quarter, with the exception of the end of the year when we have a little bit of a holiday slowdown.","Anthony Pettanari \u2013 Citibank","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Then maybe just turning over to MLPs, Rick, you indicated that you\u2019re at a preliminary stage of investigation. I\u2019m just wondering, assuming that the IRS pause or the government was not an issue, how long do you think it will take you internally to really make a decision or to feel that you\u2019ve completed your analysis on the MLP front? How long do you think that would take?","Richard West","I really can\u2019t comment on that right now, Anthony. You need to go in and look at\u2014you know, there\u2019s a number of things you have to do in terms of auditing and carve-out financials. We\u2019re in the preliminary evaluation of that phase, and you always want to have a look at what do you want to do in advance and what do you want to wait to do until you have more clarification on what a potential MLP could look like. So we don\u2019t want to waste a lot of time doing things until we kind of know a structure of what one could look like, but there are some things you can do in advance to prepare yourself. ","But at this point, I couldn\u2019t give you a time frame that we could be ready or how long it would take, but I can tell you that we\u2019ll be in a much better position to do so in the next few months.","Mark Kowlzan","The only real broad calibration we could give you \u2013 you know, it won\u2019t be in terms of days or years. It will be in terms of months.","Anthony Pettanari \u2013 Citibank","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you, good morning guys. A couple of questions. So in terms of the IRS moratorium, do you have any visibility on the timing around when we may hear back? Do you think we\u2019d hear something before the end of the year, or do you have any visibility around that at all that you can share with us?","Mark Kowlzan","The latest is that they\u2019re saying by the end of the fall. The problem is, the fall ends in December, so that would be government\u2019s latest.","Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Fall of \u201914, Mark?","Mark Kowlzan","Well, that\u2019s what\u2014but again, you know, two months ago they were saying August and September, so the number, the date keeps shifting with the government. Our ability to handicap when that happens is approaching zero.","Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Understood. Appreciate the honesty there. Then just on D3, so it\u2019s being ramped into the seasonally slow part of the year. The market participants that sort of have a really good feel on what\u2019s happening are characterizing it as a very sloppy market now, so how do you balance bringing on new supply, at the same time continuing to manage price costs in an efficient and effective manner?","Tom Hassfurther Mark Kowlzan","Well again, as we talked about through the second quarter call, we had a home for the tons and basically the tons are already sold to our system, so we\u2019re in the process of reducing outside purchases. We plan to build some inventory during the quarter and get ready for the annual outages in the first quarter of next year \u2013 we\u2019re going to have our Counce and DeRidder No. 1 machines down in the first quarter of next year.","So essentially again, we have a home for all the tons we plan on making, and as usual we plan on running to demand.","Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got you.","Paul Stecko","To build on that, we have two\u2014we\u2019re up and beginning the first quarter downtime at this point, but we\u2019ve got our two biggest mills, DeRidder and Counce, will be down in the first quarter, so our challenge with D3 is not to sell the tons. Our challenge is to make enough so that we can supply our current demand and build a little bit of inventory to support our first quarter shutdowns. So the pressure is on the mill to produce. Tom Hassfurther does not have nearly as much pressure in selling the tons because we need them, we\u2019ve got a home for them.","Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got you, Paul \u2013 okay. If I could just ask one more real quick one, do you guys have a net debt to EBITDA leverage target in mind below which it wouldn\u2019t make much sense to pay down debt from an official capital allocation perspective?","Richard West","You know, everybody asks that question, and we really don\u2019t because you can control the debt side of it but you can\u2019t control the EBITDA side of it. You know, you could look at\u2014we\u2019re at about 2.1 right now debt to EBITDA. Some would say that\u2019s a very good number, but it\u2019s not good enough for us because the flexibility we want, if by some unusual chance, as it did in 2008 and 2009, that EBITDA dropped. So we like the flexibility. Could you put a number out there? Maybe 1.5, but that\u2019s not something we hang our hat on. We keep the flexibility, as we\u2019ve said previously.","Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Good stuff. Thank you very much, everybody.","Operator","The next question comes from Mark Connelly with CLSA.","Mark Connelly \u2013 CLSA","Thanks. I wonder if we could go back to Tom\u2019s comments about integration. Containerboard is pretty profitable right now and building new capacity seems pretty profitable, too; so might it make sense to get short and stay short for the next couple of years, and then think about your integrated strategy longer term than that?","Tom Hassfurther","You know, Mark, I\u2019m really not going to comment on that. I would just stay with the previous comments that I made and then you could draw whatever conclusions you want to on that. We\u2019re in an industry that\u2019s running 97.7% operating rates, so it seems at this point in time obviously whatever is produced primarily has a home. You\u2019d be hard-pressed to find any other industry running at this kind of rate. We\u2019ll just leave it at that.","Mark Connelly \u2013 CLSA","Okay. So can we switch to white paper for a second? Your revenue per ton was off a little bit. Was that price or was that mix, and can you tell us what\u2019s happening in the mix?","Judy Lassa","This is Judy. Our mix is shifting around a bit just because of our change in customer mix, but we are basically on track with where we were planning to be.","Mark Connelly \u2013 CLSA","So prices are flat?","Judy Lassa","Flat pricing for third quarter.","Mark Kowlzan","Third quarter essentially was flat, Mark.","Mark Connelly \u2013 CLSA","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies.","Philip Ng \u2013 Jefferies","Hey, good morning guys. DeRidder is coming on pretty nicely, but as you pointed out, there\u2019s a ramp-up start-up cost and all that good stuff. How should we think about the impact, the incremental tons going to \u201915, on your mix and margin, especially in the first year?","Mark Kowlzan","Well again, as Rick pointed out, on a going forward basis in an ideal world, what was that, Rick \u2013 about $0.36 on an annual basis of contribution on earnings per share?","Richard West","That\u2019s right.","Mark Kowlzan","And then again, understanding that we think we know what the machine is designed to do, but we\u2019re learning about that every day right now. So our plan is just what it\u2019s always been with the rest of our legacy system \u2013 we\u2019ll run to demand.","Tom Hassfurther","We don\u2019t give projections for the full year. We give guidance a quarter ahead, so every quarter you\u2019re going to learn more and more about that machine.","Philip Ng \u2013 Jefferies","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Then in terms of capital investments on the horizon, you guys have obviously done a great job on the energy projects and the D3. But part of the attraction, as you pointed out earlier on the MLP front, is potential investments of that cash flow that you would get from an MLP event. Would that be more geared towards acquisitions, or you still do see a good amount of capital reinvestment opportunities down the road in your business?","Mark Kowlzan","Well, both. We\u2019ll continue to take advantage of opportunities and acquisitions of the box plant businesses, and also keep reinvesting in the existing assets in terms of energy and productivity improvements. Again, I think if you step back and look at the margin gains in the white paper business, a great deal of that margin gain over the last 11 months came from operational improvements and efficiencies in the white paper mills through hundreds of investments in fixing assets and new bolt-on technologies. So the answer is both, and a myriad of opportunities.","Philip Ng \u2013 Jefferies","Okay. I know exports are not a big part of your business, but you did give some color on prices ticking back up. Where are you seeing export prices move higher, and how should we be thinking about just demand overall? It\u2019s actually been quite strong on the export front, but we\u2019ve seen the U.S. dollar tick up and there\u2019s some concerns about global growth slowing down a bit.","Tom Hassfurther","Yeah Phil, this is Tom. Regarding exports, again I\u2019ll just say we\u2019re a small player, getting limited markets, and we\u2019re very specialized in exports. So for me to give you a broad perspective of what\u2019s going on in exports is a little bit difficult. As I mentioned, our prices have started to tick up again a little bit and primarily in the Europe market, but we have currency issues. There\u2019s a whole myriad of things that go on in that export market, and the strength of those markets tends to move around the world. Europe was strong; they're a little bit weaker now. South America has picked up, so it\u2019s just\u2014you know, on any given day it can look a little bit different.","Philip Ng \u2013 Jefferies","Okay, good luck in the quarter, guys.","Operator","The next question is from Debbie Jones of Deutsche Bank.","Debbie Jones \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi, good morning. Just wondering, looking at the bigger picture in paper, what your thoughts are on how the industry or PKG will manage the continued decline in white paper going forward, and then if you have any thoughts on the impact of imports over the next six to 12 months and the ability to sustain prices in this business. ","Judy Lassa","This is Judy. So I\u2019m going to decouple demand with shipments. In looking at demand, they fall in between that 3 to 5% range that we thought we were, so we think we\u2019re right in line with where we think demand is. I can\u2019t comment on impact on the industry on the import piece of things, but we think\u2014we believe that it\u2019s having maybe some impact on the market, but we are not impacted as much because of our customer mix.","Debbie Jones \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, thanks. That\u2019s helpful. If I could just get in my MLP question, is it possible with your preliminary analysis, could this type of structure could be potentially applied to your papers business? I\u2019ve heard a few opinions that this could also be applied to recycled containerboard, which seems like a stretch, but I was wondering if you think either of those options could be on the table if the moratorium is lifted.","Richard West","I think it\u2019s too preliminary. I think everyone needs to wait until we have better indication from the IRS about what would qualify or if anything would qualify. So I really would not want to speculate on the products that could potentially be within an MLP structure.","Debbie Jones \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, thanks very much.","Paul Stecko","Yeah, we just want to stay away from sheer speculation. If we knew something, we\u2019d tell you; but you\u2019re in the area of sheer speculation and we really just don\u2019t like to do that.","Debbie Jones \u2013 Deutsche Bank","No, and I appreciate that. I think that part of the problem is there is a lot of speculation out there, so just getting an idea of maybe what\u2019s off the table could be helpful. But anyways, thank you very much and I\u2019ll pass it on.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo.","Chris Manuel \u2013 Wells Fargo","Good morning, gentlemen. I promise I don\u2019t have an MLP question for you. Anyway, I did want to go back to DeRidder for a second and the D3 start-up and some of the elements there. Could you maybe walk us through what a typical experience might be bringing one of these machines on stream? I think you mentioned the first month or so, it really doesn\u2019t produce a lot of paper. Is this typically a six-month process until you get to the roughly 90,000 tons a quarter run rate? Is there a typical phasing that these go through?","Mark Kowlzan","Well, let me just again put a little color on this. Three weeks ago, the paper machine down at DeRidder was nothing more than just framework. I\u2019m talking about just press section framework, forming section framework, the driers \u2013 there wasn\u2019t much left in the drier section and the winder was completely gone. So in three weeks\u2019 time, that was all reassembled and started up last Thursday, so we\u2019re pleased with what we\u2019ve seen. We\u2019re obviously on a curve. We\u2019re making good quality\u2014well, we\u2019re making medium at the time. We also have to qualify our linerboard product on the machine as time goes on. So we really are not going to speculate in terms of its capabilities and the timing of that. There is a lot of uncertainty in terms of what could go wrong; on the other hand, we have tried to and we believe we have engineered in best practices and have the right people managing the business.","So again, our plans for the quarter would produce roughly 50,000 tons for the market to demand, to supply our system, but other than that we\u2019re just going to take it day by day.","Chris Manuel \u2013 Wells Fargo","That\u2019s helpful. One more follow-up question, if I could there. How do you\u2014how difficult is it to flip back and forth between linerboard medium that you make there? Is it a complicated process? How do you think about that balance within your system?","Mark Kowlzan","It\u2019s complicated. It involves the chemistry on the wet end of the machine, so it\u2019s not just a simple matter of turning a switch. You have to consider the various chemical additives that are used to produce medium characteristics as opposed to linerboard, so there is a period of hours, say, that are involved and then getting the machine started back up and lined back up on the various grades.","So there is a degree of difficulty there, and again we have to learn how to do that and go through that experience.","Chris Manuel \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thank you. Just two other quick ones. Rick, one of your favorite questions about 2015 that I know you love to answer \u2013 could you give us maybe a sense as to early thoughts about capital spending? I mean, obviously this year was a big year as you went through this conversion at D3. I\u2019m anticipating \u201915 probably comes down. Is something in that 3 to 350 range something that\u2019s probably reasonable, or how should we kind of think about \u201915 at this point for capital?","Richard West","Well, we\u2019ve already stated that we were going to drop our capital from 2014 to 2015, and we said we were going to be in around 400, 410 for this year. So I think first thing you should do is back off the D3, which was about 100, 110 for this year \u2013 that gets you down to 300, and then you don\u2019t have (indiscernible). So just without a lot of strategic projects, you\u2019re below 300, and we\u2019ve said we plan to be below 300 \u2013 you know, in the high 200\u2019s range somewhere \u2013 and we\u2019ll give more clarification on that in January. But unless there\u2019s major strategic projects that come up that Mark talked about with very high returns, we would plan to bring our capital below 300 next year.","Mark Kowlzan","Yeah, and just the qualifier on that \u2013 you know, with the acquisition of Boise, there\u2019s obviously more opportunities to deploy capex into high return projects, and if you\u2019re willing to reduce your hurdle rate, you still could have a lot of pretty good projects that you could spend capital on. We haven\u2019t done that \u2013 we\u2019re keeping our hurdle rates where they were, and that means that there\u2019s some projects that even though they have attractive returns, we\u2019re not going to compensate on hurdle rate. So that will limit more than anything else how much capital we spend.","Now, if we find some big project that meets the kind of hurdle rates we\u2019ve historically wanted, then we would increase that number; but we\u2019re not going to break our discipline just because we have opportunities for some pretty good projects if they\u2019re below the hurdle rate.","Chris Manuel \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Just a last quick question is as we see some of the efforts in China now to step up collection of OCC, that\u2019s put a little bit of pressure here on OCC domestically. How do you view the balance between some of the more virgin grades that you\u2019re making and some of the recovered grades? Is that something that\u2014how do you process that, how do you think about that? Is that something that you\u2019re worried about?","Mark Kowlzan","Just the opposite. We think long-term, the world is going to run out of recycled fiber because virtually all the capacity added in the world for the last 10 years has been recycled. Had the recession not happened in the fourth quarter of 2008, there\u2019s the chance that we\u2019d have run out of recycled fiber then, the line we\u2019re about to cross.","So in the short term, unless China gets going, recycled fiber we think will probably stay where it is; but if economic activity begins to improve in China, there\u2019s going to be pressure on OCC again in our opinion, and we\u2019re glad we\u2019re primarily a virgin operation.","Chris Manuel \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thank you, good luck.","Operator","The next question comes from Scott Gaffner with Barclays.","Scott Gaffner \u2013 Barclays","Good morning. My question\u2019s really around the demand that you\u2019re seeing so far in 4Q. Are you seeing anything that looks more like September, or is it looking more like the rest of the quarter where things were maybe a little bit slower for the industry?","Mark Kowlzan","I would say that our demand\u2014as I mentioned, we\u2019ve only got a few days to really look at, about 11 days, and it\u2019s been pretty solid starting in October. We will of course trend down some by the end of the year, which is pretty much the norm for us, but right now the quarter is pretty solid from a demand standpoint.","Scott Gaffner \u2013 Barclays","Okay. Any thoughts around sort of the increase in ecommerce as we move into the fourth quarter? I think you guys mentioned it the last couple of years, but is it something that you\u2019re looking at as something that could improve demand in the fourth quarter again this year?","Mark Kowlzan","I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt about that. You just look at the numbers \u2013 that arena is growing very, very fast, and of course you know that\u2019s heavy corrugated use. So again, we experienced an increase last year and I think some of that is going to occur in the fourth quarter this year as well.","Scott Gaffner \u2013 Barclays","Okay. When you look at your inventory levels, you seem to think that everything was\u2014you know, you were comfortable with your inventory levels. Is there any reason you would need to take those higher, meaning if that freight cost built on rail and truck hadn\u2019t abated, is there any concern that maybe that gets a little bit tighter again in the fourth quarter and you might need to take your inventory levels up to account for that? ","Tom Hassfurther","You know, as we talked about on the second quarter and we reiterated today, we\u2019d intentionally moved that inventory up because of the transportation issues and with the fact that going into 2015 1Q we have the Counce mill down and the big D1 DeRidder machine down. So our intention is to build some inventory and take advantage of that, and again not seeing a significant improvement in transportation issues.","Scott Gaffner \u2013 Barclays","Okay. Just lastly, I think I might have heard you say that you had positive mix in your corrugated business in the third quarter. If I heard that right, what was driving the positive mix shift?","Tom Hassfurther","The positive mix is primarily the graphics-related business that relates to the Christmas season and even going into next year\u2019s season, depending on when those customers begin to develop those products.","Scott Gaffner \u2013 Barclays","So more just a positive seasonal mix shift, nothing out of the ordinary?","Tom Hassfurther","That\u2019s correct.","Scott Gaffner \u2013 Barclays","Perfect, thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Al Kabili with Macquarie.","Al Kabili \u2013 Macquarie","Thanks, good morning. I wanted to circle up on DeRidder and clarify if in your adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter, if that included any headwind from some of the start-up costs, as you indicated.","Mark Kowlzan","No.","Al Kabili \u2013 Macquarie","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then secondly, Rick, on the capex on the high 200\u2019s, would that include box plant, necessary sort of box plant investment, because I know sometimes that can change depending on whether you acquire or invest organically in box plants. Just a clarification on that capex, factoring in the box plant, necessary box plant expansion. ","Richard West","Yes, other than some of the things that we have periodically done strategically in the box plants to put in major pieces of equipment all at one time, that number does include environmental, maintenance, some cost reduction in the mills as well as growth in the box plant. So it\u2019s the normalized base that we\u2019ve always had, just including now the white papers business and the packaging business of Boise now that we have some of the major strategics ahead of us\u2014behind us, excuse me.","Al Kabili \u2013 Macquarie","Okay, thank you very much. Then on the inflation front, last question is just what are you seeing on wood costs, and any view over the next year as perhaps pellet demand continues to increase? And conversely, any thoughts on if oil prices stay here, what that might mean to you from a savings perspective across transportation, other kind of oil type derivative costs that you might have.","Mark Kowlzan","I think on the wood cost question, the only issue we\u2019ve seen this year was the summer rains that occurred in the upper midwest that affected the Wisconsin area for us and also the Minnesota region. But that\u2019s stabilized, so the rest of the North American wood cost system has been pretty flat. ","As far as pellets, we continue to hear of some additional pellet plant activity in the southern region. That has\u2014currently, it hasn\u2019t been a significant impact this year. As far as oil, obviously lower oil would portend to indicate a lower diesel price, but we haven\u2019t seen that yet. That\u2019s a potential opportunity you\u2019d have to anticipate. Other than that, I really don\u2019t have anything.","Al Kabili \u2013 Macquarie","All right, I appreciate that, and good luck. Thank you.","Mark Kowlzan","All right. Operator, I think we\u2019ve got time for one more question and then we\u2019ll wrap it up. I think it\u2019s after 10:00 our time.","Operator","The final question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with DA Davidson.","Steve Chercover \u2013 DA Davidson ","","Good morning, thanks for fitting me in. A lot of things have been covered, but it seems like packaged food has really hit a rough patch recently. Do you believe there\u2019s been a permanent shift in consumer behavior?","Mark Kowlzan","Can you repeat the question again, Steve, real quick?","Steve Chercover \u2013 DA Davidson","Sure. It just seems like packaged food has hit a rough patch, according to some of the retailers. I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s a permanent shift in consumer behavior, and if so, would a shift to local food offset that?","Mark Kowlzan","I don\u2019t really have an answer for you on that. I\u2019m not aware of this most recent study. I can tell you that obviously food is a big part of the demand in corrugated, and it\u2019s just moved up modestly this year. The beverage sector has been kind of flat as well. But to my point earlier regarding consumers having more money in their pockets, we would expect those areas to move up going forward as consumers have a little more money to spend.","Steve Chercover \u2013 DA Davidson","Agreed. Is it safe to say that your $1.16 guidance for the fourth quarter is incorporating flat pricing?","Mark Kowlzan","We don\u2019t give price guidance in advance. We don\u2019t do that. We only talk about historic prices, not forward-looking on pricing for legal reasons.","Steve Chercover \u2013 DA Davidson","Got it. Okay, thank you very much.","Mark Kowlzan","Okay, with that, Operator, I\u2019d like to thank everybody for participating on the call today and look forward to seeing everybody and talking to everybody in January for the fourth quarter and full-year call. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. This will conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect your lines."],"16844":["Packaging of America (NYSE:PKG) Q4 2011 Earnings Call January 24, 2012 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Thomas A.

Your host for today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chief Executive Officer of PCA. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference call over to Mr. Kowlzan. Please go ahead when you are ready.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Good morning, and welcome to Packaging Corporation of America's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call. I'm Mark Kowlzan, CEO of PCA, and with me on the call today is Paul Stecko, Executive Chairman of PCA; Tom Hassfurther, who runs our Corrugated business; and Rick West, PCA's Chief Financial Officer. Thanks for participating in this morning's call, and after the presentation, we'll be glad to take any questions. ","Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter 2011 net income of $39 million or $0.40 per share. Reported results for the fourth quarter of 2010 were $53 million or $0.52 per share, excluding income from biofuel tax credits and asset disposal charges. The reduction in earnings per share compared to last year's fourth quarter were driven by cost inflation, $0.10, lower containerboard export prices, $0.03, increased depreciation, $0.02 and higher taxes and interest expense, $0.02. These items were partially offset by lower energy and chemical usage, $0.03, related to the energy project and higher corrugated products volume of $0.03. Excluding special items, full year earnings were $162 million or $1.61 per share compared to 2010 earnings of $166 million or $1.62 per share. Price and mix, $0.38, higher volume $0.17, and cost reduction benefits, $0.06 improved earnings, but was offset by cost inflation of $0.56 and higher depreciation expense of $0.05. ","Net sales in the fourth quarter were $654 million, up 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 net sales of $627 million and full-year net sales were a record $2.6 billion, up 8% over 2010. Regarding operations, we had an exceptional quarter with record mill production and corrugated product shipments. In addition, we also accomplished several strategic objectives. We completed the major energy projects at our Counce, Tennessee and Valdosta, Georgia linerboard mills as scheduled and on budget, started up a new corrugated products plant in Reading, Pennsylvania and acquired a box plant in Denver, Colorado. Looking at the specific details of operations, our corrugated demand was very strong throughout the quarter, with shipments per workday up 9% over last year and total shipments up 7.2% with 1 less workday. The 9% per workday improvement and 7.2% increase in total shipments included 2.3% from 2011 box plant acquisitions. Excluding these acquisitions, we still had record shipments. The increased corrugated products volume improved earnings about $0.03 per share compared to last year's fourth quarter. Outside sales containerboard also remained strong equaling last year's fourth quarter. Our mills produced 640,000 tons, up 2,000 tons from last year. All 4 of the mills ran extremely well, especially our Counce and Valdosta mills, considering the start-up of the new recovery boiler and turbine at Valdosta and also the #2 recovery after the rebuild at Counce. ","We ended the quarter with our containerboard inventory down about 11,000 tons below 2010 year end levels, and on plan to support our containerboard needs during our annual maintenance outages at both Valdosta and Counce in the first quarter. Valdosta will be down for about a week in February for their outage and at Counce, one machine will be down for 4 days in March, with the shutdown continuing into April. Moving to price, our domestic pricing for containerboard remained essentially unchanged from last year's fourth quarter and this year's third quarter. But pricing for export linerboard did fall during the fourth quarter with reduced earnings by about $0.03 per share. As stated earlier, higher input costs and other inflationary cost pressures reduced our earnings by about $0.10 per share compared to last year's fourth quarter. But on a positive note, the rate of inflation was less than in previous quarters. Higher outbound transportation costs reduced our earnings by about $0.03 per share, labor-related costs, including fringes, by about $0.025 per share, chemical cost increases, $0.015 per share, energy cost increases, $0.01 per share, and other cost increase items by $0.02 per share. Published prices for recycled fiber or old corrugated containers, excluding the delivery costs, were down about $15 per ton compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. The lower recycled fiber costs improved our earnings by only about $0.01 per share with our low usage but was essentially offset by lower recycled fiber sales prices out of our box plants. ","I'm now going to turn it over to Richard West, our CFO, who will give you an update on financial matters.","Richard B. West","In the fourth quarter, PCA generated cash from operations of $109 million, our uses of cash included total capital expenditures of $65 million, $18 million for the Counce and Valdosta energy projects, $13 million for strategic projects at our box plants and $34 million for normal capital expenditures. For the year, cash generated from operations was $346 million, total capital expenditures were $280 million, including $120 million for our major energy projects, $35 million for strategic box plant projects, and $125 million for normal capital expenditures. ","During the quarter, we also repurchased 1,271,000 shares of our common stock for about $25 per share or $32 million, and paid our regular common stock dividend that amounted to approximately $20 million. For the year, we paid common stock dividends of $76 million and repurchased 4,824,000 shares of our common stock at $25.50 per share or $123 million. ","As of December 31, 2011, our diluted shares outstanding were 97.6 million shares. On November 30, 2011, we acquired with cash, Colorado container, a corrugated products manufacturer in the Denver, Colorado area with annual sales of $27 million in 2010. We ended the year with $156 million cash on hand and total debt of $808 million. During the fourth quarter, we used $8 million of our available biofuel tax credits to offset cash taxes; and as of year end, we had estimated tax credits between $65 million and $167 million, with the final amount to be determined based upon the current IRS review of our amended 2009 tax return which was filed in December 2010. ","We also applied for a Department of the Treasury Energy Reinvestment grant of $57 million last Thursday. If approved, we should expect to receive the funds in the second quarter. In terms of 2012 guidance for taxes, we expect our effective combined federal and state tax rate for income reporting purposes to average 36% for the year, and our cash tax rate to average about 21%. The difference driven by fuel tax credits and other tax deductions. Depreciation expense for 2012 is expected to be $170 million, up $6 million from 2011. A preliminary estimate of pretax pension expense and funding for 2012 is $39 million and $32 million, respectively. With pretax pension expense up $10 million over 2011 and funding up $10 million, driven by both expected lower discount rates and asset rates of return. With that, I will turn it back over to Mark.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Thank you, Rick. Before I move to the first quarter outlook, to sum up 2011, we knew it would be a difficult and challenging year. Our entire organization responded well to those challenges. At our mills, we set an all-time production record despite having about 40,000 tons of project-related downtime and machine slowbacks during the year. And we completed our energy project on schedule at our original estimated project capital of $295 million. ","In corrugated products, we set an all-time record for corrugated product shipments, plus we acquired 3 box plants, started up a new box plant and completed major equipment installations and start-ups at 3 other box plants. Despite significant inflationary cost pressures, our earnings of $1.61 per share were only $0.01 per share lower than our all-time record results set last year. Entering 2012, we are well positioned to benefit from the strategic efforts we completed in 2011, both in terms of earnings and reduced capital expenditures. From a cash standpoint, capital expenditures for 2012 are expected to be about $110 million, down $170 million from 2011. We plan to continue to make strategic box plant acquisitions and also return excess cash to our shareholders through both common stock dividends and share repurchases. ","Moving to the first quarter outlook, corrugated product shipments should be higher with 4 additional workdays compared to the fourth quarter, and we also expect a full quarter's earnings benefit from our major energy projects. We expect normal first quarter cost increases from colder weather, annual maintenance outages at our Counce and Valdosta mills, timing-related employee benefits, a higher tax rate and pension expense. Average export container board prices are expected to be lower, reflecting the full impact of the fourth quarter price changes. Considering all of these items, we currently estimate our first-quarter earnings at about $0.40 per share. ","With that, we'll be happy to entertain any questions but I must remind you that some of the statements we made on this call constitute forward-looking statements. The statements are based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company, and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. With that operator, I'd like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research.","Mark A. Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you. Just one question on the energy projects. It sounds like they've gotten off to a very good start. So does that mean that in the first quarter, we will see all of the benefits kind of on a run-rate basis showing up? Or would there be potentially be incremental benefits as the year progresses?","Mark W. Kowlzan","As the year winds on, we'll see the continued benefits accumulate. The projects are complete and everything is running as we expected. So from that point of view, the first quarter benefits that we would expect, will be there. But again as the second and third quarter are compiled, we'll see the biggest benefits from the project through the summer months into the early fall. Those being our best months in terms of the shutdowns are behind us, all 4 mills are running. But in respect to Counce and Valdosta, theoretically they'd be in their most optimum run position.","Mark A. Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. So operationally everything is in place and it's just because second and third quarter, you've got more volume and so there is more benefit?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Yes.","Paul T. Stecko","Mark, this is Paul. What I said on the last call, when we got through everything, we gave what we thought the benefit would be, but it's not linear. I think when you net-netted everything, between the project and the increased and lack of shutdown, we got to about a $0.26 number, but it's not linear because it follows volume. The more you make, the bigger the benefit because you need more energy to make it, you need more chemicals and that's what -- and more electricity, and that is what the projects saves. And so our biggest production quarters has historically been the second and third quarter, you'll get a bigger benefit from the project there than the first quarter. But we're up and running, we expect the full first quarter's benefit because we've come up so well, and -- but as I said and Mark said,  the benefits are not linear. They are a function of the total production that's made in that quarter.","Mark A. Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Got it. And one other, the share repurchase authorization, obviously, you're generating lots of cash. Where are you in terms of how much you have left on that, repurchase authorization?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Mark, we have $1 million left from our prior authorization, plus the full 150 from our current authorization. So in total we have $150 million -- $151 million of share repurchase authorization remaining.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari from Citi.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","You referenced weaker export markets throughout the quarter. Can you talk about what you're seeing in January, whether you're seeing any kind of stabilization there? And then with domestic demand, how has the market shaped up so far?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Tom, go ahead and why don't you shed some light on that.","Thomas A. Hassfurther","Okay, Anthony, let me first mention export. I think, both in demand and pricing it's pretty much bottomed out. Now of course, currency has a lot to play in that role so we'll just have to see what happens. And on the domestic side, I mean, things are relatively stable. And it's, you see the numbers that's happening in the industry. And our domestic customers have fared quite well with the economy moving forward although at a slower pace than we'd like.","Mark W. Kowlzan","The only thing Anthony, that I would add to that, Paul mentioned currency, and that's very important. But it's most important in Europe where the euro is, as you know, because of the banking crisis over there, the debt crisis, their currency has really come down against the dollar. Rest of the world currency is not as big a concern as Europe. But the euro has gone from roughly 145 at a high to 125, that's a huge swing. And that affects the price realization. So that's the most important market in the world, currency-wise.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And can you remind us roughly how much of your exports are going to Europe? Or are euro-based?","Mark W. Kowlzan","What we've said basically, historically, 1\/3 of our -- we have 3 big markets in the world. Europe, South America and China, and it'll vary year-to-year. But 1\/3, 1\/3, 1\/3, and that can vary up or down, but that's the order of magnitude description of our export business.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Thank you, and with the Reading facility on line and your recent acquisitions, can you estimate roughly what your current box plant integration level is? And if 90% is still the target, what is the bridge that kind of gets you from here to there looking at expansions versus acquisitions versus outperforming the industry?","Mark W. Kowlzan","With the current status, with the success of the energy projects and the mill's performance, we're still at the 80% level of integration even with the 3 acquisitions and the Reading plant. So the goal is still 90, and so that's the goal. But we're still down at that lower 80% area on integration.","Paul T. Stecko","But we didn't get of course, the full benefit of the acquisitions, nor the Reading plant in 2011 which will help us going into 2012.","Mark W. Kowlzan","If you think about 2011, of the gains that were made on the corrugated products out of the business, a little more than 1% for the full year was contributed from the acquisitions. So about 1% out of the 5% improvement for the year.","Mark W. Kowlzan","It's Tom Hassfurther's job and it's his job to increase the integration level by selling more boxes. It's getting increasingly difficult because our mills continue to be more and more productive. And so doesn't -- not only does he have to gain, he has to also offset the increased production of a couple of percent a year that we usually get out of our mills. We've got his treadmill on about a 45-degree angle but he's hanging in there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chip Dillon from Vertical Research Partners.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","One thing that I noticed that -- seems quite impressive and just wanted some color on this is, if you look at your corrugated shipments in the fourth quarter this year, just looking at the percentages over the 4 years, it's about 10% above what it was in the fourth quarter of '07 when we started to really step into the great recession. And I noticed, that most likely depending on what they report for December that we're probably down 7% over the same period for the industry. So that's quite a phenomenal difference that you guys have generated. And I was just wondering simply, is this only because your customers are growing faster than the more national account-oriented customers at your competition or is there something more going on here? Do you feel you might be actually taking some customers from other people and that might account for it as well?","Mark W. Kowlzan","If you look at the last 10 years, you will see the trend that has built that performance. And then also as we've spoken for the last 2 years, the strategic activity in the box plants with the -- where we identified about a half dozen of our key box plants that could utilize capacity enhancements. We've concluded all but one of the box plants. So last year, we completed 3 of those strategic upgrades along with the Reading plant. So we've enhanced, over the last 2 years, 5 out of our 6 box plants to take advantage of demand that was there that we could never fulfill. And with that, Tom why don't you shed some light on some of the details across the board, because I think we've got -- again this is a nationwide volume.","Thomas A. Hassfurther","Well, Chip, I would just add that when our sales approach is really a -- really requires a long sales cycle because we're out selling value as opposed to price. And it takes quite a while to get those accounts and prospects online. And we've been very fortunate that many of those opportunities have come together. And of course as I mentioned before, we've spent a lot of time selecting our customer base and who we're going after so that we can grow with them over the long haul. And yes, in fact, they did weather the recession and the downturn, better than some of their competitors. And as a result of that, we've been able to take advantage of some of the opportunities that they've allowed us with regard to growth. And of course they've grown their export markets and they've grown their domestic markets. And as Mark mentioned, we have spent our capital and strategic investments including the Reading plant in areas where we were literally out of capacity and we needed to add capacity to be able to take advantage of that. And of course -- and then finally, of course this year and going into 2012, the addition of the acquisitions will give us a 2% to 3% bump and we're -- and they've quite frankly exceeded our expectations. So I think as long as we continue down this path of hard work, we're well positioned for the future.","Paul T. Stecko","And this is Paul. Just to amplify, give you some numbers on the comment Mark made. What you cite is true since 2007 and those numbers we're obviously pleased with. But this has been a decade-long phenomenon. If you go back 10 years, the beginning of the decade to the end of the decade, basically our volume, these are rough numbers, are up 30% and the industry was flat over that same time period. So this is not a recent phenomenon, this has continued for long time and I think it's a testament to what Tom just said, our business model is finding customers who appreciate value and who we think will grow, and then we work very hard to give them value which, in the end is, more important than anything.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Got you. Also one could say it even might have accelerated some in recent years versus the progress you had early on. So congrats on that. And then just, I would ask secondly, as we look at 2012 and you look at the various cost items, it would seem like obviously you're not buying really that much natural gas any more which is going to help people. But what about wood costs? Are you seeing a continued sort of edging down of wood cost especially in the south or are there other factors that might cause that to reverse or head back up?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Wood cost has been flat. And I think again everything you read supports that. But 2011 was from a weather point of view, was pretty tame, so as we finished up the year, wood stayed in a relatively close trading range. And with regard to natural gas, we have taken advantage of some below spot prices over the last couple of months now. And one example of that was at Counce mill, during the Christmas holidays, we had a boiler outage on the big power boiler. And we were able to burn that natural gas in the newly rebuilt recovery boilers and take advantage of that. But again, we do have that flexibility, just to remind everybody, in many of our locations.","Paul T. Stecko","And Chip, just to amplify a point Mark brought up, a very important point about our energy project. We've given guidance on how much it should contribute to EPS over the year. And that comes in the category of cost savings, that the project is saving us money. But there's another category and we had a really -- Mark just brought up a very good example of it, called cost avoidance. Now cost avoidance doesn't contribute to EPS but it prevents it from going down. And we had a tube failure in a power boiler in December and we had planned to replace some panels during the annual shutdown and unfortunately we didn't make it all the way, we missed by a couple of months. And when it's our biggest power boiler, burns wood waste and when we lost it, normally in the old days, we would have to run the mill at half capacity. One machine. And we needed tons, but with the rebuilt, the recovery boilers, their steam generation capacity is a lot higher. We actually put load burners in that recovery boiler and we burned liquor and natural gas at the same time. And instead of losing 1,500 tons a day of production, we only lost 300 tons a day of production. And so that roughly 7,000, 8,000 tons of production that we made probably prevent -- if we figure out what it's worth, it probably prevented earnings from going down $0.03 a share. It didn't improve them, but that's the other big benefit of this new project. We have a lot of flexibility now that when you get into upset conditions or maintenance outages, you're much better able to cope and offset cost that otherwise we could not have done in the past. So we were very surprised how well we could run that mill without that big power boiler.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Wilde from Deutsche Bank.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Mark, I'm just curious with these energy projects finished now. Does that debottleneck these mills at all and really give you the opportunity over the next few years to look at actually increasing capacity at either Counce or Valdosta?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Yes, and a good example of that, Mark, as the projects were coming to completion through the fall, in parallel, we had been performing other capital work projects in the pulp mill, caustic plant at both Valdosta and Counce. And when the boilers were completed, we were able to take advantage of a new level of optimization in the pulp mill and caustic plant areas that give us more pulping capabilities. And so the paper machines are able to take advantage of that. So I think to answer your question, yes, we are in a position now to take the mills to a whole different level of optimization. And continue to creep that capacity with minimal expenditures.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Mark, can you give us any sense of sort of what a timeline might look like on that or what the incremental volume might be over the next few years?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Well again if you look at 2011, we produced 2.5 million tons in a year that we actually had about 40,000 tons of extra planned outage capacity out. So we did have productivity improvements during the year from the energy projects and the efforts. But based on current machine production capabilities, if you think about it, the capacity is probably 2.575 million tons or up about 3% from the 2011 production. And if you think about where we go from there, 2% to 3% productivity improvements per year is not to be -- that would be expected from the activity we have.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's very encouraging. Second question I had. On the export side of the equation, can you just ballpark for us how much of your open market sales go into the export market? And then also give us a sense of whether export pricing kind of is varying by those different markets you talked about. Because I was always under the impression that, that heavyweight product you sold into places like Latin America might be a little more stable versus some other export markets?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Yes. I think, traditionally, if you look at our volume, about 20% of what we produce in the mills goes to outside sales. And of that 20%, historically, about half, 10%, is going offshore and 10% is staying domestic. That number has been pretty consistent. On the second part of your question, I think you are -- with the issues in Europe, we saw bigger declines of pricing in Europe. But some of the regions such as South America and Central America, prices have been more stable relative to that.","Paul T. Stecko","Yes. But Mark, I would say that, that's not correct, that you're assumption is not correct. Our demand in Europe and South America, I would say, the stability has been the same historically because we're not really spot players. We've had long-term customers, long-term relations in both Europe and South America. Wood cost is the volatility now, and in Europe it's this huge swing in currency. And I would have said that without the currency swing, Europe is just as stable for us as South America. And the market that was the more volatile of the 3 was the Far East.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And that's both from a volume and from a pricing side?","Paul T. Stecko","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Connelly from CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Mark, I'm just wondering if you could help us -- remind us what your strategic view of integration levels really is. Your capacity is growing, you're struggling to keep up there, but you are going out and picking up new box plants on the outside. You've always talked about sales into the independent market being a strategically important piece. Can you give us a sense of what those targets are as you think about buying new box plants?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Well, the target remains 90%. And as we've spoken at different times over the last 2 years, part of the effort to get to the 90% included at least one acquisition a year. So it's interesting that Tom was able to accomplish 3 acquisitions last year, plus the start-up of the new Reading plant. So we added 4 new box plants last year. And still, with the dramatic improvement seen at the mills, we held at that lower 80% integration. But still, to answer your question, the target remains 90%. We're going to continue as we are right now, looking at opportunities for acquisitions and continuing to enhance the existing box plant capabilities.","Paul T. Stecko","And Mark, this is Paul. There's nothing magic about 90%. We kind of picked that number because it's higher than 80% and it's less than 100%. But there's a reason for that. As you know, we make money at both our box plants and our mills. So every time that we sell into the outside market, does not avail us the opportunity to make money in the box plant on those tons. So we don't like to lose that piece of the profit. So you can then say, well, why not go to 100%? And the reason for that is, as Tom has further pointed out, we're outselling value to our box customers, and there's a lot of things that constitute value from performance of the product to service, but also on dependability of supply, both when things are good and bad. So we would never get to 100% because our customers know that we offer them supply assurance, and that 10% buffer is sufficient to be able to always make that statement that we can supply all of our domestic box customers. And that's why it's 90%. Now if it ends up 88% or 92%, there's really not that much difference.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","So presumably, you don't have a specific export target because you think of it in terms of every individual piece of business and whether it makes any money?","Paul T. Stecko","That's right. That's exactly right. We're very customer-centric.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Staphos from Bank of America Securities.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just want to continue on that last sort of line of questioning. As you look at the strategy over the last 10-plus years, it's clearly been successful, at least looking at your returns. And you continue to have the opportunity to grow your mill production, apparently at very high margins. How long do you think you can continue with the existing strategy, Paul or Mark, in a containerboard market that overall remains flat? What hope do you have? What signs do you see that perhaps kind of domestic manufacturing will be rebounding in the next few years such that the containerboard market overall, which has been flat over the last 10-plus years, actually sees some growth in the upcoming years, which would help you in turn grow even more profitably?","Mark W. Kowlzan","The first part of your question, we believe that our strategy can continue on where we're looking at opportunities within the box plants that are available to us. We continue to believe that we can make good acquisitions as we go forward. And along with that, support those acquisitions with volume improvements within the mills. And we think that the market, as far as whether it's -- you're saying flat, we don't think it's flat. We think there is improvement in the North American footprint. So we're encouraged, and we think we can continue on with this trajectory.","Paul T. Stecko","Back on that point about growth, it has been flat for a decade. But we think with what's happening in the world, some of the perils of doing business in China and Mexico is forcing some business back to the U.S. I think if the U.S. is to solve its deficit problem, there will be some recapitalization of American enterprise involved. And we think the fundamentals for corrugated growth as we enter the new decade appear a lot better than entering the previous decade once we get through the volatility of the financial situation in Europe and the deficit. But our prognosis is long-term. This next 10 years is going to be a lot better than the previous 10 years. And now of course, you can say anything's better than 0, and you'd be right. But we are optimistic about the future.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Paul, I know it's hard to project this sort of thing, but if we think about the next 2 to 3 years, on the one hand, for now anyway, it sounds like you have completed most of the strategic investments that you had expected to do within your box system. On the other hand, you may have a domestic market that's recovering. Do you anticipate the use of cash being more or less balanced as it has been in prior years? Or do you think you have the opportunity to do more buyback since the strategic investment cycle maybe is decelerating for you?","Paul T. Stecko","Well, this is Paul, let me take that question. Mark and Tom Hassfurther, their primary job is to generate as much cash as possible. And I let them do that for the last couple of years and they're doing well. Me and Rick, we look at how we're going to use that cash. So not that they're not involved, but they got to make it, and we got to figure the best use of it. And we had a terrific year cash-wise as far as I'm concerned. We purchased almost 5 million shares of stock, and it gets us down to 97 million and change in the number of shares. We've paid out almost $80 million in dividends, and we've made 3 very good acquisitions. And what we've said is that once we feel more certainty about the long-term prospect for earnings, the projects are online, we'll see what happens with this debt crisis in Europe and how it might or might not affect the economy in the U.S. and where's the next move on pricing in this industry, has it stayed the same, is it up, it's down. The next thing we got to take a hard look at, and we're already taking a hard look at, is where we move the dividend. And that's something that we will evaluate on a continuing basis because as we said last year, we see both share buyback and dividends as the 2 primary vehicles to return value to shareholders. And we still think that while we're adding box plants, the capital required for box plants is modest compared to these megaprojects in the mills. And the good news is we're done with the big CapEx in the mills. This energy project, as Mark said, puts us at a new status, and his conversation with a previous questioner, it gives us some flexibility in the mill in terms of productivity improvement. So we're really down to 3 things. Share buyback, which we've done a lot of. Dividends, which we raised once since the recession, and that's something we're going to look at. But there's the 3 primary vehicles for cash usage.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Paul just last one. Early January trends, if you can comment on that, that'd be great.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Yes. If you look at the first 12 days of the box plant cut of activity, on a bookings and billings point of view, we're up a strong 10% on both bookings and billings for the first 12 days. So things are looking very good for January and trending along with the same pace that we ended the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just want to follow on George's question about return of cash to shareholders. Would you say at this point you guys are at an optimal leverage? Or would you consider raising the leverage to return more cash to shareholders? Or would it have to be, perhaps, for some other kind of opportunity? How are you thinking about that?","Paul T. Stecko","Well, I think most people -- we think we're leveraged about right. And of course, we've said that for the last 5 years. And I would say, a lot of the people that follow us probably would say we're under leveraged, that we could take on more leverage. But we do have a conservative bias to us. So we don't see our leverage changing very much. And so that's one thing I didn't mention, that we had no plans to take on debt or pay down debt. We're kind of happy with where we are, which means that the decision with regard to box plant acquisitions against small capital, debit increase and share buyback won't be affected by our leverage. They will be more affected by external factors in terms of how much cash we think we can generate going forward. But the debt doesn't play virtually any role at all on those decisions.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then just the second question is, could you share with us your maintenance downtime plans, kind of by quarter for this year?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Well, we only give one quarter at a time. But if you look at the first quarter, we're taking Valdosta down for about a week. And then one of the machines at Counce, the #2 machine, will be down in the second quarter. But the first machine will be down, #1 machine at Counce, for approximately 5 days. But the tonnage impact for Valdosta and Counce for the first quarter is a little over 17,000 tons. So it's a little lighter than normal first quarter because we had shifted part of the Counce effort into the second quarter. But that's the impact. A little over 17,000 tons of planned outage for the first quarter.","Paul T. Stecko","Yes. And when we talked to you on the last call, we had planned to take the full Counce downtime in the first quarter, as is our normal practice. But when we had that power boiler tube failure in December, we had had a plan to continually to replace panels in that boiler. But when we had a tube failure, we decided to pool up next year's replacement into this year and not take any chances. And so we had to get a few more extra panels, and we couldn't get them delivered until the beginning of April. And so we simply then extended that shutdown, half in March or so and half in April. And that's why it got pushed to the second quarter, to best maximize the use of downtime with regard to that boiler. And so that's why it's a little different this year. There'll be a touch more downtime in the second quarter than normal and a touch less in the first quarter than normal.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then Just one last question. I think you said in the fourth quarter the year-over-year impact of labor and benefits was about $0.025. So if I annualize that, that'd be about $0.10 annually. Is it fair to say that's kind of the right run rate this year, and then you have pension on top of that in terms of the incremental $10 million expense that you talked about? Is that the right way to think about that?","Mark W. Kowlzan","That is combined. It includes both labor and fringes, and we would expect essentially the same thing going into 2012. However, you never know what's going to happen to medical. That's the real one that could be anywhere, an increase from -- it can run anywhere, increasing from 10% to 20% in a given year. So that's just -- that's the open. But in general, I would expect it to be about the same going into '12.","Operator","Our next question comes from Al Kabili from Credit Suisse.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just wanted to talk a little bit on the box plants. And you mentioned you were able to do kind of an above trend, 3 acquisitions this year. What are you seeing out there? Is the pipeline and what you're looking at indicative that you can continue to go above trend this year? Well, understanding it's hard to predict? And the follow on to that is at the current stock price, do you have sort of a preference in terms of share buybacks versus acquisitions incrementally, which way you want to lean towards?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Well, let me answer the first question regarding acquisitions and that predictability going forward. I can tell you, it's not predictable. These things, when they present themselves, you have to be prepared to be able to take advantage of it. And some of them we even try to create on our own to some extent. But we're very disciplined in terms of what we want from an acquisition. We obviously want very talented people. We want a great customer base, and we want to have them immediately accretive to earnings. So it's a pretty high standard for what we set regarding acquisitions. And if enough present themselves and it's the right opportunity, we take advantage of it. So it's very difficult to predict.","Paul T. Stecko","And the second part of your question, the amount of capital in the box plants really is not -- we figure, $40 million a year, we'd be happy if we could get that much done on box plant acquisitions. And we did a little better than that this year. But that's normally -- you find 1 in a year, or 2. Good ones, they're hard to find because of all of the reasons that Tom talked about. But that does not really affect the biggest piece of the cash, which has been going to share buyback and dividends. And in terms -- both share buyback and dividends have advantages. And our share count's now down from 104.5 million shares to 97 million in change. That has a nice effect on EPS. It gives us more leverage, if you've got faith in the business going forward. The fewer the shares, the more leverage. And we like that at dividends. And if you feel that your stock is undervalued, then it's a good deal for shareholders. And so that all plays a part in it. Dividends, on the other hand, shareholders like dividends. Successful companies pay dividends. And even though our return is one of the higher in our industries right now, I would argue that a higher return is good for shareholders. And so it's a balance, and the answer changes at different times. It depends where your shares are valued, et cetera. But the dividend is important to shareholders, and we recognize that.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And I was trying to get a sense of which way you're leaning towards right at this moment. If you have a view.","Paul T. Stecko","When we have a view on that, we'll make an announcement. That's not something we normally discuss at an earnings call.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then I wanted to also follow up and clarify the energy project. Are you still looking at an incremental $0.21 for 2012, if I have that right?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Yes. What we said at the end of the -- at our third quarter earnings release conference call, we said we would have about $0.21 per share and direct benefits from cost reduction, as well as some productivity. Then we would expect -- if we do not have the downtime and slowbacks that we had in 2011 for project-related activities, which would add another $0.10 to get us to $0.31, and then we would not be able to capitalize interest as it relates to the project. So that would take away $0.05. So we gave an indication of about $0.26. Of course, the $0.10 on the demand will depend upon demand going throughout the rest of the year. The $0.21 in direct cost reduction and productivity, we really still -- we feel good about that, might be a little bit higher.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And to clarify that, I know that -- you noted earlier it wasn't linear. Is there a way to think about the first quarter, what we're getting on energy project, if there's a way to quantify that?","Paul T. Stecko","No, we're not going to get into that. There's so many factors that can influence, how much the energy project benefits are, whether it be prices, fuel prices, whether it be production. That's not something, Al, that we'd like to get into. We do think we're getting good benefits, especially by the fact that you don't have to buy as much fuel in colder weather. And that's a real positive.","Mark W. Kowlzan","Bottom line on that question with the number, we think if everything continues to run as well as we're seeing it run, there's actually upside to that number as we go forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Philip Ng from Jefferies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Inflation was obviously a headwind for you guys in 2011. It looks like the rate of change is declining and certainly what is working in your favor. How should we be thinking about inflation for 2012?","Paul T. Stecko","Well, it's hard to say. Who knows what's going to happen with weather conditions and how it impacts starch? That's a big component of our chemical cost, so that's going to be a big factor. Whatever happens to recycled fiber is going to be a big factor. And I would say third, transportation, what happens to oil prices can really impact our transportation costs. All I can say is from the cost that dropped significantly during the economic downturn, they're back, from our standpoint, more in line with pre-economic downturn levels. So intuitively, you would not expect the inflation to be as much in 2012 as you had in 2011.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then some of the other paper packaging companies, not necessarily in containerboard, have set a de-stocking. It doesn\u2019t seem like you saw any of that impacting Q4, but just want to get your -- any incremental color on that. And it looks like demand is off to a good start the first quarter. Are you seeing any restocking from your customers?","Richard B. West","No. I mean, we're not seeing anything to that effect.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, you quantified the export impact -- export price incoming impact for Q4. I think it was a $0.03 number. Can you quantify what the full quarter impact would be in Q1?","Mark W. Kowlzan","No. We don't break out the differentials. We'll report on that after we get our results.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from John Tumazos from Very Independent Research.","John Charles Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research, LLC","The recent natural gas prices in the low $2 are a big surprise. Would your energy-saving investments have paid off at current gas prices? And presumably, those investments are a necessary state in business, replace and update equipment nonetheless?","Mark W. Kowlzan","I think, even at the lower natural gas prices, the fact that the recovery boilers have improved their efficiency to convert liquor into chemicals and steam have improved so dramatically, the benefits still far outweighing the lowering gas price. So lower gas prices is just an incremental benefit in the entire picture right now. But the projects are still generating the returns that we would have expected.","Paul T. Stecko","Yes. Because you can't burn -- you'd have to burn so much liquor. You can't replace liquor with natural gas, or you couldn't make paper because you've got to recover the chemicals. And so the heart of our project has been in the recovery boilers, and we're just simply generating twice as much steam with the same amount of liquor. Now to make it -- and we're making electricity out of that steam, so we get another benefit. But the savings would have been less because we theoretically could have bought a turbine and made that electricity. But that remains to be seen because when utilities start burning gas, well, that means electricity prices are going to go up or down, and that natural gas is going to stay where it is. So it's a complicated question. But I would say, if we were on 100% gas, the return would have been less. But it's academic as we burn very little gas to start with. So we wouldn't have saved that much because we weren't burning gas anyway.","Operator","You have a follow-up question or comment from Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research.","Mark A. Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Just one clarification. Totally understood on the energy reinvestment grant that, that could come in the second quarter. In terms of the Black Liquor credits, does -- if that money comes to you, is that by way of lower cash taxes? Or is that additive? Is it a payment that you would get that would be separate from the cash tax rate being at 21%? Or what have you?","Mark W. Kowlzan","Yes. Rick, why don\u2019t you go ahead?","Richard B. West","Yes. It's not additive. What's built into the 21% cash tax rate is the continuing usage of the biofuel credits, getting from whether it be the 65 to the 167 dependent upon the IRS audit, it would just mean a continuation of that 21% cash tax rate longer. So it's just an additive amount to the amount of funds that we would have available to retain the 21% cash tax rate over time. Now that -- once again, just for clarification, the grant is separate. That is a cash payment from the government that we would receive all at once.","Operator","We have a follow-up question or comment from Mark Wilde from Deutsche Bank.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, just 2 real quick ones. Rick, that grant, you said you'd find about it in the second quarter. Is that also when you would receive the cash in all likelihood?","Richard B. West","Yes. If it is approved, we would receive the cash, hopefully in the second quarter. That's not a guarantee, but that's what we're looking at.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then the second question. Tom Hassfurther, I think you mentioned the you thought that the export volume and export pricing had bottomed or was bottoming, and I wondered if you could put any color around that?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","Well, it's really hard to put a lot of color around that. It's just speculation based on what we hear and that sort of stuff. Now keep in mind though that, as Paul mentioned earlier, our target markets in export have to do with long-term relationships, some specialty markets, heavyweights, some other things like that. So we're basing it on a customer base that we have and what we see going on with our customers. But of course, the big wild card, as we mentioned earlier, is currency. And depending on what goes on with the currency and the stability of the currency can dramatically impact what goes on certainly in Europe especially, but also obviously in South America and Central America.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. All right. And I had been picking up a little  bit recently that maybe there were some moves afoot to try to start to restore export pricing later here in the first quarter?","Thomas A. Hassfurther","Well, we don't comment on quotes.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Mark W. Kowlzan","If there are no more questions, thank you for joining us today.

Details of special items for both the fourth quarter and full year were included in the schedules that accompanied the earnings press release.","Excluding special items, the $0.10 per share reduction in fourth quarter 2014 earnings compared to the third quarter of 2014 was driven primarily by higher annual mill outage costs $0.07, lower white paper prices and mix $0.03, a seasonally less rich mix in corrugated products $0.03, lower corrugated product shipments with three less shipping days were $0.02, and higher wood costs $0.02. These items were partially offset by higher containerboard volume driven primarily by the production on D3 machine at the DeRidder, Louisiana mill for $0.04, and lower taxes $0.04 related in part to the passage of the federal tax extenders package in December.","In total, fourth quarter results came in where we expected except that White paper prices and mix were lower and taxes were better. Looking at more details of our fourth quarter operations, packaging EBITDA excluding special items was $250 million on sales of $1.122 billion which equates to a 22.3% margin. For the year excluding special items, packaging EBITDA was $1.015 billion and sales were $4.54 billion which equates to a 22.4% margin.","Containerboard production in the fourth quarter was 927,000 tons, up 69,000 [ph] tons over the third quarter of this year. The higher production was primarily from the DeRidder Number 3 machine which produced 58,000 tons during the quarter after starting up on October the 17. As a result of the D3 production, we were able to reduce the outside purchases of containerboard which averaged about 17,000 tons per month through October down to 4,500 tons in December.","In 2015, we plan to eliminate all purchases except for speciality grades that we do not produce. During the quarter we did increase our containerboard inventories by 45,000 tons. We need the addition of inventories during the first half of 2015 to help offset reduce production with four of our five containerboard mills down for their annual outages.","In the first quarter our two largest mills, Counce and DeRidder will be down and together with these two outages will reduce production by about 40,000 tons. The Counce outage will continue into the second quarter and will also have our Tomahawk and Filer City media mills down for their outages. In addition, in the first quarter there are two less mill production days than in the fourth quarter with February being the 28th day month, so that is an additional 20,000 ton less production bringing the total loss production to 60,000 tons.","Fortunately we will have the D3 machine available for the full quarter so that along with our other mills running well should offset some of the loss production. I now would like to turn it over to Tom, who will provide more details on PCA\u2019s containerboard and corrugated packaging sales and demand.","Tom Hassfurther","Thank you, Mark. Our corrugated products demand was strong and steady throughout the quarter. With the partial quarter of Boise shipments after the October 2013 acquisition. Corrugated products shipments were up 11% over the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding Boise, PCA\u2019s fourth quarter shipments were up 5.4% in total and per workday with the same number of workdays each year.","The acquisition of Crockett Packaging in April 2014 contributed about 1.5% of the shipments increase. For the year, PCAs corrugated product shipments excluding Boise were up 4.7% in total and 4.3% per workday with one more workday and about 1% of the increase came from the acquisition of Crockett. Including Boise, PCA shipments for the year were up in total 25.5% and per workday 25%.","Prices for corrugated containers were essentially flat during the fourth quarter, but mix was seasonally weaker in the last half of the quarter maybe a little more than normal as we are seeing some customers moving more of their display and other value added business earlier in the year.","Our outside sales of containerboard were up 5000 tons compared with the third quarter and down about 7000 tons compared with the fourth quarter of last year including Boise tons in both years. Pricing for domestic containerboard sales was flat with the third quarter. Export prices were down a little in the quarter with reduced earnings by about a $0.01 [ph].","Looking at current corrugated shipments data for the first 13 days of January PCA bookings for corrugated products are up 5% over the same period last year and shipments are up 7.4% so we were off to a good start in the first quarter. I should note however for comparison purposes the shipments numbers are probably overstated by about 2% because January 2nd was not a recognized FDA shipping day but about half of our box plant operated that day.","I will now turn it over to Judy Lassa, who will discuss white papers.","Judy Lassa","Thank you, Tom. Our paper segment EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2014, was $45 million on sales of $284 million, which equates to a 15.8% margin. Our white paper mills ran well, producing 287,000 tons in the fourth quarter. We did have our Jackson, Alabama mill down seven days in November for its annual maintenance outage, which reduced production by about 10,000 tons and increased operating costs.","Office paper shipments during the fourth quarter were down 6% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. During the past year, we elected to exit some business which reduced our shipments. Printing and converting and pressure-sensitive paper shipments were down 12,500 tons compared to last year\u2019s fourth quarter, driven by the International Falls Minnesota machine closures in the fourth quarter of last year.","Industry publications reduced office paper prices by $10 per ton in November and an additional $5 per ton in December. The November price reduction did impact our fourth quarter office paper prices. Our overall mix was unfavourable and we saw slightly lower prices for both printing and converting and pressure sensitive papers.","Excluding special items, 2014 EBITDA was $186 million, up $53 million or 40% from 2013 full year EBITDA which included two periods owned by Boise and PCA. Sales were $1.2 billion in 2014.","I will now turn it over to Rick West.","Richard West","Thank you, Judy. PCA generated cash from operations in the fourth quarter of $179 million and for the year $736 million. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $165 million and for the year $420 million. Common stock dividends of $39 million or $0.40 per share were paid in the fourth quarter and we made $78 million of cash tax payments","Total debt reduction since the acquisition of Boise on October 25, 2013 is $300 million, and our long-term debt is now at $2.355 billion. We ended the quarter with $125 million in cash on hand. As we normally do at the beginning of each year, PCA provides estimates for certain 2015 [ph] items. We expect total capital expenditures to be between $275 million to $300 million.","DD&A is expected to be $345 million, up $5 million over 2014 recurring DD&A which excludes accelerated depreciation for the DeRidder restructuring. Pension expense is expected to be $30 million, up $5 million over 2014. We expect to make minimal cash, pension payments. The combined federal in state effective in cash tax rate is expected to average about 35.5%. Based on our current long term debt with current LIBOR rates, interest expense in 2015 would be about $90 million and cash interest payments would be about $86 million, up $9 million over 2014.","Based on current plan annual maintenance outages at our mills, the total earnings of these impact of these outages including loss production, the direct cost that could increase is associated with the outages and repair cost during the outages is expected to be $0.55 per share. The current estimated impact by quarter in 2015 is $0.13 per share in 1Q, $0.16 per share in 2Q, $0.08 per share in 3Q and $0.18 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015.","In terms of MLPs we do not have anything new to report on our MLP deliberations other than we are continuing our modelling and tax analysis efforts as we await action from the IRS on our request for a private letter ruling which was filed in November. Before I turn it over to Mark, beginning with reporting our first quarter 2015 results in April, we will return to reporting our year-over-year results rather than sequentially quarter to quarter. We now have a full year\u2019s operation with Boise, which for comparison purposes will allow us to go back to our traditional method of reporting results.","I will now turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Kowlzan","Thank you, Rick. In summary, 2014 was a very successful transitional year for PCA with the integration of the Boise acquisition and the completion of the redesigned, rebuilt and start up of the DeRidder number 3 machine to produce containerboard. All areas of the company worked hard to accomplish these objectives and it shows in our reported results, with earnings per share up 40% and EBITDA up 52% excluding special items.","As you know we raised our synergy estimates after the Boise acquisition from $105 million at the time of the acquisition to $175 million on July 22, 2014 when we reported second quarter earnings. During 2014, synergies of $100 million or $0.65 per share were realized. Over the next two years we are now estimating that our total synergies will increase from $175 million to $200 million.","Looking ahead, our earnings in the first quarter are normally lower than the fourth quarter and that is again the case this year. We expect loss containerboard production of about 60,000 tons and higher operating cost from annual maintenance downtime at our two large containerboard mills and two less production days compared to the fourth quarter. This will be essentially offset by lower amortization of annual outage repair cost. Corrugated product shipments are expected to be seasonally lower and white paper prices are expected to be lower with a full quarter\u2019s impact of published price decreases.","Seasonally colder weather will increase wood, energy and chemical cost. In addition, labor and benefit cost will be higher with annual wage increases and timing related benefit payments. These items will be partially offset by the higher production on D3 paper machine and lower interest expense from an annual interest rebate on a portion of our debt. Everything considered, we currently expect first quarter earnings of $1.07 per share to $1.10 per share.","With that, we\u2019d be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you some of the statements we\u2019ve made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. These statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.","With that, Operator, I\u2019d like to open the call for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America","George Staphos","Congratulations on the year and thanks for the detail. My general line of questioning is aimed at either trying to bridge into first quarter or look at year-on-year trends. I guess the first question I had is, you know if we look at the impact of Boise both in terms of synergies and the add from D3, is it possible to isolate how much EBITDA that contributed in fourth quarter and\/or into the first quarter when we look back at prior year period?","And then, the second question I had, we remember first quarter last year there was significant weather-related issues for all the companies, yourself included. I think the number was around $0.06 a share that you had called out. I was wondering if we shouldn't be seeing more benefit of that in your year-on-year comparisons this year, and if there's anything that from an operating standpoint, or market standpoint, has cropped up that's a little bit more of a headwind than you would have expected. Thank you.","Richard West","Okay [ph] George I\u2019ll take a shot at those questions. Let me start first with looking at 1Q 2015 earnings guidance you know versus last year\u2019s first quarter the $1.08 per share. And you know if we look for things it should improve last year\u2019s first quarter earnings of $1.08 per share compared to this year\u2019s first quarter earnings, we do have additional synergies of $0.16 per share compared to last year\u2019s first quarter.","And that equates to about $100 million more work. We had $25 million annual run rate in the first quarter of last year with all of the things we did immediately after the acquisition. We now have the additional $100 million in the first quarter of this year so that adds $0.16 per share. Secondly, if you look at our corrugated products growth for last year and our mill production that adds an additional $0.10 per share so a total of $0.26 per share compared to last year.","There is three items that offset that. The first item is that we do have higher annual outage cost in this year\u2019s first quarter compared to last year\u2019s first quarter up $0.07 per share and last year\u2019s first quarter we only had the Counse mill down, and which was about 22,000 tons. In this year\u2019s first quarter we have both the Counse and DeRidder mills down. The DeRidder mill was not down last year, it was a year that we did not have an outage, this year is the more extended outage and if we do have some additional direct cost in buying purchase electricity because we have the turbine down for a seven year inspection which does make the number higher, so that\u2019s $0.07 per share off.","In addition to that, a normal inflation and other cost increases after taking into account the positive impact of natural gas and some other what I would call deflationary items. The net of the inflation is $0.10 per share year-over-year, so that\u2019s a hit turning to $0.10 per share.","Finally, and looking at price and mix compared to last year\u2019s first quarter, that down about $0.10 per share and is primarily an export containerboard in white papers. Now in terms of the bad weather last year if I recall correctly we did say some of that showed up in the first quarter, some of it showed up in the second quarter. In terms of this year, one of the reasons that we gave the range of $1.07 to $1.10 is the factor of whether not knowing what will occur for the remainder of the quarter, and so that\u2019s what is represented in the range.","So that\u2019s basically year-over-year a lay out of our earnings. And as Mark said earlier in relation to your other question with Boise, contribution to PCAs earnings and I\u2019ll just say for the full year he said, we did realize a $100 million of synergies plus the EBITDA that we purchased, so they were a major part of our increase in earnings year-over-year.","George Staphos","Thank you, that\u2019s very helpful.","Mark Kowlzan","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research","Mark Kowlzan","Good morning, Mark.","Mark Weintraub","And following up a little bit more on that, and trying to understand, so the additional $0.07 outage, you had previously mentioned that in total there is $0.55 for all outages this year. Was that a similar apples-to-apples number being used there? It says the outage, the $0.07 you were talking about does that include lost production that's not included in the $0.55, all outages numbers you had talked about previously?","Richard West","It\u2019s a comparative number for all periods in the first quarter of last year. Our total outage cost was about $0.07 per share and this year it\u2019s about $13.5 per share and that does include all three components. In the press release we did say and looking at 3Q to 4Q when you take into account all of the items that make up the difference in the 60,000 tons which includes the outages plus the two additional, the two days of less production driven by February, that\u2019s really offset by the lower repair cost amortization which does go from the fourth quarter from $0.14 to zero. So you\u2019re getting a $0.14 positive, but that\u2019s going from 4Q to 1Q. But in terms of the overall impact for the year with the DeRidder outage we\u2019re going from a total annual outage cost in 2014 of about $0.48 per share to about $0.55 as I said earlier for 2015 and all of that is being driven by the DeRidder outage in the first quarter of the additional $0.06 so we are absorbing that entire increase in the first quarter.","Mark Kowlzan","And Mark as Rick said earlier the reason for that big difference is we had no annual outage at DeRidder last year. And we have an extra one and its \u2013 it\u2019s now our largest mill.","Mark Weintraub","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And just quick follow up if I could, on the, the synergies I think you indicated that you\u2019re at -- at about $125 million run rate expected for this quarter your target is now for $200 can you give us a sense of the timeline of when you would expect to get to that $200 million run rate?","Richard West","Yes, Mark you know we are anticipating over the next two years 2015, 2016 we should achieve that and again as the year rolled on last year we continued to discover little opportunities. One example of that is the new turbine generator that we are currently installing currently International Falls mills so that\u2019s just an example of our internal project that we\u2019ve gone after very quickly to bring to the bottom line, reduce energy and efficiency of the mill.","Paul Stecko","Yes I guess another one Mark, this is Paul Stecko that we can mention and Mark and his people have done some outstanding work at DeRidder which is a pulp limited mill. We\u2019re out of pulping capacity there that\u2019s why we buy purchase OCC for D3. But we have come up with some very good ideas to debottle neck the pulp mill and get more pulp production and we\u2019re making some changes as a matter of fact they will get some of that on its annual outage here in the brown stock washing area, but that is a fairly good part of the reason we\u2019ve increased the synergies because of the additional pulp capacity we can bring on in a pulp limited mill.","Mark Weintraub","Great. Thanks very much.","Mark Kowlzan","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon from Vertical Research","Chip Dillon","Yes, good morning. Could you talk about the DeRidder ramp-up? I know you started that in October and you usually take some time before you get the full benefit. I think you were saying you expect it to have a net benefit of about $60 million of EBITDA. And I know some of that is from the forgone purchases. So could you tell us sort of where we stand with that and how much more is left?","Richard West","Yes, when we started off in October we talked about the anticipated curve and at this point we are very pleased with where we are. We did realize about $0.04 I believe on the fourth quarter benefit from the production of that machine. And as you would expect you know during the start up period, start up expenses costs are going to be higher. So that would impact the benefit and you know again net benefit is down initially.","And as time rolls on your cost reduced, your efficiency is improved. And again we did take advantage of the time in the late November, early December to do a lot of great development which we had not anticipate, and not anticipated being able to take advantage of until later. So that was some of the costs that was incurred, but again it help to get ahead of the curve and prepare the machine to supply necessary tons into our system. So again with the numbers that we did layout for the project, we still standby the numbers and again, I think you\u2019ll see that as the year goes on, that the machine has been performing well,","I think if you look at the machine performance on efficiency basis the DeRidder 3 machine is running as well as any other machine in our legacy system, so quite pleased. And again what Paul has said about the work we\u2019ve been doing with the pulp mill we have been able to free up more virgin capacity and that has allowed us to undertake the great development sooner, and so we\u2019re pleased there. So again we\u2019re still holding with the numbers we had thought. ","Richard West","Yes. Let me just add one thing. When the startup of the machine, this is a very difficult conversation, we\u2019re doing some things that haven\u2019t been done before and we\u2019re in even for our own self and some uncharted regions. And we have had a few problems along the way, minor in nature that will rectify during our outage at DeRidder in the first quarter. Mark said our efficiencies are very good and they all are, but we\u2019re not able to run that machine full speed yet because of some modifications that we have to make, and we will make. So we\u2019re been held back little bit on top end in terms of making a lot more tons until we correct a few things.","But the good news is we\u2019re excited about that of what this machine can do and what we\u2019ve found in our great development activities, now we just got to make some modifications. That\u2019s the first point. And that will be completed by the end of first quarter. Secondly on the startup you have two types of startups. One is on production. Can you ramp this machine up from nothing to 1000 tons a day and that\u2019s one objective.","But when you startup a new machine you also experience higher cost for a lot of reasons, everything new and [indiscernible] run and once you get up to a speed and while you\u2019re doing that you also have to work on a lot of things to reduce the cost of production. We expect two things over the next three to six months on this machine, production will go up and cost will come down and those two together will drive the productivity, that kind of numbers that we think this machine is capable of. So I just want to amplify a little bit on that point.","Chip Dillon","Got you. That's helpful. And then just one quick follow-up, we've seen in the last few months a number of other players, if you will forward integrate into box plants, and that's been a strategy you guys have had. And could you, I guess, update us on where you see your integration level right now? And secondly, do you feel you want to continue to move that up and is it getting more challenging to get attractive box plant assets given the competition for them out there?","Mark Kowlzan","Yes. Chip, with the startup of the DeRidder machine, we brought our integration level down from the low 90s into the mid 80s and from full year the integration were been 90%, but again with the capacity that DeRidder 3 is delivering again we\u2019re back down into that mid-80 range. So it presents an opportunity for Tom\u2019s side of the business to continue to grow. Tom you want to add to that.","Tom Hassfurther","Well, I would say that we continue to have a target that\u2019s 90 plus in terms of our integrations. So, we\u2019ll be looking obviously to continue grow our business organically and we\u2019ll take advantage of the acquisitions that present themselves when they come along.","Chip Dillon","Okay. Thank you.","Tom Hassfurther","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettanari from Citigroup.","Anthony Pettanari","Hi. Good morning.","Mark Kowlzan","Good morning, Anthony.","Anthony Pettanari","If I look at your EBITDA per ton in corrugated, it was significantly lower year over year. And you indicated containerboard prices were mostly flat. You also talked about the DeRidder startup and some of the mill outage expenses. Paul, you reference getting out some of the kinks in DeRidder. As we go to 2Q, 3Q, assuming prices are flat, would you expect your EBITDA per ton in corrugated to kind of get back to the levels that it was for most of 2014?","Paul Stecko","Well, as Tom said earlier that the biggest change in corrugated in the fourth quarter was mix. And Tom elaborate if you recall on our last call that we had a surprise and our mix was richer in the third quarter and he speculated that time that some of the people in order to make sure they get all their product that in time were move into display business and some of the high end stuff earlier in the year. And that turn got to be the case, because our real high end business displays, et cetera were less in the fourth quarter than we anticipated. For the full year they were about where we thought, but they move them earlier in the year and then we had one accounting change that affected the EBITDA margin which will go away. But Tom you want to comment on that mix thing first.","Tom Hassfurther","Well, I would just say exactly basically what you say Paul, when we were on the third quarter call if you recall, our mix was significantly better and a lot of that was due to the fact that our value added business was significantly. And we speculated that at that time that many of our customers were moving those Christmas orders up, as an example, and that\u2019s just because seasonally this Christmas season and this push keeps moving up earlier in the year. And that held true to perform in the fourth quarter and that\u2019s why our mix was a down a little bit on that value added business. And now you just kind of see the Christmas season as it evolves its I think much more oriented towards the big box and the department stores earlier in the year and then as the year winds on the internet sales really pick up. So that\u2019s the cover I had.","Paul Stecko","And Rick you want to comment on the accounting item.","Richard West","Yes. You know, right now with the integration of the Boise we\u2019re still operating in two different basis in terms of systems and more so on the pay roll system, their payroll system and our existing methods of paying product. So at the end of the year you try to look at everything to ensure that you have it in the proper bucket. So we had to move about $3 million of labor-related costs from the corporate segment back to the packaging segment in the fourth quarter. So you took a full year hit in the fourth quarter whereas it should have been about $500 million, you know $600 million per quarter, $600 million to $700 million per quarter. Excuse me, $600,000 to $700,000 per quarter versus the $3 million in the fourth quarter. So that $3 million also affected the margin in containerboard and that should have been spread across the year. So, the first three quarters were over stated, just a touch and the fourth quarter caught it up.","Anthony Pettanari","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful detail. Then maybe just a follow on for Judy. You know you\u2019d spoke about potentially exiting some white paper business. Is that continuing in 1Q, or is there any color you can give us around that?","Judy Lassa","No. I mean, I think it was just the changes that we made in 2014 and part of that was due to reshuffling our system with the I Falls reconfiguration.","Anthony Pettanari","Okay. So that process is largely over.","Judy Lassa","Yes.","Anthony Pettanari","Okay. I\u2019ll turn it over. Thank you.","Mark Kowlzan","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey from Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey","Hey, good morning everyone.","Mark Kowlzan","Good morning.","Alex Ovshey","I wanted to go back to the earnings bridge on a year-over-year basis for the first quarter. You talked about $0.10 of higher costs with labor, other costs being partly offset by impacts of lower energy. Can you maybe elaborate a little bit more on some of the cost buckets that you're seeing that are inflationary? And maybe thinking about the full year, is that $0.10 sort of something we can annualize and assume that there is sort of $0.40 of cost inflation the business will see on an annual basis? Or is it a high $0.10 number in the first quarter and then potentially tapers off as we move through the year?","Richard West","It\u2019s a couple of both, you know, if you look at the first quarter, there\u2019s a coupe of things that hit you all with sudden compared to the fourth quarter. The first is that for the most part of all our salaried employees received their annual waging freeze on January 1st. So that\u2019s an immediate increase in fourth quarter to first quarter. Also the majority of our union contracts for all hourly employees move up in January. So that\u2019s an immediate increase. The third item that\u2019s an immediate increase in fourth quarter to first quarter is the fact that certain statutory benefits such as FICA are paid out earlier in the year and they start backup in the first quarter and then they wind down. And then there are certain benefit-related payments that come in the first quarter and then they go down.","So in terms of the labor inflation there\u2019s a portion of it that winds down, there\u2019s portion of its fits more so in the annual wage increases. In terms of \u2013 and that\u2019s probably the biggest item that you see in a negative inflation. We\u2019ve also had some in freight year-over-year and everybody is aware of that, the continuing problems with rail and truck availability that\u2019s driving up the costs into large extend offsetting the positive benefits of oil or diesel prices. You do get a really good benefit in natural gas. We do burn more natural gas than we use to with the additional white paper mills and the DeRidder mills, so that is a benefit. But if you think about it on a overall standpoint it\u2019s very difficult. You can predict to some extend the inflation for annual wages which are generally 2.5%, 3%. Your other benefit primarily medical you\u2019re aware of how much that goes up every year.","But in total you have to realize that when you look at our cost to good sold and our SG&A, excluding depreciation and you can take it right off the 2014 press release, its about $4.5 billion. So you\u2019ve got to put enough percentage to that what you think a lot of the factors would be and I\u2019ve talked about a few, but it is a large number. And so I can\u2019t predict the inflation to any great extent of the overall year, but there are certain things of course that we had last year\u2019s you can see by the year-over-year comparison for 1Q to 1Q, but that will be a number that we will have to overcome in the 2015 by whatever we can do and we have some positives going into 2015.","Paul Stecko","Yes. I\u2019ll add to that. We don\u2019t give full year forecast. We give quarter over quarter forecast and Rick did say that we\u2019ll taken a more of hit in labor this quarter than we will the other quarters. But coming up with inflation for the year its anybody\u2019s guess we got roughly $4.5 billion if we have 1% inflation overall. That\u2019s $45 million. If we have 2% inflation that\u2019s $90 million. So my guess this is going to be in 1% to 2% range. Where? I really don\u2019t know. And we cannot speak up on that quarter by quarter.","Alex Ovshey","Okay. That\u2019s fair. And then just D3 now that it's running, can you just update us on what you expect the operating capacity of that machine to be on a full-year basis \u2013 not necessarily production, but just what the stated capacity would be and whether it's changed since the last time there was an update? And, then, what's the expected fiber furnish for the facility and what percentage if it is Virgin versus OCC based?","Mark Kowlzan","Yes. When we announced the project, we said, our believe its going to be 355,000 ton a year type projects in that\u2019s what we're looking at right now. And the fiber furnished, again the opportunities we have, depending on whether we choose to make medium or liners, we can utilize the OCC plan we can go 100% recycled fiber all the way up to a blend of say 70% Virgin and 30% OCC. So, we have a tremendous amount of flexibility on the machine and with were coming up a month from now on the, mill, we will enhance that capability and ensure that we have that mix of 70\/30 if we choose to make liner on the machine.","Alex Ovshey","Okay, great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Mark Kowlzan","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Philip Ng from Jefferies.","Philip Ng","Good morning, guys. Quick question on prices on the export front. Have you seen it stabilize a bit? I know in the trade publications, it seems like it has taken much of a decline. Have you seen a further decline in January? And can you talk about what your thoughts are in pricing or starting to see it stabilizing in Q1?","Tom Hassfurther","Phil, this is Tom, I\u2019ll take the first question on export prices. They came down a touch and they basically had stayed there. We don\u2019t speculate going forward on what we expect prices to do, but that\u2019s all I can tell you as where it is at this point. Judy to want to take the other question.","Judy Lassa","[indiscernible] Tom.","Tom Hassfurther","What paper prices going forward again, we don\u2019t forecast where prices are going. As Judy mentioned, trade publication which we tied to throughout the prices, $10 in November, $5 in December.","Judy Lassa","$5 in November and then $10 in December.","Tom Hassfurther","Yes. I said it backward. I\u2019m sorry. So, we only hit \u2013 we only got a partial quarter hit on that. We\u2019ll get the entire quarter hit in the first quarter and we\u2019re white paper prices are going are going to depend on a lot of things, the economy is it going to get a little more robust with all the cash available what that you\u2019re saving on gasoline. That\u2019s a positive. Where our imports going to go in terms of up or down or in that regard, so its something that remains to be seen there, we\u2019re not offering any forward price estimates at this point.","Philip Ng","Okay. And I appreciate the color you provided earlier about your 1Q guidance with 1Q seeing a larger to normal hit with the maintenance expense in some inflation. How should we think about the $0.06 hit on maintenance if 1Q been spread out in a more favorable fashion in remaining quarters? Is it pretty evenly spread out or it is more 2Q centric?","Richard West","Well, I gave the numbers. We took the year-over-year increase totally in the first quarter and when I gave the numbers for the $0.55 per share in 2015, the overall cost of outages in the first quarter is $0.13 per share. The overall cost for outages in the second quarter that we see is $0.16 per share, because we\u2019ve got additional time at Counce, Tomahawk, Filer City and we begin to amortize repair costs. In the third quarter, it goes down all the way to $0.08 per share because we essentially have very little downtime in the third quarter. And then, in the fourth quarter it goes up dramatically because there are outages as well as the full recognition of repair cost. So it goes up to $0.18 per share. So in terms of the increase year-over-year it is all in the first quarter.","Philip Ng","Okay. That\u2019s helpful, Rick. And just one last question, I know, if you guys can talk about this, it still pretty early. Any update on how we should be thinking about anti-dumping case as it relates to white paper and how that kind of impacted to you in a positive or negative way in coming quarters?","Richard West","You know, again what you\u2019ve seen in the press with the announcement of the case, its in the hands of the government in terms of the Department of Commerce and International Trade Commission to go and do their investigation, so that\u2019s really will say at this time.","Philip Ng","Okay. Thanks guys.","Richard West","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones from Deutsche Bank.","Debbie Jones","Thanks You did a pretty commendable job outpacing the industry in the corrugated demand growth. I was just wondering out of the Boise acquisition, should be continued to see PKG outpace industry in 2015? Or do you think you\u2019re being more normalized with the industry trend? ","Mark Kowlzan","Debbie we would expect to grow our businesses like we\u2019ve always grown our business both organically and through acquisition. So, I would \u2013 I think it would be pretty obvious that we will continue to outpace the industry or that\u2019s certainly is our expectation.","Paul Stecko","And it\u2019s Paul Stecko. Debbie add to that, that\u2019s our goal, goal is different than performance, so the only performance data is, we\u2019re up a bunch the first half of January and so we\u2019re off to a good start, so the rest of the year we hope that continue that trend but two-thirds of a month data doesn\u2019t make a trend yet, but we\u2019re off to a good start.","Debbie Jones","Okay. Thank you. Yes. I think it make sense year-to-date you\u2019ve been better but I\u2019m just wondering, so I kind of looking out what you\u2019re hearing from your customers seems relatively positive and that\u2019s helpful. I\u2019m also knowing if you\u2019re\u2026.","Paul Stecko","They keep telling us they like us. So, that's all about I can tell you there.","Debbie Jones","All right. That\u2019s good to hear. I\u2019m also wondering if anything is change over the last month kind of impact your thoughts on capital allocation, dividend, share buybacks or debt pay down, the goals that\u2019s you kind of already stated?","Paul Stecko","No. We do have the positives of having our debt refinancing down that took us out of the way and takes away some of the urgency to pay down debt and our balance sheet is in very good shape. So we\u2019ll continue to look to return cash to shareholders and whether it would be dividends or whether it would be share repurchases and we think we\u2019re in a good position going into 2015 to do that with lower capital expenditures as I said earlier today. And we\u2019ll be looking at that as the year progress.","Richard West","Yes. We\u2019ll still pay debt off, but we won\u2019t pay as much as we originally thought and that hasn\u2019t changed.","Debbie Jones","Thank you very much. Good luck in the quarter.","Paul Stecko","Thanks. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo Securities.","Chris Manuel","Good morning, gentlemen.","Paul Stecko","Good morning.","Chris Manuel","First question I want to ask was as we look at that the new DeRidder machine, 355,000 tons, let\u2019s call it roughly a ton a day. It looks like you are bit below that in the 4Q?","Mark Kowlzan","Ton a day is not right, you got to carry the three desks [ph], you got to carry three zeros.","Chris Manuel","Okay. I apologize, so -- but I guess from what it is when you look at your per day rate it look bit late in 4Q where you\u2019re running. However you talked about getting some of the improvements in some of the different elements experience running a machine and something that cost out et cetera. As you\u2019re running it today, are you close to rated run rate on the machine or you still running a bit below?","Mark Kowlzan","You know again we talk to earnings calls in October, we expected to make about 50,000 tons. We made 58,000 tons. We exceeded the startup curve period for the 4Q. And then again as we ran the machine and learned about the capabilities of machine, again, in order to produce some of the liner grades that we had not expected to produce until later we did run slower and we were taking advantage of the virgin crafts fiber which became available, and again, identifying opportunities on how to utilize that virgin craft. So again for 4Q we actually exceeded the curve expectations on tons per day.","And then again with current mix of linerboard and media being produced on the machine, we are still going according to the curve and we will take advantage as Paul said with the shutdown coming up a month from now with some modifications in some equipment that we\u2019re installing and that will better enable us to take advantage of craft fiber and then theoretically move the speed up and move the productivity up to a higher level.","Richard West","For the quarter you know Mark just said we made 58,000 tons, you divide that by the number of days we ran to get about 600 tons a day of the 1000 and we\u2019ve move that up over the quarter. So 600 [ph] was the average, we obviously exceeded the year at a higher number than that if you average 600 [ph] but we started out at zero and we\u2019re not at the 1000 and we need to a little bit of work on the machine we\u2019ll get up to the 1000 but we\u2019re fairly close.","Chris Manuel","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. My second question was and Rick, thank you much for running kind of to the bridge on a quarter-over-quarter basis or how we think about that, but I guess the one element that I was unclear about or wanted to get a little bit more color on was when you think about your rolling assumptions, you talked about thus far through quarter you were up mid single digit, upper single digit depending on how you looked at your extra day thus far. But where were that fit with in the bridge. It would seem as though \u2013 maybe have you bake that in somewhere and I just wasn\u2019t aware of it \u2013 a higher volume performance?","Richard West","I think that when we do a bridge year-over-year we bridge it representative of what we\u2019ve been able to accomplish and that\u2019s even when we go from 1Q, 2014 to 1Q, 2015 where we\u2019re basically expecting the same type of growth as Tom said in his call and what we\u2019ve experience historically. So we have built that number into our first quarter number year-over-year.","Chris Manuel","Okay. So you are embedding up somewhat low single digit sort of number in there. I\u2019m with you then. Okay. Thank you.","Mark Kowlzan","Absolutely, because I saw what you can do it looking over year-over-year as to how did you do last year and what are envisioning for your growth this year to help to offset the inflation that normally occurs.","Chris Manuel","Thank you.","Mark Kowlzan","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner from Barclays.","Scott Gaffner","Hey.","Mark Kowlzan","Good morning.","Scott Gaffner","Just going back to your prior question on your growth versus the market as you continue to grow you get to be more of a proxy for the entire market I would think. Historically my understanding as you grown through going after some highly profitable niche business, I guess my question is more centered on, how long do you think that can last? Is there plenty of that highly profitable niche type business out there for you to go after? Is it couple of years to get to be more like average or do you think there\u2019s longer runway than that?","Tom Hassfurther","Scott, this is Tom. You know, I think one way to answer this, to take a look back first and to kind of look at our performance and we\u2019ve got a long track record grow on the business certainly more than the industry has. And we\u2019ve done in a lot of different ways and I\u2019m not going to disclose all those best kept secrets here on the call. But I can tell you that our expectation is that we will continue to do that. We see plenty of opportunities to do that. We positioned ourselves in a way with our customer base and with type of customers and the type of products we produce and that\u2019s \u2013 so you know, it\u2019s been good to us and we continue to see those opportunities.","Paul Stecko","And this is Paul Stecko. I want to add to what you said. We\u2019re selective in the type of business we want to pursue and we can be selective because we\u2019re only 10% of the market. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re 50% to 60% of the market. We still have the other 90% of the market that we can be selective and so we\u2019ve got a lot of room to grow. And if we increased our volume by 50 more percent now it took us roughly a decade to increase 50% go through about 6.5% to 10%, that\u2019s a 50% increase. If we increased another 50% that would only take us through a 15% mortgage share, so we\u2019ve got a lot of runway when we get to a much bigger number I think that question may come into the play. But that\u2019s going to be quite a way out.","Scott Gaffner","Fair enough. And then on the demand trends within the quarter, I don\u2019t know if I missed that or not, but can you talk about how things \u2013 you talk about the mix through shifting as the quarter when on, but how were the sequential sales trends within the corrugated market throughout the fourth quarter?","Tom Hassfurther","Well, the fourth quarter was very good and the demand was strong and steady as I mentioned. And then I also shared with you what the bookings look like so far in the first quarter, which were up 5% over the same period last year and shipments were about 7.4% which probably will equate something to closer to about 5.5% ones we compare actual days.","Scott Gaffner","Okay.","Tom Hassfurther","So, we\u2019re off to a very good start.","Scott Gaffner","Right. But no meaningful difference say, October, November, December of the fourth quarter, any one month, okay?","Tom Hassfurther","Pretty steady.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. And then just last question you did mentioned ecommerce really picking up late in the quarter and sort of taking the growth manual away from or taking over for the display business. Any idea now how much ecommerce represents of the total business, means, is this enough now to really move the needle within the Company?","Richard West","We don\u2019t really break that out and talk about exactly about what portion ecommerce is and quite frankly it still a hard number to get your arms around because lot of customers do both. They are in both segments. So it\u2019s tougher to get your arms around. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that the needle doesn\u2019t get move on ecommerce and that\u2019s become a growth area certainly for the industry.","Scott Gaffner","Great. Thanks for all the color.","Mark Kowlzan","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Al Kabili from Macquarie.","Al Kabili","Good morning. I wanted to just clarify the year-over-year headwind on the price mix of $0.10 per share that I think Rick mentioned in the first quarter. If I think about paper prices, they were trending up early last year. And, so, the year-over-year variance, I wouldn't think, is too much on the paper price side. On the export side, clearly dollar prices are down. But fortunately you expert a lot less than most so I wouldn't think that's hugely material. So I'm struggling a little bit with what drives that large of a $0.10 price mix hit year over year?","Mark Kowlzan","Judy you want to take whitepapers.","Judy Lassa","Yeah. I mean, again we are up year-over-year, but as Paul mentioned before in Q1 we do have some headwinds with the publication prices dropping?","Mark Kowlzan","Yes. To recall last year there were announcements, but it took trade publications forever to recognize them and they all didn\u2019t go up in January, it took through into the second quarter before they got fully realized and both them didn\u2019t get totally realized anyway. So, there\u2019s a lag in prices than went up and now they fallen back.","So its kind timing issue that you didn\u2019t get that price increase effective all January 1st. Most of it was not in the first quarter in terms of realization. So that\u2019s one and of course export prices have fallen as you mentioned and then the trade publications move the price to medium down over the year. I think $20 on a West Coast and $10 in the East, so that affected us to and so that\u2019s basically the major movers that changed them.","Al Kabili","Okay. Because the point on the pricing, right, so the year-over-year variance, because there was the lag, I guess that's what I was trying to get at, that wouldn't be so much of a negative year-over-year variance because of the lag. If anything, it may even be slightly positive. And so medium is a small factor, open-market medium prices for you. So I'm just struggling. Is it mostly mix that's driving that year-over-year kind of headwind? Is there something going on with mix that we are not appreciating? And do you see this type of a headwind? I know you don't give guidance, but do you see this kind of a headwind continuing throughout the remainder of the year, as well?","Mark Kowlzan","Well, let Judy take the mix question, but on price, the price is down year-over-year for the reason I just went through. We didn\u2019t get most of the price until the second quarter and so then it went up and then down, so our price at until December over December were down compared to last year. So it\u2019s a negative because of the timing of when it went through and Judy you may talk about mix.","Judy Lassa","Yes. On the white paper side of thing we do have a mix issue in first quarter in addition to the publications moving. We actually, if you look at our office in our TMC [ph], we actually are ahead and there is just a mix with pressure sensitive and pulp that are making it lower.","Al Kabili","Okay. All right. And on the containerboard side, I mean, is there any notable mix change year-over-year we\u2019re assuming in 1Q or is mostly the mix is on the paper side?","Mark Kowlzan","Yes. There is a just a slight variance in mix for us on the containerboard corrugated side in Q1. But the two best quarters for mix in containerboard in the second and third quarters. And the two weeks is to the first and the fourth.","Al Kabili","Yeah. Okay.","Mark Kowlzan","But year-over-year we expect that to be about the same.","Al Kabili","Okay. All right. Thank you for that. On the \u2013 I guess just final follow-up question from me, Rick, just on total outage expense, in totality I believe the $0.55 will be pretty similar to 2014, so its just a matter of sort of the timing of the total maintenance outage expenses when it hits in the quarter, is that fair? Maybe its up $0.03, $0.04 year-over-year in total?","Richard West","No. I said it was up about $0.07 year-over-year, and its all in the first quarter that we have the additional hit because of DeRidder. In terms of the outages year-over-year in last year in the first quarter we have $0.07. This year we have $0.13. Last year in the second quarter we had about $0.11. This year we have $0.16. Last year in the third quarter we had $0.12. This year we had $0.08. Last year we had $0.18 in the fourth quarter. This year we have $0.18 in the fourth quarter. So the $0.06 per share increase, $0.6 to $0.07 is in the first quarter and then you have some shifts between the second and the third quarter with the third quarter this year being lower based upon the timing of when the outages occur.","Al Kabili","Okay. Got it. All right. That's what I was trying to get it. That helps a bunch. I appreciate it. And yeah, good luck the rest of the year, here. Thanks.","Richard West","Thanks. Operator we have time for one more question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wide from Bank of Montreal.","Richard West","Good morning, Mark.","Mark Wide","Outside your business we have had a lot of currency movements including some pretty big ones in Latin America?","Richard West","I\u2019m sorry Mark, we missed the first part of your question, could you repeat that?","Mark Wide","Yes, Mark, I\u2019m just curious about the impact of FX on both sides of your business and in particularly FX down in Latin American places like Columbia and elsewhere?","Mark Kowlzan","Well, Mark, the strong dollar obviously is impactive to us and that does effects some of our decisions relative to our export business and will impact the margins somewhere as we\u2019ve talked about. But I would say, Mark, that some of the regions of the world that have been more impacted than others where export prices were lowest. We don\u2019t participate in those regions and its even get worst in those regions because of the strong dollars. So you\u2019re very perceptive in that regard.","Mark Wide","Okay. The second question I had just, can you talk about wood cost and wood supply issues in any of your markets where it looks like it might be an issue?","Mark Kowlzan","Yes, Mark, when you look back at 2014 with the wet summer we had in the upper Midwest, the unrelenting rain through the Minnesota Wisconsin area impacted us particularly at Tomahawk through the fall the winter wood build that normally were taking place didn\u2019t occur, so that\u2019s been one particular area that\u2019s wood cost have definitely impacted us. And then the Southeast, the Southern Georgia, the Panhandle region we had a weather call and that impacted the ability to move some wood in so, so that area along with the pellet plant activity again just the ongoing demand on wood basket, but the moisture in the fall definitely impacted some southeast and the upper Midwest.","Mark Wide","[Indiscernible]","Mark Kowlzan","With the better winter conditions now we are just starting to recover and keep better logging conditions.","Mark Wide","Okay and the last question I had Mark was just if you look at these machine conversions that have been done in the containerboard over the last few years it seems like the track record has been pretty chequered [ph]. And I just, I wondered what kind of lessons you guys have learned from doing D3?","Mark Kowlzan","I agree with your comment and I have said before in the last few years you can convert anything, it\u2019s a matter of how much capital you are willing to spend and also the knowledge that they could put into it and we have a unique set of capabilities and we identified the necessary capital to achieve what we needed but we are doing some unique things on a machine that others don\u2019t have the capability to do and\/or choose to spend the money on but part of that again is just our in house expertise and being able to take advantage of a unique situation at DeRidder.","Richard West","And obviously Mark we don\u2019t want to share that technology with competitors, so that\u2019s why we are kind of tight lipped about that. We think we know how to do some neat things and we want to keep it to ourselves.","Mark Wide","Okay, fair enough thanks.","Mark Kowlzan","Okay, with that, Operator, thank you for participating in the call today and we will look forward to talking with you in April. Have a good day, bye bye.","Operator","This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Upon conclusion of his narrative, there will be a Q&A session.","I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kowlzan, and please proceed when you are ready.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning and thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's third quarter 2018 earnings release conference call. I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA. And with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs the Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer.","I'll begin the call with an overview of our third quarter results and then I'm going to turn it over to Tom and Bob, who'll provide further details. And then I'll wrap things up and then we'll be glad to take any questions.","Yesterday, we reported third quarter net income of $207 million, or $2.18 per share. Third quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.05 per share, primarily for certain costs related to discontinuing paper operations associated with the previously announced conversion of the No. 3 machine at our Wallula, Washington mill to linerboard.","Excluding special items, third quarter 2018 net income was $211 million, or $2.23 per share, compared to third quarter 2017 net income of $159 million or $1.68 per share.","Third quarter net sales were $1.8 billion in 2018 and $1.6 billion in 2017. Total company EBITDA for the third quarter, excluding special items, was $406 million in 2018 and $364 million in 2017.","Excluding the special items, third quarter 2018 earnings per share of $2.23 was $0.55 per share above the third quarter of 2017, driven primarily by higher prices in mix of $0.38, and volumes $0.37 in the Packaging segment; higher prices in mix in our Paper segment of $0.13; lower fiber costs $0.04, which was a combination of improved fiber usage and lower OCC prices; and a favorable tax rate of $0.26, primarily resulting from Tax Reform changes.","These items were partially offset by lower volumes in our Paper segment of $0.14, higher operating cost totaling $0.28 per share, and converting costs $0.02. These higher costs were primarily due to inflation-related increases with labor and benefits expenses, repair and material costs, environmental and other professional service costs, equipment and building rental costs, as well as the addition of converting costs related to our Sacramento Container acquisition.","We also had higher freight and logistics expenses of $0.08 per share; annual outage expenses of $0.05; as well as higher depreciation $0.03; and other costs $0.03 per share. Our results were $0.09 above the third quarter guidance of $2.14 per share, primarily due to higher prices in mix in our Packaging and Paper segments, and higher volumes in our Paper segment.","Looking at our Packaging business, EBITDA excluding special items in the third quarter 2018 of $378 million with sales of $1.5 billion resulted in a margin of 25% versus last year's EBITDA of $343 million and sales of $1.3 billion or a 25% margin.","We achieved all-time record containerboard shipments and record third quarter box shipments. Our containerboard mills operated very well, and we successfully executed the scheduled maintenance outage at the Valdosta mill. The newly converted No. 3 machine at our Wallula mill to high performance 100% virgin kraft linerboard continued to meet or exceed expectations throughout the quarter. This now puts us in position to begin optimizing our entire containerboard system platform and improve our manufacturing and freight costs going forward. Also, just as importantly, this allows us to respond quickly and efficiently to future growth and servicing our customers' needs in a timely manner.","We ended the quarter with containerboard inventories about 50,000 tons above the second quarter of 2018 levels and almost 84,000 tons above the third quarter of 2017, primarily due to the addition of the inventory needs of our Sacramento Container acquisition, along with our need to build inventory in certain regions of the country to help mitigate the higher freight and logistics issues that we continue to face.","In addition, higher inventory levels were required to prepare for the fourth quarter extended outage at the Wallula mill to complete the containerboard conversion work that we've spoken about previously as well as preparing for the first quarter 2019 scheduled maintenance outages at our two largest containerboard mills that will significantly reduce our production early next year.","I'm now going to turn it over to Tom who'll provide more details on the containerboard sales and corrugated business.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Thanks, Mark. As Mark indicated, we achieved a new all-time record for containerboard shipments with continued strong demand in our box plants as well as our domestic and export containerboard markets. We also had record third quarter corrugated product shipments which were up 8.2% in total with one additional workday and shipments per day up 6.5% over last year's third quarter.","Our outside sales volume of containerboard was 20,000 tons above last year's third quarter and 35,000 tons higher than the second quarter of 2018. We continued to implement our Packaging segment price increases very well during the quarter. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.31 per share above the third quarter of 2017 and up $0.19 per share compared to the second quarter of 2018.","Export containerboard prices were up $0.07 per share, compared to the third quarter of 2017 and flat compared to the second quarter of 2018. We expect corrugated products demand to remain strong as we move into the fourth quarter, although we expect shipments to be lower compared to the third quarter with two less shipping days.","Also, beginning in the fourth quarter, year-over-year volume comparisons will now include Sacramento Container in both periods. Our corrugated products mix will be seasonally less rich in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter as the produce business in the Pacific Northwest as well as the display and high-end graphics business for the holiday period normally falls off during the quarter.","I'll now turn it back to Mark.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Thanks, Tom. Looking at the Paper segment, EBITDA excluding special items in the third quarter was $44 million with sales of $254 million or 17% margin, compared to the third quarter of 2017's EBITDA of $38 million and sales of $271 million or 14% margin.","Strong market conditions continued during the quarter and our prices and mix were slightly better than we anticipated. Volume for our cut-size and printing and converting products continued to be on allocation as we managed our already tight inventory levels around the scheduled outage at the Jackson mill.","I'm now going to turn it over to Bob.","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","Thanks, Mark. We had very good free cash flow generation in the third quarter, with cash provided by operations of $301 million. The primary uses of cash during the quarter included: capital expenditures of $130 million; common stock dividends, which reflect our recent 25% dividend increase, totaled $75 million; $51 million for federal and state income tax payments; pension payments of $18 million; and interest payments of $7 million. We ended the quarter with $294 million of cash on hand. The 2018 tax estimate ranges continue to be 14%, 16% for our federal and state cash tax rate, and 24% to 26% for our book effective tax rate.","I'll now turn it back over to Mark.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Thanks, Bob. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect Packaging segment demand to remain strong, although as Tom mentioned, we will have two less shipping days, and we expect a seasonally less rich mix in corrugated products compared to the third quarter. In our Paper segment, we will continue implementing our recently announced price increases, but expect a seasonally less rich mix.","Although paper volumes will be seasonally lower, we expect demand to remain strong as we manage our already tight inventory levels. With seasonally colder weather, fuel costs are expected to be higher across the company and we expect continued inflation in most of our operating and converting costs, including incremental wage pressure with the tighter labor market. We will also have an extended outage at the Wallula mill to complete the remaining work related to the conversion of the No. 3 machine from paper to linerboard. Considering these items, we expect fourth quarter earnings of $2.15 per share.","And with that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. The statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in the Annual Report on Form 10-K and on file with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements.","With that, Heidi, I'd like to open up the call to questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Your first question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes and good morning, everyone.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning, Chip.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Mark, we saw a really big jump in exports in the third quarter according to the industry data. I know September was the biggest month we ever saw and it would be one thing if there was obvious softness in the economy, but we saw the industry really stretch for these operating rates to, I guess, supply that. I didn't know if you could explain to us what made the export market so appealing, at least that's what apparently was the case given the strong numbers.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Well, I think, in our case, we typically see when we come out of the first part of the year, because of the annual outages, we're limited on how much ability we have to service our long-term legacy customers around the world. And so, in that case, as we've done in the past coming into the third quarter, the mills are running and the shutdowns are behind us. And so, we're able to now pick up and service the export order. So, that was certainly the case for us. We had the ability. The mills are running well and we have the demand from these legacy customers.","Tom, do you want to add to that?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","I would just add that at least from PCA's point of view, I mean we're a little more back-loaded in the year for our exports. But in addition, demand was very good worldwide.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yeah, okay. That's helpful. And just a second question, a lot of us on this call pretend to know what to do in the market. Your experience has been terrific, noting that you last bought back a lot of stock in late 2015 and 2016. I think at, we just calculated, an average price of $57. And so for that, I would congratulate you for not buying back the stock earlier this year like probably everyone was telling you to. With the situation having changed a lot, is that something that you're taking a deeper look at? I mean, you could consider that your after tax cost of a dividend is probably now more than the after tax cost of borrowing money?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","I think what we've always said publicly is that we will always be opportunistic. That's been the keyword we've always used in our decision-making on how we decide and when to buy back stock. Also any discussion is a board level discussion. And so all things being considered, we like to remain in a position with a lot of flexibility, strong balance sheet, cash on hand and just being able to take advantage of whatever opportunity presents itself, whether it's share buyback, dividend increases, or acquisitions or capital opportunities. So, I guess that being said, we certainly have opportunities. But, again, that's a matter for the board level.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. I'll turn it over. I might get back in. Thanks, guys.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Okay. Thanks, Chip. Next question, please.","Operator","From the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Ashish Gupta - Stephens, Inc.","Hi, good morning. This is Ashish Gupta for Mark.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Morning.","Ashish Gupta - Stephens, Inc.","Morning. Based on what we calculated in terms of your cost per ton in containerboard, we're just kind of wondering how you were able to get the cost per ton down. It was very impressive performance, just surprising given the inflation we're seeing. Is there something structural in the mills? Is there more tailwinds that we can expect in the future? Just if you could give us more color on that that'd be great.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","No, I think it's a testament to the high efficiency operations, the focus we have day to day. We've said this for years and years that the daily focus in the mills is on operating cost and operating efficiency. Box plants, it's all about profitable volume and we watch our costs obviously. But the mills, seven days a week, 24 hours a day, it's about high efficiency, low-cost operation. So, we have a very large team of engineers full time working in the mills and in a large corporate technology organization that's dedicated to that very effort.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Great. And if you just allow me one more. Can you give us an idea of what the split is between commodity and specialty paper? It just seemed like there was a much higher price realization in the quarter in white paper. I just wasn't sure if that had to do with the premium versus commodity split.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","I don't have that number on the top of my head. That's something we don't pay particular attention to in terms of that level. We can always get back with you on that one.","Ashish Gupta - Stephens, Inc.","No problem. Thanks so much.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","All right. Next question, please.","Operator","Certainly. From the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, Mark. Good morning, Tom, Bob.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I wondered, is it possible to get some sense of sort of same store box volumes if we didn't have Sacramento in the mix?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Tom?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. Yeah. Mark, I think the best indicator is probably where we are so far this month because we're \u2013 so, I'll just share those numbers with you. We're averaging a little over 2.5% so far this month and that's everything baked in. So you got a complete apples-to-apples comparison there.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. That's helpful. And then just kind of following on that, it seems like given the growth in your box volumes over the last couple of years and assuming some kind of momentum into next year, you're going to actually have offset all of that Wallula capacity by sometime late next year, early 2020, and you'll be pretty close to fully integrated. So, I just \u2013 I wonder what kind of options you might be considering if we look out a couple of years here in terms of containerboard supply.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Well, Mark, we've said this before, we always have opportunities whether it's internal, how we look at the assets we operate, but we certainly have the opportunity into and through next year to fully take advantage of the Wallula capacity. We certainly have to finish the work we're doing right now. The machine is scheduled to start back up early next week from its planned outage this month. And so if we've done our homework and executed well, we should be in a great position to take advantage of the productivity opportunities at Wallula.","That being said, I think you're right, if you assume that growth continues on this trajectory, we'd be looking out in the future years at various alternatives. And that's \u2013 again, we've said that it would include further conversions, asset acquisitions in terms of one-off mill opportunities. So, we've got a host of opportunities, but I'm certainly not concerned about that at this point.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. All right. I \u2013 just one quick one. Is there any \u2013 is there a chance to get a view on 2019 CapEx, Bob Mundy?","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","No, Mark. We'll talk about that on the next call as we normally do.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. That's fine. I'll turn it over. Thanks.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Certainly. From the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details so far. I wanted to check into the price mix result in the third quarter relative to your guidance. If you could talk a little bit to the extent possible about what materialized better than you were initially guiding to in the quarter? And I had a couple of follow-ons.","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","Well, there were a couple of things, George. On the Paper side, we had some favorability there. And of course on the box side, that was a little bit improved versus what we're anticipating. It just goes back to always trying to maximize the benefit of the products that we have available and the brands that we can offer.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Bob, if I could, the mix was a little bit richer than you expected or anything else that you could share again realizing it's not something you initially want to advertise live mic, but anything else you could share in term of what realized a little bit more favorably than you'd expected?","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","No, it was \u2013 certainly it's a mix, George. But it's also just very good execution on the box plant side, on the corrugated side of things that was certainly a piece of that as well.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. I appreciate the commentary there. Mark, with Wallula, what are kind of the key milestones over the quarter, I mean, to the extent that we can check in or what we should be asking about on the next call? What would they be in terms of the last bit of work being done successfully?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Well, just to remind everybody, during the May outage, we converted the machine from a coated paper machine to a virgin kraft linerboard machine. But we are running in a slowed back capacity while we're waiting on our final permits to be issued for air permits. And so running to that permit level as we called out, we are running in that 700 tons to 800 tons a day range. Now, we have the permits in hand, and so it allows us to run the productivity up to the planned 1,150-ton a day or about 400,000 tons a year annual run rate. Now, that's assuming, as I said a few minutes ago, that we've done our homework well and the folks out there are executing well. This work we're doing currently involves the new shoe press installation, rebuilding out the forming unit, adding the final dryer section that we were waiting on, and then pulp mill changes.","So, we have a host of different things that we're doing. But I've got confidence in the group to execute. We should be starting up next week, and so I think in January you should be hearing us talk about how we came up and ran. On the July call I mentioned that when we started up on the first week of June, within the first two hours, we were selling premium high-performance virgin kraft linerboard within two hours. And so that's going to be \u2013 the key is making sure that we come up and run as planned and then basically supply our needs as we go through the fourth quarter and prepare for next year. And then I've said this on the call a little while ago, too, that this gives us the opportunity to rebalance out our supply system in terms of how we're supplying linerboard throughout North America to our mill system...","(22:09)","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, Mark \u2013 sorry about that. Last one for me, and I'll turn it over. Obviously, conversions and increase in capacity in North America have been very topical in the trade press and certainly everyone has a view on that and its effect for the market. Has your view on the implications of this capacity changed at all? Why or why not? What would you sort of remind us about as we're trying to analyze the industry relative to this capacity and the implication again for the future? Thanks, guys. Good luck in the quarter.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. George, if you look at it from our perspective, if you go back in when we announced Wallula almost two years ago, that was purely based on our internal demand as we saw our needs growing through the future period of time. The majority of the other announcements, if you go back and look again over this period of time and through this year, the majority of these announcements are based on these integrated players internal demand for this product. And so there is very little that has been talked about that would flow to the very limited outside open market. Tom, you want to add to that?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah, I think Mark hit the key point there, George and that is that, as you mentioned, given the demand that we have right now in the industry and you just look at the run rates, we're going to need additional capacity in this market. Now, that said, most of the additions that have been either executed or on the drawing board are integrated suppliers, and they've got a home for those tons, obviously. When we went through this before, not that long ago in the industry, there was a lot of consternation about it. And it turned out that the industry did absorb this tonnage, and that most of the suppliers, certainly ourselves, I mean, we run to demand, and that's what we'll continue to do.","But if you look at a number of other things that are going on as well, we've talked in the last couple of calls about the situation in China, the fact that they absolutely need fiber. I think the Nine Dragons move into the United States as well as a couple of others demonstrates that in spades. They're talking about shipping pulp back. They're talking about shipping a limited amount of containerboard back with what they can convert. It's expensive to do. But given the situation over there, they need fiber, and so that's all going over to China as we see it.","Mark also mentioned the limited open market that we have here. I mean, the dynamics in this industry has changed dramatically, as we've talked about, and said that integrated producers are generally somewhere around 90% of the demand. And so you've got a very, very limited open market to sell to. If somebody doesn't have a customer, they're probably going to have to look overseas for that.","In addition, some of the other things that we've seen announced, maybe the one-offs, tend to be recycled or maybe it's a virgin, but it's not the best virgin. It's very high cost. And a lot of these conversions are not in very good wood baskets. And they're also limited to lightweights and super lightweights which again is a limited market. So, overall, I think that we don't have tremendous concerns about this because we know what the demand is on the conversion side. And that tells us, I mean, on the box side I'm talking about, and that translates into some need for new capacity.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thank you, guys.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","All right. Next question, please.","Operator","Certainly. From the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning, Anthony.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Just two question. It didn't seem like you had any direct impacts from the hurricanes. I'm just wondering if there were any kind of secondary impacts either on demand or maybe higher fiber costs or supply chain costs in the Southeast. And then just generally, you talked about continued inflation in most of your categories into 4Q. I was wondering if you could talk specifically about freight. Are you seeing any maybe just stabilization year-over-year in terms of freight rates, any kind of color you could give there?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. The first part of the question regarding the hurricane impact, we saw minimal impact from Hurricane Florence in the Carolina region. Basically it was around transportation impacts for that couple of weeks, just slowing things down on finished goods outflow and raw material inflow; again, some of our having the impact. Tom, you want to talk a little bit more about that because, otherwise, the latest hurricane that went through the Panhandle had no impact on us.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. We didn't have any impact on our facilities, but certainly some of our customers did have some impacts. And so that will, on a short-term, impact some of the demand in those particular markets and also a little impact in the ag area as well.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","And then regarding inflation, Bob, why don't you...","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. So, just a couple \u2013 on storms, not so much hurricanes, Anthony, but we did have a sort of an odd storm that came through one of our large modern Chicago container plants. And it hit us for a couple of pennies in our third quarter results with the damage and so forth that occurred there. But they're not hurricanes, but it was certainly storm-related.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","That was a July storm, Anthony.","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","And then on freight, freight is we talked about our inventory, manage our inventories and doing what we had to do to help mitigate some of those freight and logistics costs. I think that's what we're seeing is that we held that in a good place during the third quarter and we anticipate doing that again in the fourth quarter. Other than that, there were other operating costs and what have you, including labor and fringes and so forth. We'd still see that again creeping up again as we move into the fourth quarter.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, that's very helpful. And then just following up on the last question, I guess industry exports have gone up in the last couple of months. Your outside sales of paper are up. Do you export meaningful amounts of board to China? And then with customers or traders in China, are you seeing an increase in demand, given the very strict import restrictions that they've put in place on recycled paper?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","We export to about 35 different countries all around the world, very small amounts relatively speaking. China happens to be one of those outlets that we have, again, some very good legacy customers. And so we did supply a very minimal amount of extra tons during this quarter. But it was a minimal amount of incremental tons that flowed to China. But we did see some extra demand to these legacy customers.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Next question, please.","Operator","Certainly. From the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","My first one is, I wanted to ask about volumes kind of through the year if you've seen any notable trends or differences. And what you think is really driving the growth for PKG ahead of the market beyond Sacramento Container going forward?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","I'll start out and then I'll turn it over to Tom. I think again, in general, what you see is we have a very strong manufacturing activity nationwide. That has continued to show a positive impact across many different sectors. And then , the ag business in various regions, Tom, do you want to give a little more detailed color?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. Debbie, I would say that our volumes have continued to track up throughout the year. We're bullish on that. I would say that the only thing that interrupts that at all at any point in time is inventory adjustments that our customers go through. And those are just cyclical, to some extent. But no sooner do those adjustments take place that the demand ramps right back up again. So when you look at it across the year, I mean, it's a steady improvement.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. My second question is, on inventories moving higher, there's cost associated with that. Obviously, you're trying to offset some other headwinds. I'm wondering if there's ever any discussion about investing in your own fleet or anything like that as you think about the idea that transport headwinds are probably here to stay, costs are going to potentially go higher in 2019?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. Debbie, we've mentioned before on earnings calls earlier this year that we've been certainly taking advantage through some of our acquisitions. The TimBar acquisition, Sacramento Container, Columbus, and then the Boise Cascade system had its own transportation organization. And so we have certainly bolstered that capability. We've been investing over the last year-and-a-half in rolling stock and drivers. And so we have certainly been growing that nationwide capability to service more of our regional activity. So that's certainly been a factor in helping us with our efficiencies.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. I'll turn it over.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Next question, please.","Operator","Certainly. From the line of Mark Weintraub with Seaport Global. Please go ahead.","Mark Weintraub - Seaport Global Holdings LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning, Mark.","Mark Weintraub - Seaport Global Holdings LLC","I was hoping to get if possible more color on Wallula and how much of the profit potential we might already have been seeing and\/or will have seen in the second half of this year versus what it can be when it's fully ramped? Because I realize there are a lot of moving parts here.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. We've never called out the specific contributions we expected from the Wallula conversion. Obviously, people have been modeling that. We did say that it had a positive contribution after it started up in terms of the \u2013 that's one of the reasons our numbers in the second quarter were a little bit better. And then I'll put it this way, we're very pleased with the contribution that we saw through the third quarter, but again, we're not going to quantify that.","Bob, you want to add a little color to that?","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","Obviously, we said earlier in the year that it would be a lumpy year for that conversion and what it was doing to our results. There certainly was a hit in the second quarter of about $0.05 sequentially, but then we had a nice pickup in the third. But again, going from the third to the fourth, they'll be on a $0.07 or $0.08 hit to do all the work that we have to do in the fourth quarter. So, but once we come out of that, then we'll see \u2013 I think we're going to hit our expectations as far as the profit improvement in the Packaging segment but also to mitigate what we were seeing in the pressure sensitive business as decline in margins which is why we took advantage of that machine the way we did.","Mark Weintraub - Seaport Global Holdings LLC","So, if I understand correctly, so it's something of a hit in the second quarter and then nice contribution third, and then at least some of it coming back in the fourth. So if we net all that together in 2018, would it be a positive, negative or kind of neutral-ish?","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","It'd be a slight negative.","Mark Weintraub - Seaport Global Holdings LLC","Okay. So is it fair to say all the goods really on a net basis to come in 2019? Making sure that I understand.","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","Yes, that's correct.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Yes.","Mark Weintraub - Seaport Global Holdings LLC","Great. Okay. Super. That's it. Thank you.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Okay. Next question, please.","Operator","Certainly. From the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Morning.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Morning.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Morning.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Mark, when I look at the \u2013 historically looking back at Wallula and some of the time to convert that mill, a lot of it was around equipment backlogs and just waiting for some of the new equipment from your suppliers to come in. And I'm just thinking about on a go-forward basis as you look to maybe upgrade some of your other capacity, what are you seeing as far as equipment backlog is just with all the conversions taking place in the industry right now? Has that lengthened material or something you're concerned about on a go-forward basis?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Yes, let's make it clear that we're not considering anything right now on a going-forward basis as far as conversion. But it is public knowledge in terms of some of the major equipment deliveries that head boxes, dryer cans, refiners, press sections. You're talking about 18 to 20 month deliveries for critical pieces of equipment from the vendors around the world. So that's moved out even further than it had been a year ago.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And when you look at your fiber sourcing that we've heard from a few other producers around increased wood fiber costs following the hurricanes. Is that something that you've seen as well?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","We have not been impacted directly because of the Carolina, Florence Hurricane or the Panhandle event. Again, our mill, Valdosta in particular and Jackson mill were out of the way. And so we've really not seen any impact in terms of deliveries or gate wood (36:32) pricing. Going forward, obviously theoretically, we would anticipate that there's a lot of pine that will be on the market as landowners have to harvest wood before it becomes non-usable in pulp and paper and lumber. So there could be an opportunity for some \u2013 in terms of an availability in some of these regions that were impacted by the hurricane. But, again, we're not seeing anything significant.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Last one for me is just on the export market. I mean you mentioned strong shipments into the export market and obviously you've got 30-plus countries, but anything you're seeing on pricing in the export market just given it seems like growth outside of the U.S. is maybe slowing a little bit. Anything you can give us there would be helpful. Thanks.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Scott, this is Tom. The only impact we really see in the export market is around tariffs and currency exchange. So, those are the primary factors going on right now. As I mentioned earlier, the prices are flat compared to last quarter.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Tom. Thanks, Mark.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Certainly. From the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning, Brian.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","I just wanted to come back to demand maybe from a little bit of a different angle, but a lot of concern in the market these days just around macro and sort of where the forward demand outlook is. And some of the industry data in September was a little bit lighter than the trend that had been on. I just wondered if you could comment if you saw that as well. I think you talked about maybe periodic customer inventory adjustments being made, not sure if you saw that sort of in the middle of September like some of the trade periodicals reported. And just as you're looking into October, can you just clarify on that 2.5% number? Was that at an absolute basis or on a per day basis? Thanks.","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Okay. Brian, this is Tom. The September numbers were a little lighter you said than the trend. In any given month, it's hard to estimate what really the trend is. You've got to look over a longer period of time. And so we see the trend is remaining pretty good.","The number I'm talking about for the month of October is essentially where we are right now. We're still having a difficult time getting all the data out of Sacramento. They're not on our systems and that sort of stuff. So, I'm trying to blend Sacramento into what our current plans are, and that's where we're running right now.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks. And earlier, Mark, you talked about different options for cash, the buybacks. Obviously, one M&A in the past you've been active, but not so much in Sacramento. Just wondering, in the current environment, how much of a focus is M&A? And if there are conversations still going on there? Are you seeing any signs? Some of the asking prices at multiples might be coming down to reflect sort of what's going on in the public equity markets here?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","No. Again, we'll continue to be opportunistic and look at one-off box plant businesses that would make sense for us. As far as multiples dropping, again, they're still \u2013 and if it's a high quality book of business, there's still a big demand for that out in the marketplace. So, I'm not seeing a big change in that. Tom, do you want to go ahead and add a little color to that?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","I would say that's what's dropping is the availability of good businesses. As I mentioned earlier, I mean, the independent market has reduced so dramatically that do you know that there are much, much fewer options. I also would just mention that we did close on a small acquisition. It's \u2013 that's not \u2013 that we're not going to discuss. But it's just a small one that we just completed. More strategic in nature, but those are some of the things we'll continue to do.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. I appreciate the color. Thanks.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Next question, please.","Operator","Certainly. From the line of Steve Chercover with Davidson. Please go ahead.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Thanks, and good morning, everyone.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Good morning.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","I just have two quick ones. So, first of all, I guess to follow on Chip's question, can you just remind us please what your repo authorization might be at this stage?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. I know it's $193 million, I believe. Bob?","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. Yeah.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","That's the number.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","$193 million dry powder? Okay. And then, secondly, I appreciate your perspective on the industry changes and the ability to absorb any new capacity. But assuming your system's virtually sold out a couple of years from now, can you give us a sense geographically where would be most advantageous to add given your box system in the freight environment?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Again, I don't want to speculate, and I don't want to get into \u2013 it's very proprietary at a minimum. And so that's something we're not going to discuss.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","All right. Thank you.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Next question, please.","Operator","From the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Morning.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Tom, just one clarification back to the box demands. You're up 6.5% in 3Q including Sacramento. And then I think you said in October, you're up 2.5% exclusive of Sacramento. Should we assume the entire delta between the 6.5% in 3Q and the 2.5% in October, at least thus far, was the impact of Sacramento, or was there anything else going on there?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Well, I don't think you can assume that in general, no. I think there is a lot of moving parts to our business. There's a lot of timing associated with when we're busier and when we're not busier. And the third quarter is a very strong quarter for us. Fourth quarter, we've got two less selling days, and we really don't know in any given fourth quarter. It's just hard to predict exactly what the volume is going to be. So this is just a very small snapshot of what the start to October is.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Sure. No, thank you. And just one follow up to something you were talking about earlier with the capacity coming from the integrateds versus non-integrateds and talked about the small open market that exists. That the market's 90% integrateds. The idea being that given how small the open market is, that would perhaps prevent market entrants, but obviously, we've seen Nine Dragons as well as Midwest, Verso, McKinley, all of which are non-integrated announced capacity into what is a very small open market. So, any thoughts as to where all that paper would go given how small you talked about the open market being?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","But that's the point. Also you mentioned McKinley but they are, in fact, integrated into Mexico. But that's the point that Tom has made, and we've been talking about that. It's such a limited opportunity. Some of the Chinese activity that they have clearly called out that they will be moving that fiber back to China. And so if you have somebody that's going to try to produce a product in this country, they are very constrained within a geographic region, transportation cost phenomena, and then just the market opportunity. Tom?","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. I would also add, Adam, that we've already seen some demonstration of what's happening in the marketplace and we're seeing most of this paper trying to find a home in export markets, which is also somewhat difficult to do. I mean, export primarily focuses on virgin as opposed to recycled. And then, it's got to be a pretty good virgin sheet in order to enter into somebody's system, otherwise, it needs to move into the Middle East or something like that. And we're already seeing some of that. So, we're already getting the answers to what happens if you put in mill capacity and you don't have an integrated outlet for it.","The other thing is, I think everybody needs to keep in mind that just because something was announced and this is to take place two, three years from now, depending on demand, depending on markets, everything else, that may or may not ever take place because these are huge, huge capital investments that have a high expectation for return. And if those returns aren't there, given the fact they may not have an outlet, that may never occur.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","All right. Next question, please.","Operator","And we have a follow-up from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes. Tom and Mark, just had a question about any thoughts you had about demand more longer term. I know we've talked a lot about what the third and the fourth quarter is. But you notice that Amazon, despite its size, has doubled its fulfilment square footage in the last 30 months, which is about half the size of Manhattan, but fortunately, it's all flat.","But when you look at that kind of investment that the market seems to think as it make sense, you would think that e-commerce alone could be adding quite a bit to demand. And as you all know from what we saw before the outsourcing days, we would typically see box demand mirror GDP all the way through till the year 2000. And now we're past outsourcing, but back then, we didn't have e-commerce. So, how do you think about the impact at e-commerce as you look out the next three years?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Well, e-commerce is much, much bigger than just Amazon. Many of our customers would be approximately 18,000 or 19,000 customers. Many of our customers utilize e-commerce to move their finished product out to their customer base. It just so happens that Amazon obviously is the big player in the United States, and so it captures a lot of the attention. That being said, it's certainly been a growth factor, e-commerce in general and Amazon. And so, again, it presents an opportunity for the industry on growth going forward.","And, Tom, you want to add some comments? You spoke...","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. I would say, Chip, that, I mean, it is amazing the growth rate that Amazon has. There's no question about that. It is absolutely amazing they're at the rate they are growing. But in addition, I think the other good news is that big box isn't dead either. And so brick and mortar is readjusting, and they're actually growing. So, I think that really bodes well for consumer spending and equally bodes well for our box business.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thanks. That's helpful.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Any other questions, please?","Operator","Certainly. We have a question from the line of Gabriel Hajde with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, gentlemen. Just two quick ones. The $0.14 decline in the Paper business from lower volumes, is there something seasonal were stronger in the third quarter, or is that something that we can kind of extrapolate out over the next couple of quarters as you flip to containerboard?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","No. That was related to exiting the pressure-sensitive business that we talked about during the year.","Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So, nothing to do with the Wallula mill?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Well, it was the Wallula business. And again, that's \u2013 we talked about that when we announced the project prior to this year and we've spoken about that in January and April and July in terms of the quarter-to-quarter impact as we were unwinding that business through the summer months and through the remaining portion of this fourth quarter. We're selling out the rest of the inventory we had on hand. So it's just a declining volume that happens to be in the Paper segment.","Robert P. Mundy - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. In addition to the tight conditions that Mark spoke of earlier when we're on allocation and inventories are extremely low, so we're just having to really watch what we can sell right now to properly manage our inventories for the future which also had a downward push on volumes.","Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And I think you addressed it a little bit before, Bob, in a previous question, the 50,000 ton inventory build, and then what you're planning to do taking a little bit down again this quarter to complete your work. Depending on, I guess, how demand shakes out, would you anticipate that inventories would be up at the end of the year versus the third quarter or flat? And then, you mentioned Q1 being a heavy maintenance year. I think this year was pretty large as well. Would you envision it being bigger than Q1 of 2018? Or any sense for that?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","This is Mark. Let me answer the inventory. We'd anticipate that year-end inventories for 2018 would be similar to year-end inventories for 2017. And then regarding the second part of your question, we will call out specifically during the January call what the annual shutdown impact will be in terms of costs for the year.","Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Thank you. Next question?","Operator","And we have a follow-up from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead, sir.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thank you. Two quick ones for me, guys. Thanks for taking my call. First of all, piggybacking on Chip's question, does the growth of e-commerce and the packaging required for that have any implications for the sheet of paper? So, might we see more light weights with e-commerce or not necessarily? Question one.","Question two. Flexibility has always been something that PKG tries to manage across its system, across its converting network. With recovered paper prices being as low as they are, does that suggest perhaps you'd be a little bit more open to having more recycled content, more OCC in your mix or whatever RCP in the future? Thanks, guys. Good luck in the quarter again.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. Second part of the question. We anticipate that OCC as a fiber supply to the world will establish a new equilibrium over time. The world still needs essentially the same amount of fiber at the beginning of the year, and China still requires the most fiber of any country. They still consume more total cellulosic fiber than anybody in the world. And so we would anticipate longer term that OCC continues to be volatile, and we would rather not be tied to that in any significant manner, but we would obviously remain flexible and opportunistic in how we're able to utilize it.","The first part of your question, Tom, do you want to...","Thomas A. Hassfurther - Packaging Corp. of America","Yeah. I would say that the growth in e-commerce, I mean, does not necessarily dictate more light weights. I mean, it could be \u2013 it's a mixed bag as well depending on the size of the box, depending on the performance that somebody is looking for, etcetera. So, I think if there's any change, it's minimal.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","Thank you. Any other questions, please?","Operator","No, Mr. Kowlzan. I see there are no more questions. Do you have any closing comments?","Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of America","I just want to thank everybody for joining us on the call.

Your host today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chief Executive Officer of PCA. Upon conclusion of his narrative, there will be a question-and-answer session.","I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kowlzan, and please proceed when you're ready.","Mark Kowlzan","Thank you, and good morning and thanks for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's first quarter 2016 earnings release conference call. I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA; and with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs our Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer.","During our prepared comments, we will be referring to slides that are posted on the website. I'll begin the call with an overview of our first quarter results, and then I'll turn the call over to Tom and Bob, who will provide further details regarding the first quarter. I'll wrap things up, and then we'll be glad to take questions.","Yesterday, we reported record first quarter net income of $104 million or $1.09 per share. First quarter net income included special charges for facilities closure cost of $1.9 million. Excluding these special items, first quarter 2016 net income was $106 million or a record $1.11 per share compared to the first quarter 2015 net income of $100 million or $1.01 per share.","First quarter net sales were $1.4 billion in both 2016 and 2015. Total company EBITDA, excluding special items, was $272 million for the quarter compared to $255 million in last year's first quarter. Details of special items for the quarter were included in the schedule that accompanied our earnings press release.","Turning to Slide 3. First quarter 2016 earnings per share, excluding special items, were $0.10 per share above the first quarter of 2015, driven primarily by higher containerboard and corrugated products volume of $0.03, lower annual mill outage costs $0.08, lower cost for fiber $0.06, energy $0.6, and freight $0.04 as well as a lower share count of $0.04 that resulted from the share repurchases.","These items were partially offset by lower white paper prices and mix of $0.04, lower containerboard export prices $0.03, lower domestic containerboard and corrugated prices and mix $0.03, lower pulp volume $0.02, higher labor cost $0.01, higher depreciation $0.03, higher interest expense $0.02, and the state incentive that was received in 2015 related to the investment shift at DeRidder mill of $0.02.","Our earnings were $0.11 per share above our first quarter guidance of $1 per share. This was primarily the result of three things. First, we have, what I term, best-ever operational performance aided somewhat by milder than expected winter weather, which in total contributed $0.07 per share. Secondly, we had synergy related benefits from the optimization of freight logistics costs of $0.02. And third, we have lower share count, which contributed $0.02 per share.","Looking at our packaging business, EBITDA excluding special items and margins, were up over last year's levels with EBITDA of $235 million and sales of $1.1 billion or 21.4% margin compared to the first quarter 2015 packaging EBITDA of $222 million on sales of $1.1 billion or 20.2% margin.","We successfully completed scheduled maintenance outages at our Valdosta, Georgia; DeRidder, Louisiana; and Counce, Tennessee mills, and containerboard production with 897,000 tons, which was 15,000 tons of increase compared to the first quarter of 2015. We ran our mill system to demand, and with the D3 machine at DeRidder now at full capacity, we were able to support first quarter maintenance outages rather than prebuilding inventory during the fourth quarter of 2015. Our corrugated product shipments were solid against a very strong first quarter of 2015 and containerboard inventories ended flat with last quarter and the first quarter of 2015.","I'll now turn it over to Tom, who'll provide more details on containerboard sales and our corrugating business.","Thomas Hassfurther","Thank you, Mark. As Mark indicated, our corrugated product shipments were very good, up 3.4%, with one more work day were 1.7% per work day compared to a strong first quarter of 2015. As a comparison, the industry was up 1.4% in total, and flat on a work day basis. Our outside sales of containerboard were flat versus last year's first quarter and down about 4,000 tons versus the fourth quarter.","For both comparative periods, domestic volumes were higher and export volumes were lower. Export prices were about 7% below first quarter 2015 levels or $0.03 per share and about 1% lower than the fourth quarter. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.03 per share below the first quarter of 2015 and $0.01 lower than the fourth quarter.","I will now turn it back to Mark.","Mark Kowlzan","Thanks, Tom. Looking at our paper segment, EBITDA excluding special items, was a first quarter record $51 million on sales of $281 million or an 18.2% margin compared to the first quarter of 2015 EBITDA of $49 million and sales of $297 million or 16.6% margin.","Our office paper shipments, which represent about 70% of our white paper volume, were up versus the first quarter of 2015. And overall white paper shipments were flat with last year's first quarter, while pulp shipments were lower. White paper sales volume was flat with the first quarter of 2015, while our price and mix were lower.","Sales volume and mix were favorable compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, while prices were slightly lower. All the mills ran exceptionally well during the quarter with very good cost.","To put this quarter into results perspective, the $51 million of EBITDA is the highest first quarter and second highest of any quarter over the last five years. The highest was the seasonally strong third quarter of 2014, when the average white paper price was $95 per ton higher than this year's first quarter. The 18.2% EBITDA margin is an all-time best for our paper business.","Finally, we notified customers of paper price increases of $60 per ton effective April 5, for our printing and converting grade; and $60 per ton effective May 2, for our office paper grades.","I'll now turn it over to Bob Mundy.","Robert Mundy","Thanks, Mark. If you look at Slide 4, we have very strong free cash flow generation in the first quarter, with cash provided by operations of $191 million, capital expenditures of $53 million, which resulted in free cash flow of $138 million. During the quarter, we paid common stock dividends totaling $53 million; repurchased just under 2 million shares, totaling $100 million or about $50.49 per share; and we had a $2 million scheduled term-loan repayment.","We completed our $150 million stock repurchase program that was authorized in July 2015, and received authorization from our Board for a new $200 million repurchase program. We ended the quarter with $162 million of cash on hand. Finally, our scheduled maintenance outage cost came in about where we expected, and our quarterly estimates for the balance of the year are unchanged from the guidance we gave you on our last call.","Now, I'll turn it back to Mark.","Mark Kowlzan","Thank you Bob. Looking ahead to the second quarter compared to the first quarter, we expect seasonally higher containerboard and corrugated product shipments, white paper prices should begin to improve late in the second quarter, as a result of our paper price increases, but the vast majority of any price increase will not be realized until the third quarter. We also expect some seasonal improvement in our energy costs, as we move into warmer weather. And our share count will be lower due to our repurchases in the first quarter.","Prices for containerboard and corrugated products are expected to be slightly lower, as a result of the published price decreases. Our annual maintenance outage costs will be about $0.08 per share higher, as we have four scheduled mill outages compared to three in the first quarter. Everything considered, we currently expect second quarter earnings of $1.18 per share.","With that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. These statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.","With that, operator, I would like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.","Mark Weintraub","I was trying to understand the $0.07 from the best-ever operational performance and the $0.02 from the freight and logistics relative to what you're expectations had been. Did a lot of that show up in the paper business particularly? And relatedly, if we think about what's driving that, what's been driving it, if we look at the improvement you had from fiber, energy, freight, were those the major component drivers? And if so, how much of that was just because fiber and energy costs were lower than expected for the commodity versus a function of being more efficient in the usage of those inputs?","Mark Kowlzan","As far as the upsize that you referred to, it was spread out. I mean, all eight mills performed exceptionally well. As I said, it was a truly best-ever operational efficiency across the board. The white paper mill, I-Falls, Jackson, Wallula also significantly contributed to this upside. So we're very pleased with the three months work. It wasn't just one month, but we saw consistent contribution from the operational effectiveness out of the white paper mill. So it was a nice contribution from that side of the business.","But just to remind you, Mark, that that didn't just happen because of any activity necessarily that just took place now. But when we were involved over the last two-and-a-half year primarily with DeRidder, we continued to make enormous improvements in the infrastructure and operational capabilities in these white mills.","And so when the integration was concluding last year, primarily the work at DeRidder was winding up midyear last year. We were able to move more resource into these white mills and putting a much stronger focus day-to-day in bringing this capability there. So again that number was between the mills, but again a very good contribution came from the white mills.","And the question regarding transportation, Bob, do you want to fill in some of that?","Robert Mundy","The transportation was pretty much across the white mills as well as on the packaging sides, the mill and the box plants. So a lot of work was done there to optimize the freight and logistics, and we'll continue to see the improvements of those efforts.","Mark Weintraub","So, if I understand rightly, then having gotten DeRidder behind you, part of what we're seeing is the ability to focus your resources at some of the other mills and so that will walk forward improvements more rapidly, is that a fair understanding of what you just said?","Mark Kowlzan","I think, if you go back over the last two years in particular, although we had the bulk of the spending and the effort at DeRidder, because again that was the important factor in the integration, we nevertheless were continuing to improve the great deal of the infrastructure within the white paper mill. And so just as I had called out that we worked on over 400 discrete projects at DeRidder last year alone, we worked on hundreds and hundreds of small projects at the three white paper mills. A lot of them did require a lot of capital. They were changing the way we do things, both on technology, working on the process, process control.","And so it's all been a cumulative benefit that's come to light. A one good example, Mark, on the white paper side, we called out last year the new turbine generator that was being started up at I Falls in September, that was one big example of a $20 million capital spend. We tried that the turbine, we spent less than $10 million on the Jackson recovery boiler bottom. But those couple of items, in particular really helped those two mills really rebalance their capabilities.","An example at I Falls of that turbine was a 52 megawatt turbine. We didn't believe we had enough steam to power that turbine up to its full capacity. After we started it up, we were able to completely rebalance the steam distribution within the mill, the steam generation, steam consumption. And we originally budgeted for about 70% own make electricity. First quarter was an all-time record. We averaged 85% of our own make electricity in the mill. And we had days where we were essentially spot right on the verge of being self sufficient with our own make electricity.","So that turbine generator is one example of a real game changer. And that mill that has allowed us to stand back and look at a number of opportunities now that are very no capital, low capital, but just process control, process fine-tuning, and then, of course, the Jackson Mill after the owners last year allowed us to really, really rebalance our Jackson run.","Mark Weintraub","I know the first question had a lot in it, but I think you started to answer a part of it, which was when you look at the fiber, the energy, and the freight, year-over-year that was $0.16 in total improvement. And I just tried to get a sense as to how much of it was just a function of the underlying commodity, i.e. the price of gas being lower versus the efficiency improvement such as what you were just talking about with that I Falls?","Mark Kowlzan","Bob, why don't you give some more color on that?","Robert Mundy","Yes, Mark. I would say about maybe like 60% or so is more price-related. And the things that Mark just spoke of, 40% or so was more on the usage side of the improvements that have been made.","Mark Kowlzan","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.","Chip Dillon","First question is I know that you all very clearly laid out about $200 million in synergies you were looking for in the wake of the Boise deal and that's been 2.5 years. Could you just gives us a kind of view of how you look at, if there are further opportunities as we think about your current footprint.","Do you see a certain amount of additional, maybe not synergies, but just cost reduction opportunities. You've certainly laid out a couple of that have been very impressive in white paper, but as we look through the rest of '16 and '17, are there more things you'll be doing on the cost side that will maybe even offset inflation and then some?","Mark Kowlzan","Yes, Chip, everyday technology and engineering organization is not only involved in the eight paper mills, but we've got Tom's side of the business, the group that's working on operational effectiveness and efficiency in the box plants, but your question about the $200 million run rate synergies and where do we go from there, we've called out last July on the call we wouldn't be detailing and defining synergy contributions per se, but we did indicate that obviously these number would continue to compound, but it would be as we run PCA we make continuous improvement and that's what we're all about.","We're about operational execution, continuous improvement, so work on hundreds and hundreds of these opportunities at any given time during year, and so it's safe to say, we've done this historically for the better part 16 years now. We will continue to make improvements. We have a portfolio of opportunities that we're currently working on, on both sides of the business. And I'm talking about paper mills, legacy brown mills and the corrugated product side business.","And so some of them are cost reductions, some of the business enhancing, but fortunate aspect of this is we have our own engineering group. We have our own technology organization. Most of the engineering has done ourselves, so we can execute and move forward very quickly and so I'm very pleased with the opportunities as we go forward that we can continue to work on at least a piece of the inflation.","Chip Dillon","Looking at the white paper, I think you said in your commentary that for the guidance for the second quarter that very -- I'm assuming not very much of the price increase. And of course, earlier other parts of that white paper spectrum saw announcements for increases away from cut size. So as I think about it, I know typically we don't normally get the full price increase that gets announced, but that's not always the case.","But if we were to sort of think about of whatever -- what do you have in mind in the second quarter in terms how much will be felt. Are you basically saying it's a third quarter event for you, and therefore very little of it's in the second quarter or none of it or can you just give us some feel for how much of it would be in the second quarter guidance?","Mark Kowlzan","Obviously, I can't speculate and quantify the amount we expect regarding pricing the third quarter, but yes, because of the way this would flow through, any pricing that has been achieved would come in the late second quarter. And as an example of that we do have a good portion of our business tied to indexes, and so printing paper is one thing, that is part of printing and converting. That was in April, and basically the price was -- we know it by customers.","We are invoicing. Office papers, cut size reprographic that will be a May event, so then you would look at something coming out in June publication to see what's being picked up. And then, you would wait to see a July publication to see what was picked up and we go from there, but we can't speculate, that's how the system works.","Chip Dillon","So I guess, said differently, if it does all go through, which again, we don't know it's speculation, but if it did all go through probably more than two-thirds of it would not be felt till the third quarter. Is that the fair statement?","Mark Kowlzan","Yes. Again, it would be primarily a third quarter event.","Chip Dillon","And then last question is, again, looking at the environment, it seems like that we've seen a tremendous amount of continued industry vertical integration. It seems like barely, a few weeks go by, and you hear about another sheet feeder or box plant either being bought or consolidating somehow into a group that also involves mills.","And I was just sort of wondering, are you seeing that we're kind of close to the end of that, and therefore, it's continuing to be tougher to find solid box plant opportunities to acquire? I know you said, that had been a big focus a few years ago, and I just didn't know if you felt that, but is something that that, whether time has passed for that or could there be more out there?","Mark Kowlzan","Especially with the integration completed now, and I'm going to let Tom weigh in, in just a minute, but obviously the way we view the world, there are opportunity that exist. We're continually keeping our eyes open for what is out there. And there are fewer opportunities, naturally you would think to the consolidation. But Tom, why don't you weight in and add a little color on that?","Thomas Hassfurther","First, Chip, I'll just mention that there is no question that industry consolidation has taken place. Of course, we can't speak for the industry, and I had no idea to what extent we're at the end by any means, but because there is still a relatively large independent market out there in terms of numbers of plants, certainly smaller in terms of their market share, because of the consolidation.","But there are some, as we've said in the past, we virtually explore any and all opportunities that are out there. Some opportunities don't meet the requirements that we have for acquisitions. And we have a very disciplined approach. And if it's not a good fit, based on the criteria we have, we move on. We're not going to make acquisitions just for the sake of making them, but at the same time, I will tell you that there are always I think some opportunities out there that can present themselves.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal.","Mark Wilde","Mark, I just wonder, we're getting more questions from people about just sort of potential growth opportunities for Packaging Corp. And I wondered if you could just talk about that in general terms, you and Tom have both just talked about box plants, but opportunities beyond that?","Mark Kowlzan","I don't want to speculate in terms of what we would do, could do, but obviously in the last couple of quarters, speaking to investors and analyst we've made it clear that all of the heavy lifting is behind us regarding Boise integration. And balance sheet is in great shape generating a lot of cash and so we have an enormous amount of flexibility and capability as we go forward to look at small one-off deals and\/or some larger deals if it made sense and was the right thing to do.","And the other thing that's significant, we've got the organization to do it. We've got the people in place in both operationally, marketing and sales to do some significant opportunity. So we'll continue to look at the horizon but you just can't speculate. But right now, we're at a great place.","Mark Wilde","I wondered kind of going back to kind of Boise that was the first time since you've been a public company that you really went out and bought any mill assets and it seems like the performance there has been even better than you expected. Has that made you think a little differently about sort of what kind of options you'd look at going forward?","Mark Kowlzan","I think, two things, Boise was attractive to us because we absolutely needed the containerboard tons. We were, at that point in 2012, and we were buying outside tons, as a matter of fact, we're buying couple of hundred thousand tons of outside containerboard to support our growth, and so the key to Boise was truly the DeRidder mill and then obviously the legacy brown side of the business.","That being said, we have been very successful. And yet the paper business -- and we call this out early. We felt compelled that we could improve that paper business and continue to bring cost out of it and enhance the capability, but that being said, we are and will remain a corrugated products containerboard business, basically that's our concentration, that's what we do and that's what we will continue to focus on. As we grow our integration which is currently about 87% level, we will look at how we support Tom's need for containerboard tons and that would play into other opportunities.","Mark Wilde","Just a couple of other follow-ons. One, a lot of your pears in paperboard packaging have been starting to expand down in Mexico. I think you guys were down there briefly after you bought Boise because they had the Hexacomb business down there? Any thoughts on that market?","Mark Kowlzan","Mexico is a good market, but we've never had the reach in terms of operating offshore. Once you start operating offshore, you've got a lot of legal and financial matters that you have to deal with and we're not good at that. We operate here in the United States and we just don't have the desire to start getting into that complexity. We've got a plenty to do here.","Mark Wilde","Last thing I wondered, Tom Hassfurther, I notice the investor productions non-durable goods has been pretty sluggish and the box volumes have been doing well. Any thoughts on that disparity?","Mark Kowlzan","Go ahead, Tom.","Thomas Hassfurther","Well, I would say, Mark, certainly one of the things that probably is really unique of the box business today versus what it was just compared to even three years ago or five years ago. Of course, you know the e-commerce side of the business has picked up dramatically. And that's a growth engine for us. So I think that's been an area that has probably presented some opportunities for the industry in total to help get our numbers up a little bit over what we [technical difficulty].","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.","Scott Lehman","This is Scott Lehman in for Mark. Just two quick ones. First off, you mentioned exports being a smaller part of the mix of outside board sales in the quarter. And with export prices falling recently, how do you guys view that? Do you still view exports as a regular part of the business, as it has been in the past?","Mark Kowlzan","That hasn't changed. As we said many times, we continue to support a number of our legacy customers that have bought containerboard from us for the better part of a few decades. We do supply in to about 35 different countries. So we have no one big customer that we're tied to.","And if you recall from our comments last year and this year, because the first quarter starts heavy annual shutdown season, we tend to sell less on the export side of the equation and retain those tons for our own internal consumption. But the number on a percentage basis has ranged from 8%, 10% or 12%, and we're still in that range in total. As a matter of fact, that really didn't change from last year, where we are right now year-to-date.","Scott Lehman","And then just another quick one from a freight\/logistics standpoint. This is kind of two quarters in a row that you've pointed to positives from a logistics endpoint. And I know last year, the industry saw lots of issues and a lot of competitors in the industry used that as an excuse for keeping higher inventories and even last quarter that kind of lagged into there.","So I wanted to know from your perspective, do you think that those logistic issues for you guys are in the rearview mirror? And how is that going to affect your inventory management going forward? And second, what makes you guys different than some of the other guys in the industry, where you saw these logistics issues kind of fall off a lot earlier?","Mark Kowlzan","Well, I think we don't consider it in the rearview mirror. Freight continues to be something of concern to us. What we've been able to take advantage of is, a good example is the fact that with DeRidder fully optimized and capable of producing liner and medium and all of the key grades, we have a lot of flexibility with how we move product from our containerboard mills into our box plants. And so we've developed some really good capabilities with the carriers on how to move those tons through the various lanes in a very efficient manner.","Now, also with the fact that the economy did slow down a little bit, there has been some slight improvement in carrier availability to us, trucks that is, but that doesn't mean that pricing has necessarily improved there, it just that we have developed a very good efficiency and capability within that side of the business in terms of how we move product.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays.","Scott Gaffner","When I look at the guidance for the second quarter, just looking at the sequential trends on the operating performance, how do you think about, you mentioned best-ever operating performance in 1Q, you sort of look at that normalizing a little bit when you give guidance for the second quarter around operational performance or how should we think about that?","Robert Mundy","The goal is always to continue to improve. We feel pretty good about where we are, because what we saw of the last three months wasn't just something that happened, it was a combination of what has been going on in the white paper business for the last couple of years.","And then on the ground side, quite frankly, well, this has been going on for 20 years, and then DeRidder obviously has been a key focus of. Everyday we'll continue to enhance the capability, but we are at a very high efficiency. We work everyday to maintain that high efficiency. And so that is the goal and that is what we've build our basis on.","Scott Gaffner","And if I look at the packaging business for a minute, I think you said on the last call, the first 13 days of 1Q, the bookings and billings were flat year-over-year. You finished up 1.7% on a per work day basis. So did demand grow as the quarter went on? And what does it look like so far in April?","Mark Kowlzan","Tom, why don't you go ahead and put some color on that one?","Thomas Hassfurther","Scott, yes, demand did grow as the quarter went on. That's pretty typical for our first quarter. Second quarter starting out, for the first 11 days we're up 1% over tough comps from the previous year. So we're pleased with where we are at this point.","Scott Gaffner","And then the share buyback in the quarter, you did $100 million, what was the average price per share on the buyback?","Robert Mundy","$50.49 is the average price.","Scott Gaffner","You bought the stock fairly well, I would say, being as how it's $64 and changed today. On a go-forward basis, how should we think about the share buyback versus capital allocation of some of these other opportunities that you mentioned in regards to Mark's question, so basically the balance between share buyback and acquisition?","Mark Kowlzan","We always view share buyback from an opportunistic perspective. And so that's truly the key word right there, opportunistic. I've said this on the last few calls as far as acquisition opportunities, we will reserve the right to use cash to apply to great growth acquisition opportunities.","And so again, if you're spending, using the cash for dividends, share buyback, debt reduction, acquisition, CapEx or some sort, and so very mindful of that. But again, we are in at position right now that would be, the stock is up obviously over that low average $50.49 acquisition of the 2 million shares that we did. So then you look at your hand. And again, I'm not going to provide any detail other than that.","Operator","Your next question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America Securities.","George Staphos","I guess, I want to put together a couple of topics that were discussed earlier, as it relates to the white paper business. Given the performance that you've seen, has it changed at all what might have been your strategic view of its fit in the portfolio, say a couple of years ago to the present time? And I know the answer is, there is more to come, but is there a way at all to quantify, Mark, how much more opportunity you have to improve operations within the white paper business?","Mark Kowlzan","George, that's a tough number. Again, all we can do is tell you that history provides the answer here. We'll continue to go ahead and make improvements in efficiencies and working on cost. Ultimately, I don't know what that means. I mean, you've got inflationary factors with energy, wood, hard raw material. But for the fact that we can control, we'll continue to work on these things.","I think one factor that is important, we're at a point with the white paper mills, we're not faced with any one enormous amount of capital requirement in these white mills, they're in very good condition, well capitalized. So what we do is we look at the small opportunities. But if you do a 100 small things, the result can be worth an enormous amount to you.","And so I'm very encouraged that all things being equal, we continue to generate a good return for what we have invested in this white business. And it generates a lot of cash, as we said before, and we'll continue to apply improvements to it. But I really can't quantify going forward what that means.","George Staphos","Mark, that's fair. I wouldn't assume that you could, but I wanted to ask it anyway. But on the strategic side, has your view of its fit in the portfolio changed at all? And you said this more than once, you certainly said it on this conference call earlier a year, ultimately a packaging company. But would you ever consider, given your success here, growing the white paper business?","Mark Kowlzan","Again, we are going to maintain our focus on the containerboard, corrugated product side of business. That's where in terms of what we're really good at, what we're focused on, that's our business, that's our core business. And we're going to remain heavily involved in that.","Again, the paper business it hasn't hurt us per se in terms of valuation. And we're not in a position, where we have to do one thing or another with that business. It's a great business for us right now as it stands and we will just continue to operate it and generate a lot of cash with it.","George Staphos","I wanted to switch for my last question, and I'll turn it over. Again, obviously, you did very well this quarter, certainly better than our forecast, a lot of that was from operations. When we look back last year that was obviously an atypical quarter for Packaging Corp. in terms of operations, you had some trouble coming out of the outages at D1 and you had issues with D3.","Is it possible to quantify how much of that $0.08 benefit, I think you said it was from maintenance outages were related to just getting over what were the problems in last year's quarter? And then, if possible, is there a way to quantify how much anniversarying the D3 ramp was, a drive of the increase in production year-on-year this quarter versus last year's quarter?","Mark Kowlzan","Regarding the first part on the quarter-to-quarter, the $0.08, the bulk of that was the DeRidder outage. It was a massive outage last year. And not just the fact that we had the delayed number 1 work that went on and the heavy lifting on number 3, but that was a massive outage, total mill-wide work going on.","And as you look at this past first quarter, we had an annual outage at DeRidder, addressed all of the things that we would normally address, and so it wasn't nearly as impactful. And so again, the bulk of that $0.08 will come from the fact that it was just a second shutdown we would have experienced and we were putting a lot of corrective action to mills. So, yes, that was the total.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank.","Debbie Jones","I have a couple of questions on Slide 3. First, related to labor. I actually thought that was going to be a bit more of a headwind. If you take a look at what happened last year in the first quarter, I think it was a low-teens impact on a cent basis. And I'm just wondering is there something different here that we should not be expecting going forward or something else offsetting this?","Mark Kowlzan","Bob, why don't you go ahead and answer that?","Robert Mundy","Yes, when we gave the guidance, we were talking about fourth quarter to first quarter. And labor actually was that negative, those timing items that hit you at the beginning of year that actually occurred as we expected. But year-over-year it was maybe not as fierce it was in the previous year-over-year comparison. And some of that has to do with some of the things Mark has done on the hourly side of optimizing some of the things, the workforce and the mills and somewhat in box plants as well. So that certainly helped us year-over-year.","Debbie Jones","And then, if I could just stick with the slide on containerboard and corrugated prices and mix, is that was also a little bit less of a hit than we expected? And you said on the last call that you're trying to get a sense of what the liner decrease was it going to have and the impact on your contracts. And I was wondering if you just can talk about what you're sense is of how much this might be an impact? The delta from Q1 to Q2, anything around that would be helpful?","Mark Kowlzan","Let me answer that, Debbie. We're anticipating for the second quarter. We'll probably see on the containerboard sales side probably $0.50 on export containerboard, $0.50 on the domestic containerboard and probably about $0.001 in our corrugated products. So about $0.02 in total on Tom side of the business.","Debbie Jones","And I could just one more on the fiber side. Was there like a regional difference there? Were there certain parts of the country where you and your benefit was a little bit better than others?","Mark Kowlzan","No. We were fortunate because of the truly mild winter weather that we saw all the way from the International Falls, Canadian Border for the Gulf Coast, East Coast, West Coast. We certainly did not have anything near that would have been typical winter weather that would have put pressure on the wood baskets. Little bit of that rain issue about a month and half ago in Louisiana, but the DeRidder mill was spared. Most of the rain went into that north and much further west of the DeRidder basin, so wood basket has been spared this year in terms of any unusual issues nationwide.","Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup.","Anthony Pettinari","Just following up on Debbie's question on fiber costs, following the benefit you saw in the quarter. Do you have a view on fiber inflation in the second quarter both in pulpwood? And then in OCC it seems like we've had prices tick up a little bit for the first time in nine, 10 months. Can you just talk about the fiber cost environment in 2Q?","Mark Kowlzan","Again, going into the second quarter, I mean it's pretty flat with where we left the first quarter, but that being said, if we get into a hurricane season in the Gulf Coast and we start putting some more widespread rain throughout the Gulf Coastal region that could change the fiber cost make up. But right now everything, as far as, in line with how we came out of first quarter. Obviously, what's been mentioned in the publications, but keeping in mind, we still have the lowest consumer user OCC in the industry. And so on a dollar-to-dollar basis least impacted.","Robert Mundy","And then pulp and paper weak kraft liner prices have been flat since the cut in January, but they've talked about discounting and recycled liner, which seems like its widened a bit. Is that something that you're seeing in the marketplace or is it something that really impacts PCA or is this kind of discounting more in regions or categories or customers where you're not really participating?","Mark Kowlzan","Tom wants to go ahead and put some color on it.","Thomas Hassfurther","Anthony, I would say that, it's certainly an impact if pulp and paper continues to rationalize the two together, but we see recycled linerboard and kraft linerboard as being two very different products especially when it comes to performance. And the majority of our customer base is very performance oriented. So from the standpoint of actually direct competing with this, it's not that much of an impact. But certainly, w what pulp and paper does, it could impact.","Anthony Pettinari","And Tom from your comments, is it fair to say you think pulp and paper, you should formally breakout recycled list price in the way that they have kraft liner list price.","Thomas Hassfurther","I can't comment on that Anthony. All I can say is, is that the two products in our opinion are very different.","Mark Kowlzan","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies & Company.","Philip Ng","Mark thanks for providing some color on how you at least expect export prices to be from a head standpoint in 2Q. But can you talk about what are you seeing pricing probably on export? Are you starting to see that stabilize a bit? Certainly the dollar has strengthened a little bit. Can you kind of help frame what portion of your export business is tied to Europe specifically?","Mark Kowlzan","Regarding that I mean truly all of our export pricing activities has been primarily related to currency fluctuations. And so that being said just pure speculation on what's going to happen at this week or next week regarding dollar versus currency. So that's truly the impact of -- we did see some slight decrease from 4Q into 1Q as we call out. But other than that, I don't want to speculate.","And what was the rest of your question, we didn't quite hear you.","Philip Ng","What portion of your export business is tied to Europe specifically?","Mark Kowlzan","Tied to Europe?","Philip Ng","Yes.","Mark Kowlzan","Probably less than half. Total offshore containerboard sales.","Philip Ng","And then I guess switching gear a little bit. How you think about box shipment demand broadly for the full year? 1Q certainly turning a little better and least start April decent, but at least we're starting to see some green shoots on the industry timing. Are you seeing that side of business pick up a little bit?","Mark Kowlzan","Again, I don't want to speculate anymore. One quarter at a time where we are right now, but all I want to say about that, truly if the GDP and the economy starts improving in a significant manner you're going to see, theoretically, box demand grow with it. And so it's truly a GDP economic growth relationship here. That's all I want to say about that.","Philip Ng","And just one last one from me, just piggy backing off of a Debbie's question earlier. I mean, I guess, the sequential decline in box prices with the VBW adjustment back in January, it seems a little smaller than we would have thought. Is it, I guess, much smaller portion of your business tied to box contracts that triggered the $15 level versus maybe higher number just because it seems pretty modest or is it more 3Q event?","Mark Kowlzan","I will answer it this way, we talked about this in January. We've got 15,000 plus customers. We're highly integrated. And there are various trigger points that flow through to a box and so it's very complex and there is no one size fits all there, and so that $15 and $20 change in containerboard, would feel in that we understand what the implication is, and we call that out, but again that's all we ever want to say about it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo.","Chris Manuel","To kind of delve into a little different direction into what you're saying in some of your board markets. Given the fact and you talked a little bit about this, but some of the different grades have moved more in price than others, 42-pound linerboard holding up better than so many other pieces.","We're seeing some substitution on the medium side. Folks go into more recycled versus semi-camp. Have you had any of your customers or folks come back to you looking to substitute some cheaper price to stuff in and kind of embedded in the box. I mean one of the assumptions we've long made is that boxes are largely kind of over engineered in North America, any color you have will be helpful?","Mark Kowlzan","Tom, why don't you go ahead and get into that.","Thomas Hassfurther","Well, Chris it's a complex subject obviously, when you start talking about substitution. I would contend that our objective is to give our customers what they need to perform and not more, not less, tailored to what they need in their performance, and I think that's pretty much the direction of the industry. I think it's been stated in the past that there has been the case for over-packaging and all these other sorts of things, but I think that the statistics now support the fact that we become very much performance based industry and certainly we have with PCA.","So that's what we sell and that's what quiet frankly what our customer's expect. So they don't typically get into demanding substitutions or demanding this or that or that sort of thing and ends up thus to provide the right solutions for them. So those that are heavily in that recycled arena they're selling one product primarily, and so it's a different animal to some extent. So hopefully that kind of explains where we are.","Chris Manuel","When you think about -- and I don't think this is an issue that you have, but when we look at some of the newer capacity that has come on stream, it's mostly been recycled, but yet you and some others still have -- and you flexed it a bit this quarter when you ramped up DeRidder to kind of full steam, while you did some other outages. You still seem to have some sort of latent, whether it's virgin or some other capacity that isn't all the way utilized. How do you think about being able to kind of get all of that back to full steam as you look forward to next six to 12 months? It seems to be there is not as much incremental capacity coming on stream, but do you think that that's a fair path?","Mark Kowlzan","Tom, why don't you go ahead?","Thomas Hassfurther","Well, I'm not sure I completely -- you might restate that just a little bit more for me, Chris, so I can really understand exactly what it is you're asking, it's kind of broad question, so if you wouldn't mind it, I'd appreciate it.","Chris Manuel","No problem. I guess, really what I am getting at is I think, this quarter you ran DeRidder really hard, closer to full capacity. And now you did so because you had some other outages. So kind of implicitly within there is in some ways you're sort of holding back production through your system over the past year or at different times, that you had some incremental capacity. How do you think about being able to utilize all your incremental all the capacities you have and kind of get into running full as opposed to just running the demand, you need to run the demand, but when do you think those began to intersect, is that a 12 months window?","Thomas Hassfurther","Yes, I got it now. That's very had to predict, I mean of course we just run the demand, that's what we do. Our extra capacity that we have will be utilized as we growth the business. That's pure and simple. I mean, if we make a sizable acquisition or something that's obviously going to suck up a lot of it, as opposed to organic growth, but we'll continue to grow in those segments that we've always tried to grow in before.","If you think about it anyway, we're at 87% integration. And so if you did have any capacity, you would be back to where we were in 2012 as net buyers of outside containerboard tons and so again we're at pretty good balance right now running our system and being able to flex with Tom's need.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson.","Steve Chercover","You articulated the factors for the $0.11 beat, and we will take you at your word. But when you establish the guidance for Q1, the economic backdrop was pretty gloomy. So I am just wondering, did demand exceed your expectations at all? And then, how are you feeling about the economy today? Maybe better than you were two months ago?","Mark Kowlzan","When we had the January call, obviously we just had probably 11 days of consumption on Tom's side of the business at that point. And we were feeling okay. But as the quarter went on, we did see demand pick up. Again, we're not economist, so I can't fully explain. But I think we were pleased with what we saw especially coming off last year's big numbers. We had tough comps to run against last year. So in that regard, I think we are pleased. Tom, why don't you add something to that?","Thomas Hassfurther","Yes, Steve. I'd just say that one of the things that have taken place if you recall late last year and midway through the third quarter and certainly in the fourth quarter, as we alluded to on our calls, we had existed some business. And that we had gotten in the Boise acquisition. That was all part of our synergies. And I think that obviously can help on our market side.","But we were coming out of that, and so it was a little tough for us to forecast what that impact would be. Continuing to go into this year, we felt like we had it all behind us, it turns out we did and how quickly we can turn it and get back into that growth mode was important to us and quite frankly a little difficult to predict.","End of Q&A","Mark Kowlzan","With that, operator, I believe we're out of time. And so thank everybody for joining us. I look forward to talking with you all in July. Have a good day.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"16956":["Packaging Corporation of America (NYSE:PKG) Q2 2019 Earnings Conference Call July 25, 2019  9:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Mark Kowlzan - CEO","Tom Hassfurther - EVP","Bob Mundy - CFO","Conference Call Participants","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs","Gabe Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research","Mark Connelly - Stephens","George Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets","Anthony Pettinari - Citi","Mark Weintraub - Seaport Global","Adam Josephson - KeyBanc","Edlain Rodriguez - UBS","Operator","Thank you for joining Packaging Corporation of America's Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Results Conference Call. Your host today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chief Executive Officer of PCA. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Kowlzan, and please proceed when you're ready, sir.","Mark Kowlzan","Good morning, and thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's second quarter 2019 earnings release conference call. I am Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA, and with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs the Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. I'll begin the call with an overview of our second quarter results. And then I'm going to turn the call over to Tom and Bob who will provide more details. And then I'll wrap things up and then we'd be glad to take questions.","Yesterday, we reported second quarter net income of $194 million or $2.04 per share. This compares to a second quarter 2018 net income of $197 million or $2.08 per share, excluding special items. Second quarter net sales were $1.8 billion in both 2019 and 2018. Total company EBITDA for the second quarter was $376 million in 2019 and $382 million in 2018, excluding special items. The $0.04 per share decrease in second quarter 2019 earnings compared to the second quarter of 2018, excluding special items, was driven primarily by higher operating costs of $0.27, higher converting costs of $0.05, lower volume in our paper segment of $0.04, higher annual outage expenses of $0.06, and a higher tax rate of $0.01. ","These higher operating and converting costs were primarily due to cost increases with labor and benefits expenses as well as indirect costs, such as repair and operating materials, outside services, equipment and building rental expenses, property taxes and insurance. These items were partially offset by higher volume of $0.09 and prices and mix of $0.08 in our packaging segment, higher prices and mix in our paper segment of $0.16 and lower Wallula number three paper machine conversion related costs of $0.04, and lower freight costs of $0.02.","Looking at the packaging business, EBITDA in the second quarter 2019 of $349 million with sales of $1.5 billion resulted in a margin of 23.2% versus last year's EBITDA excluding special items of $363 million and sales of $1.5 billion or a 24.2% margin. We continue to run our containerboard mills to demand, as we lowered our inventory levels from the first quarter and maintained our industry leading integration rate by supplying our box plants with the necessary containerboard to establish a new second quarter record for box shipments per day. Our employees did an outstanding job of running cost effectively, while balancing supply with demand and optimizing our containerboard footprint to minimize freight and logistics costs across the system. We ended the quarter with inventories at the appropriate level to meet our seasonally stronger third quarter demand.","I'll now turn it over to Tom who will provide more details on containerboard sales and the corrugated business in general.","Tom Hassfurther","Thank you, Mark. As Mark indicated, our corrugated products plants had record second quarter box shipments per day, which were up 0.3% compared to last year\u2019s second quarter, in spite of the significant business loss we incurred at Sacramento container due to a purchase of two large sheet customers by another integrated. Outside sales volumes of container board was about 16,000 tons below last year\u2019 second quarter as we ran our containerboard system to demand and supplied the increased needs of our box plants. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.16 per share above the second quarter of 2018 and down $0.09 per share compared to the first quarter of 2019. Export container board prices were down $0.08 per share compared to the second quarter 2018 and down $0.04 per share compared to the first quarter of 2019.","I'll now turn it back to Mark.","Mark Kowlzan","Thanks, Tom. Looking at our paper segment, EBITDA in the second quarter was $48 million, with sales of $238 million or a 20.3% margin compared to second quarter 2018 EBITDA of $38 million, excluding special items and sales of 251 million or a 15.0% margin. Our cup size and printing and converting volumes were slightly above the second quarter of 2018. Overall prices moved higher during the quarter, but industry conditions seem to soften a bit in June. We successfully completed an annual outage at our International Falls mill and our mill system is currently running extremely well with increased focus on our most profitable products. The lower revenues compared to last year\u2019s second quarter are a result of the exit from the white papers business at the Wallula mill last year. We continue to improve our profitability and margins in the paper segment, in part by exiting this business at Wallula, rather than continuing to allocate people and capital resources to it.","I'll now turn it over to Bob.","Bob Mundy","Thanks, Mark. For the second quarter, cash provided by operations was $302 million and free cash flow was a record 210 million. The primary uses of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of 92 million, common stock dividends totaled $75 million; $78 million for federal and state income tax payments, net interest payments of 36 million and pension contributions of $4 million. We ended the quarter with $569 million of cash on hand.","I\u2019ll now turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Kowlzan","Thanks, Bob. Looking ahead, as we move forward into the -- from the second into the third quarter, in our packaging segment, we expect seasonally higher containerboard and corrugated product shipments with lower prices as a result of the published domestic containerboard price decreases and lower export prices. In the paper segment, we expect volume to be seasonally stronger, but prices and mix to move lower. Converting and other costs should be slightly higher. But operating costs and scheduled maintenance outage costs should be lower. Considering these items, we expect third quarter earnings of $1.91 per share.","With that, we\u2019d be happy to entertain any questions. But I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call today constitute forward-looking statements. The statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC. The actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.","And with that operator, I'd like to go ahead and open up the call to questions please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Maguire","Just a question on the outlook for the third quarter, obviously, we saw some deterioration in index prices from the publication as you noted, just wondering how much of a, already recognized price declines will be in that $1.91 guide and how much of that you\u2019d still have to flow through into the fourth quarter.","Mark Kowlzan","As we mentioned in the past, the published price changes impact the domestic containerboard volume fairly quickly. So all of the published price decreases impacted our domestic and trade prices to varying degrees during the second quarter. But also keep in mind, we've talked in the past about how price increases roll through the box side of the business. And that also applies to price decreases. And these businesses have various triggers and factors and timing mechanisms across our 18,000 or so customers whereby the vast majority of the changes will flow through typically over a 90-day period. So, you'd have to expect and you can assume that the same cadence, once the published price index move down in March, May and June, and we\u2019ll see that happen now. So, we'll finish seeing the remainder of the price decreases flow through in this third quarter.","Bob, you want to add to that or Tom, you want to add?","Tom Hassfurther","No.","Brian Maguire","Just on the volumes, I think you noted that packaging volumes added $0.09 to EPS in the quarter. But I was just hoping you could reconcile that with the fact that the box shipments were down around 1.3%, just how did it drive that earnings contribution year-over-year.","Mark Kowlzan","Yeah, let me comment and then Bob can give you a little more clarity. Don't forget that as we exited the paper business last year, we brought Wallula up in June. And so we had Wallula coming on and there was a change taking place between segments.","Bob, you want to elaborate on it?","Bob Mundy","Yeah. And on the packaging volume, Brian, with the work we finished up at DeRidder early last year, and of course the Wallula conversion, when you look at our volume, year-over-year, we actually reduced outside purchases by almost 75,000 tons. So -- and so now, we've internalized those tons. So you get the benefit of OMEG [ph] tons, which is one of the, our high integration rate, provides us that benefit of OMEG versus outside purchases. And so you saw that, and that definitely has an income positive effect, even though volumes in total may not have moved so much.","Brian Maguire","Okay, so that is reflected in the volume number more than the input cost number?","Bob Mundy","Right.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo Securities.","Gabe Hajde","Tommy, you normally give us a little bit of insight into sort of trends into July. I was curious if you can do that for us and then touch on any particular end markets where you're seeing softness or strength.","Mark Kowlzan","Okay. Gabe, yeah, through 14 days, our billings and bookings are up about 5.8%. So we're starting out the month and the quarter very well. One of the key driver areas for us right now, going into the second half is the ag business out in the West and the Pacific Northwest. It's, -- those crops came in late this year due to weather and but they're coming on strong now. So, we're very encouraged with the outlook going into the quarter.","Gabe Hajde","And then if you can maybe comment at all, Mark or Bob, regarding capital allocation priorities and how you're thinking about, I guess, returning some cash to shareholders, whether it's through increased dividends or opportunities in the market otherwise?","Mark Kowlzan","Yeah, regarding general capital spending, we're still on target for this year be in that low-400 area. And that's proceeding well in terms of, we\u2019ve got the big Richland project that\u2019s going to be coming on later this year. As far as uses of cash, the same, it's always applied. You've got share buyback, dividends, capital spending, acquisition type opportunities, and we\u2019ll continue to be opportunistic and look at the best value for shareholders. That's about as straightforward as it gets.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.","Chip Dillon","First question is, we know that there is some changes in the marketplace, I guess, with lighter weighting taking place. And I was just curious, I know, you have just recently started up some virgin capacity at Wallula. But would you be interested in buying from others, recycle boards saved in your -- some of your Western box plans?","Mark Kowlzan","Chip, my answer to that is no. And, we will always buy some board from the outside market. But that's generally specialty grades. Now, keep in mind when we were -- our integration, it basically got nowhere 100%. We\u2019re open market buyers for general, containerboard meeting and liner board, but in general, as long as we can supply our own, we wouldn't be interested in any kind of joint venture or partnership with anybody.","Tom, you want to elaborate on that?","Tom Hassfurther","Yeah, I\u2019ll just talk about the end market a little bit, Chip. We really see the end market moving much more towards performance based products, which we consider recycle having a little more difficult time getting there. So, we've got a long term reputation for meeting quality standards and adding value and doing all those other sorts of things, even though it's a commodity product to some extent, and we're certainly not going to be in a position where we're going to perhaps risk that reputation over aligning ourselves with somebody with recycle board.","Chip Dillon","And just as a quick follow up, you mentioned, Mark that [indiscernible] CapEx for this year, I know it's early days, but can you at least give us some directional guidance in terms of where that number could be next year? If you have any inkling at this point, not that we'd hold you to it. And then if Bob, could you just remind us of the maintenance expense per quarter in the second and then what it will be in the third and the fourth. I know you've given it in the past, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s changed either.","Mark Kowlzan","Chip, regarding capital spending, we always give basically one quarter updates. And then for the New Year coming up, 2020, we\u2019ll give you an update in January. I think let me answer a little bit of that this way. We've identified some very good opportunities for us. We've got some efficiency cost take out opportunities in the mill side, as we always do that we will spend some small amount of capital on, very risk free high return capital for next year. And then, we've got some projects in the box plants that we're going to continue to aggressively go after that. It not only adds capacity opportunity, as we grow the business, but also it's some of the new technology will take cost of, but we'll wait until January and give you next year's number.","Bob Mundy","Chip, on the outage impact in the second, it was $0.18. We expect it to be around $0.08 in the third and somewhere, $0.14, $0.15 in the fourth.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens.","Mark Connelly","Mark, if I could just follow up on that question about the box plants. I think you're saying that the reinvestment in the box plants is still primarily focused on productivity. But is there sort of a directional trend that you're trying to take your equipment as well to meet some sort of changing performance expectations of the market?","Mark Kowlzan","Well, I think, you got to look at this way, it's a twofer. You get two bangs for your buck here. With any new capital spending, we have going on in the box plants, you theoretically are going to improve your capacity opportunity. But also from a technology point of view, you're making the overall process more efficient in terms of unit labor input for a conversion unit. So we're looking at that, as in the last few years, as we've reached, in many cases, some capacity limitations in these box plants, it behooves us to take advantage of the technology that's available. And as we've also said earlier this year, we also have the manpower to execute in a very effective manner. The big projects are done in the mill. So with the new engineering technology organization, we have a very broad capability to go ahead and engineer and construct these box plant projects through in-house PCA personnel.","Tom, you want to have a little more?","Tom Hassfurther","Yeah. Mark, I think the best way to put it is, is that, our reinvestment in the box plants is driven by profitable growth and operating efficiencies, which are really driven by our customers\u2019 demands and their needs. That's primarily, as I said many times, I mean, we don't build it and hope they will come. And we really react to what our customers\u2019 needs are.","Mark Connelly","Just one more question. Your white paper performance is obviously a little better than what the industry is telling us is happening overall. Are you surprised, as you go out to the market, do you see what the AMPA [ph] numbers are showing with these huge drops, and you're just outperforming that by a mile, because we see a disconnect between the AMPA numbers and what's going on in the market? And I'm just curious whether you do?","Mark Kowlzan","Well, regarding volume, our marketplace is such that our customer base relies on our logistics and distribution capability. And so we really have a great customer mix that relies on our capability to take care of their needs, generally going from a B2B type of a distribution for them. And so, we worked really hard. And this goes back to comments I've made over the last five years at one of Boise strengths that was built over probably four decades was that logistics supplies capability for their customers. And so, we aren't seeing what the general marketplace is seeing. And don't forget too, we've got just a nice tidy business, I'll use that term, we got I Falls in Jackson supplying the North American system, and we're pretty well in balance. So, we're feeling pretty good about our business in particular.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George Staphos","I wanted to first dig in a little bit to the cost trends you talked about in the quarter, Mark and Bob. Can you remind us, was the quarterly and for that matter, a year trend that you've been seeing in things like labor and benefits, have there been any things that have been affecting it more than normal. Was the quarter performance more or less as you'd expected on these operating costs? And could some of these projects that you're working on over time, take a little bit of the edge off of what we'll see in inflation in 2020 and 2021?","Mark Kowlzan","Yeah, George, I would say that, costs were actually, as far as what we expected in the quarter. We're actually a little better than we thought. And I think, as we look into the third, we are seeing some of that. Last year, that was certainly going from 2 to 3, a lot of inflation that was still coming through. This year, I don't think, we're seeing that. Actually, all in probably, all the operating costs should be a slight positive this -- going to the third quarter this year.","George Staphos","Okay. Would you say just related to the projects, in the box plants, are they probably more -- I know, you said Mark, you get a twofer. But is the benefit more so in terms of the ability to grow into the future or do you get disproportionate benefit in terms of margin over time from those investments? How would you have us think about that?","Mark Kowlzan","Again, each plant is unique, each project is unique. And again, it just depends, quite frankly, just depends on how you're going to run that particular operation. So again, it's -- there's no one formula that fits all.","George Staphos","Mark, you had mentioned that you had industry leading integration, which we obviously would know intuitively having, given all that you say across the quarters, over the years, but could you provide an integration level that you expect for the year or where you came in during the quarter? If you had it, that would be helpful? And then I had one last question. I'll turn it over.","Mark Kowlzan","Yeah, our integration is sitting in the low-90s percent area.","George Staphos","And then lastly, back to the earlier question on near term July or recent July trends. If we extract agriculture, are you seeing a similar improvement, call it low to mid-single digits across all of your end markets, and relatedly one of the things that we've been seeing in the markets over the last, I'd say couple of years, we've had kind of a weak end of quarter month, as customers are still somewhat concerned about the macro look, so they pull inventories down. And then as we enter the new quarter, there's some rebuilding of stock. So one, what do you think in other end market, if you can share that data? And two, would you agree that we've had that kind of hand to mouth ordering de-stocking and restocking over the last couple of years? Thanks and good luck in the quarter guys.","Bob Mundy","George, you're quite observant, in my opinion. Yes, that has been the trend in the past. We start out the quarter, quite strong, and we get a little weaker at the end of the quarter. I think that we saw more de-stocking this past first half of the year probably than we've typically seen. And I think that's driven by a lot of the questions regarding the global marketplace. Of course, the export markets have definitely been impacted, as the rest of the globe slows down some. ","So, outside of ag, I mean, I think our business has been relatively stable. And I think it is strengthening going into the second half. I feel more optimistic about it. However, that's one prediction, but I can tell you that I'm hearing from our customers that they feel better about the second half of the year as well. So, I think they've adjusted their business to kind of meet the global demand right now and the domestic demand and feel somewhat confident about the growth prospects going forward.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets.","Mark Wilde","Mark, I wondered, in the release, you do call out that you're running to demand and I wondered if you could just give us a little bit of color on how you kind of are managing the downtime or the flow back. If it's just reducing production across the system or if you\u2019re taking some smaller machines out, just a better color on that.","Mark Kowlzan","We've been really, this was some commentary back from the April earnings call. It's pretty evident, if you look at the math, Wallula obviously is not running to its design capacity. So we've got the extra capacity there. So essentially, we're running Wallula slowed back. And so that's accommodating the Pacific Northwest and West Coast needs. And then from time to time, through the quarter and through the first half of the year, some of our machines have run at a slower pace. But we've been able to flex that, as Tom needed tons and outside customer orders have to be filled. So that's how we've been addressing the running to demand.","Mark Wilde","And then just as we think about the startup at Richland, how much of an impact will that have and when would just start to build some inventory in front of that.","Mark Kowlzan","We're planning on having Richland up at the end of the year and it will be a very positive impact for the Wallula mill. Our plans are to supply all of the medium and liner board that Richland will consume from Wallula. So that's about 18 mile drive up the interstate. And so 2020 should be a very positive year for how the Wallula mill runs its business in terms of ramping up its production capability. We're very optimistic.","Mark Wilde","Last one for me, you're sitting on about $6 a share in cash. So I imagine Bob Mundy is getting kind of sore from hauling all that cash, but just help us think about managing that cash versus putting some of those cash to use in other ways, and how are you doing to take that cash balance.","Bob Mundy","If you look at our net debt to EBITDA ratio, we're sitting probably at around 1.3 historically. If you went back to 2007, we were below 1. So, our cash, we're feeling really, really good in terms of the world around us. We've taken all the risk off the table over the last year with our big conversion projects. We've got some really good high impact projects taking place in the box plants at low risk, immediate return activity. But again, I think, as we look at the world around us and some of the uncertainty, we feel pretty good about building somewhat of a warchest, shall we say, for any opportunity, that may present itself, whether it could be a stock buyback, any type of acquisition opportunity, so we're feeling good, but again, we are, we are and have been living in an uncertain world. And so, we're feeling pretty good about where we are with cash.","And we don't feel compelled that we have to go out and quickly utilize that. Each dollar of cash that's sitting in the bank right now, it's certainly not going to waste. And, again, one of our virtues has been patience. And I think we're exercising that virtue very well in terms of how we look at the utilization of cash for the future returns to the shareholders. So you got to just bear with us.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.","Anthony Pettinari","Mark, in your comments, I think you said white paper industry conditions seem to soften a bit in June. Just wondering if that was a comment on the demand side or the supply side, maybe with some imports coming in or if you could just elaborate on that. And then maybe it's too soon to tell, but is it possible to say how July has trended on the white paper side?","Mark Kowlzan","Yeah. First part of your question was demand softening up in the June period. And part of what we, we typically start seeing the back to school buying and we see that now in July, but we did not see the typical earlier June back to school activity. So that was pretty fundamental. We saw that it was pretty evident, but things have taken off and they're strong right now. So again, we're feeling really good with where we are in July and I'd have to use the term, we're pretty well flat year-over-year with where we are.","And then you commented about imports. Imports are up. But that's -- don't forget that\u2019s to fill a big hole that the industry couldn't fill when some of the industry capacity came out in the earlier part of the year. And so that was a given that everyone expected.","Anthony Pettinari","And then on the corrugated side, looking at the quarter, you had lower shipment growth than you usually do, but you had the Sacramento loss. Putting aside that loss, I was wondering just how shipments trended versus your expectations kind of going into the quarter? And then for modeling purposes, is it possible to remind us when that business loss started to impact your shipments?","Tom Hassfurther","This is Tom. Actually, our last quarter\u2019s performance would have been significantly higher, obviously without that loss. It's a pretty good sized number. And so we feel really good about the trend going in. And of course, where we are through the first 14 days that I reported that includes that loss in Sacramento, so that should give you a little idea of the momentum, we have at least going into the quarter.","What was the second half of your question?","Anthony Pettinari","In terms of when it started to impact your shipments?","Tom Hassfurther","Yeah. That was in the fourth quarter of last year is when it really started to impact our shipments. So we've got a tough comparative going forward until we get to the end of the year.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mark Weintraub with Seaport Global.","Mark Weintraub","So just following up on that, just to clarify. So does the fourth quarter comparison get easier on the box shipments or is it first quarter of next year?","Tom Hassfurther","It gets slightly easier in the fourth quarter, but the real move will be in the first quarter of the following year.","Mark Weintraub","Okay. And is it possible to sort of give a rough sense, is it like a 2% to 3% type impact or could you give us any indication as to the magnitude from Sacramento?","Tom Hassfurther","It's somewhere in the 1.5% range, something like that.","Mark Weintraub","Okay, great. And then would it be possible to get a sense as to how much the caught up at Richland order of magnitude might be?","Tom Hassfurther","Not at this time, I don't think that's appropriate really to talk about that. That's driven by a number of different factors. Certainly, customer demand is one of the key. That's the key element of us putting in Richland, but also keep in mind that we've been supplying that marketplace from a number of different plants quite a ways away. So we're going to be able to take advantage of those transportation savings, both from the box plant and from the mill. So, Richland is going to be an outstanding project that's going to start out in very good shape.","Mark Weintraub","And just one other one. One of your competitors this morning was talking about lower wood cost third quarter versus second quarter. I realize this tends to be a very local market here, could you give us more color as to what's been going on with your wood costs and how you see them playing out for the balance of the year?","Tom Hassfurther","Mark, again, it's localized regional and it\u2019s weather impacted. We're pretty flat. Wood cost has been behaving itself throughout the country this year. So we're in a pretty good place with overall wood cost.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc.","Adam Josephson","Bob, just one on guidance for a moment if you can help me. In terms of the 3Q guidance, what is implied in there in terms of the sequential change in paper price mix, just if you can give me any sense of that?","Bob Mundy","Well, as we said in the release, it's lower on average than it was in the second quarter because as we said, it started to soften a bit in June, and that sort of will carry through into the third. So on average, it's down, we didn't quantify obviously how much down, but it's 15, 20 bucks possibly.","Adam Josephson","And just Tom, on your demand commentary for a moment, you talked about, obviously, the global economy having slowed and your domestic customers just becoming more cautious, managing inventories more tightly. But then you also talked about expecting a second half improvement, and that's because your customers are doing so. So I was just trying to tie those two together. What is driving your customers to expect a second half improvement, just given the slowdown in the global economy that you were talking about?","Tom Hassfurther","What I'm really referring to Adam is the fact that, there was significant inventory reduction that took place throughout the first half of the year. That's basically done. And people feel good about the consumer demand and the economy here in the United States, which is obviously where we've got our large footprint. However, some of our customers do export. So they've adjusted to all of these dynamics that have gone on globally, and I think, feel pretty good about the second half of the year. Also, as I said, we've got some segments, agriculture, being one of them is a big segment that really is driven much more in the second half of the year, especially given the weather related issues that we had out on the west coast and the Pacific Northwest.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Edlain Rodriguez with UBS.","Edlain Rodriguez","One quick question on the e-commerce end market. You have companies like Amazon, like they're taking all sorts of actions to reduce packaging materials. What kind of impact do you expect this to have on the industry? And is this something that keeps you awake at night?","Tom Hassfurther","This is Tom. I'll answer that real quickly. I think over the next couple of years, Amazon's initiatives are going to still be net neutral to the business. It's easy, I think, on the surface to make assumptions that it's probably going to impact the corrugated box business, but I think there's some puts and takes here. One is, is that as we get into this ship in own container or SIOC, as it\u2019s referred to, you're going to have a lot more products that are going to have to gravitate towards corrugated. Because, there still is no better product that can compete and when it comes to containing, protecting and marketing large products. So our customer base is very attuned to this and they're asking for a lot of redesign. ","That redesign has been significant, because keep in mind that they want to protect their brand, they've got to make sure now that that brand goes through, it goes through a longer cycle of handling, all the way through Amazon fulfillment centers and distribution centers and all the way to the customer. And they want that box to be in perfect shape by the time it gets there. And they also wanted to advertise their product. So I think as Amazon requires more of these larger products to be ready to ship in own container that I think we're going to get some growth from one market and a little less from another market.","Edlain Rodriguez","And one quick one on uncoated free sheet, could producers have done a better job managing the supply reduction that happened in the industry without inviting so much in terms of imports, all of a sudden like price increases have to be rolled back. Could the industry have done a better job managing that supply demand issue?","Tom Hassfurther","Let me answer it this way. If you go back and if you -- I've been in this industry for 40 years now. And uncoated free sheet back then was a world supplied product, the Europeans and then was Americans. And then it's spread out through South America and Asia. So imports have always been a factor. So that's how I am going to answer that.","Operator","And we have a follow-up from the line of Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo Securities.","Gabe Hajde","Thank you guys. I'm curious from an operational perspective, you brought up something interesting, Tom, I think kind of value through the supply chain, particularly thinking about e-commerce. And one of the things that you guys have differentiated yourselves with has been high customer touch and customization, things like that. When I think about branding through the e- commerce supply chain, and porch bandits, I think is they're called, have you had any inquiries or discussion dialog with customers as to kind of dumbing down what might be found on the outside of the box versus depending if it's going through a retail chain or something like that?","Mark Kowlzan","Gabe, I think it's a mixed bag, quite frankly. But I would say the trend is more towards, are customers really interested in protecting their brand and advertising their brand in any way they can. And when you're talking about a, especially just SIAC, as I mentioned, you\u2019re talking about a product not showing on a shelf. So guess where the best place to advertise your product is, on the box. And that fits us very, very well, because as I've said many times, I mean, we're focused on this hard to do, we're very focused on helping our customers grow the business and adding value in any way we can. And, that really is a core competency that we have and we can take to the marketplace and all of our 18,000 plus customers have various needs, when it comes to that kind of value.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] I see that there are no further questions. Do you have any closing comments?","Mark Kowlzan","Yes. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today and we look forward to talking with you in October during the third quarter call. Have a nice day. Bye-bye.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."]}}
