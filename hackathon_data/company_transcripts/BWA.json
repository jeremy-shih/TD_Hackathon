My name is Melissa, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2015 Second Quarter Results Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to Ken Lamb, VP of Investor Relations. Mr. Lamb, you may begin your conference.","Ken Lamb","Thank you, Melissa. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. We issued our earnings release this morning at around 8:00 AM Eastern Time. It\u2019s posted on our website, borgwarner.com, on our Investor Relations home page. A replay of today\u2019s conference call will be available through August 7. The dial-in number for that replay is 800-585-8367. You\u2019ll need the conference ID, which is 42071781 or you can listen to the replay on our website.","With regard to our Investor Relations calendar, we will be attending the following conferences between now and our next earnings release. The JPMorgan Automotive Conference on August 11 in New York, the Credit Suisse Boston Transportation Conference on August 12, the CLSA Auto Conference on September 9 in New York, the RBC Capital Global Industrials Conference on September 10 in Las Vegas and the Morgan Stanley Global Autos and Industrials Conference on September 17 in Laguna Beach, California.","One additional announcement. Going forward, our net new business announcement will be combined with our full-year guidance announcement. And this new combined release will be made in January. Synchronizing the timing of these announcements ensures that our one-year and three-year outlooks will be based on the same program volume, currency and [ph] large timing assumptions, improving the link between them.","Now, back to today\u2019s earnings release. Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties as detailed on our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today.","Now, moving on to our results, James Verrier, President and CEO, will review highlights of our quarterly operating results, as well as some of our recent noteworthy accomplishments. And then Ron Hundzinski, our CFO, will discuss the details of our quarterly results.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to James.","James Verrier","Thank you, Ken, and good day, everybody. Ron and I are very pleased to be with you to review our second quarter results, as well as our recent accomplishments. Before I get into those, let me just take a moment to thank all of the BorgWarner employees around the world for efforts and another good quarter for BorgWarner.","Onto our results. So during the second quarter, reported sales were just over $2 billion. And that\u2019s down 7% from a year ago but up 4% when we exclude the impact of foreign currencies. Our growth in the quarter was below our normal high levels due to a few discreet items that I will discuss in the segment review.","Our U.S. GAAP earnings were $0.65 per share or $0.75 per share when we exclude non-recurring charges. Our operating income margin, again, excluding non-recurring charges was an impressive 12.9% in the quarter. So, when we consider a lower-than-normal growth quarter, some of the restructuring efficiencies that we\u2019re going through, new plants, plant expansions that we\u2019re managing this year, this is very good performance by our operations.","Now, let me talk first about the Engine segment. So, the second quarter sales were about $1.4 billion. That\u2019s down 6% from a year ago, but when we exclude the impact of foreign currencies, the segment grew 7%. And these results were primarily led by strong light vehicle total sales around the world, particularly in Europe, and this was partially offset by some unfavorable mix of light vehicle production in both North America and China and weak commercial vehicle markets around the world.","In the Drivetrain segment, sales were $627 million. That\u2019s down 12% from a year ago or down 3% when we exclude foreign currencies, and the decline in sales for the Drivetrain was related to unfavorable mix of light vehicle production in North America, some launch delays in Asia and also lower light vehicle production in China.","Now, similar to comments in the past three quarters, Drivetrain was impacted by a planned slow ramp-up of a major program by a North American customer in the quarter, and we do expect volumes for this program to return to more normal levels in the second half of 2015.","So, despite the tough year-over-year comps and the challenging environment for growth in the first half, 2015 will be a really good year for Drivetrain and we expect Drivetrain to grow organically in 2015 and the restructuring work that\u2019s under way will position this part of our business for strong growth and margin expansion in 2016 and beyond.","Our financial strength and strong performance is also based on our ability to anticipate and drive the next technology ways. So, as we look to the future, BorgWarner continues to invest for the long term.","Capital spending continues to grow. We spent about 7.3% of sales on capital in the second quarter, and that\u2019s above our long-term target of 5% to 6%. And, typically, our capital spending is primarily from machinery and equipment. However, our strong growth over the next several years does require investments in new plants, plant expansions, which is driving elevated spending in the near term.","We expect this to continue through the end of 2015 after which we should return to more normal spending levels. Our investment in R&D was just under 4% of sales in the quarter, again, in line with our target for the year. The intensity around organic innovation and product development remains very strong.","As Ken said, I\u2019d like to share a few exciting announcements we made during the last few months. First of all, BorgWarner has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Remy International, a global market leading producer of rotating electrical components.","Under the terms of the agreement, BorgWarner will acquire each of the outstanding shares of Remy for $29.50 in cash, which implies an enterprise value of Remy of approximately $1.2 billion. We expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter of 2015.","We produced a number of our advanced engine and drivetrain technologies for the new Great Wall Haval H9. The domestically-produced SUV features BorgWarner engine timing systems, turbochargers and two-speed talk-on-demand transfer case.","BorgWarner\u2019s DCT clutch module helps Eaton\u2019s new Procision seven-speed DCT, which is the first DCT for Class 6 and 7 trucks in North America, improved fuel economy about 8% to 10% compared with similar vehicles with truck converter automatic transmissions.","Our facilities in Bellwood and Frankfort in Illinois received 2014 Certificates of Achievement from Toyota for quality performance. Both facilities achieved 100% quality ratings and zero PPM levels in 2014.","BorgWarner is regulated to two-stage turbocharging technology improves the performance and fuel economy of Ford\u2019s new powerful 2.0-liter diesel engine, the first Ford engine for passenger cars equipped with a two-stage turbo system. The engine will debut in the Ford Mondeo, S-Max and Galaxy in mid 2015 and will replace the 2.2-liter diesel engine. Our manufacturing plant in Seneca, South Carolina was presented with an Excellence in Quality Award from Honda North America. This award recognizing the outstanding product quality in 2014.","Now, let me take a moment to provide an overview of our updated guidance for 2015. Due to the impact of weaker-than-expected market conditions in our business, we have lowered our sales growth expectations for 2015. Our sales growth guidance range is now minus 5.5% at the low end and minus 2.5% at the high end, which is down from the minus 4% to 0% previously.","The change in sales growth guidance is primarily related to three major things; slower light vehicle production growth in China, unfavorable mix of light vehicle production in North America and weak commercial vehicle markets around the world.","Now, when we exclude the impact of currency, base business growth and changes in product pricing, our organic growth is expected to be approximately 7% to 8%. And as a result of the lower sales guidance, we now expect earnings to be within the range of $2.95 to $3.10 per diluted share. That\u2019s down from $3.10 to $3.30 per diluted share. And our operating margin is now expected to be approximately 13% instead of above 13%.","Despite the lower guidance, I\u2019m very encouraged by our outlook for the rest of this year. Our full-year sales guidance implies high-single-digit organic growth in the second half of 2015 and the restructuring and expansion activities are a clear transition to either strong performance in 2016 and beyond.","So, as we look ahead, the industry\u2019s continued adoption of our leading-edge powertrain technology combined with operational excellence are the primary reasons that we\u2019re happy, we still are, and we will continue to be the leading order supplier in terms of growth and operating performance.","So, with that, now, let me turn the call over to Ron.","Ron Hundzinski","Thank you, James, and good day, everyone. Before I begin reviewing the financials, I would like to also commend all of our employees for their hard work in the quarter. Now, on to the financials.","James already provided a detailed review of our sales performance in the quarter. In summary, sales were down 7% from a year ago, or up 4% excluding the impact of foreign currencies. Working down the income statement, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 21.1% in the quarter, down 40 basis points from 21.5% a year ago.","During the same period, SG&A as a percentage of sales was 8.2% in line with last year; R&D spending which is included in SG&A was 3.9% of sales. Operating income in the quarter was $243 million. Excluding $20 million of restructuring charges, operating income was $262 million or 12.9% of sales, down 60 basis points from a year ago; 40 basis points of the decline is in operating margin, was lower in the gross profit margin line item; and 20 basis points was from higher corporate expenses. Our 13.5% operating income margin a year ago was a tough comparison concern. It was an all-time high for this company.","Excluding the restructuring charges previously discussed, as well as the impact of foreign currencies, our year-over-year incremental margin was a negative 7%. In other words, operating income was lower on higher sales. I will discuss this further in the segment review.","As you look further down the income statement, equity in the affiliate earnings was about $11 million in the quarter, down slightly from $12 million last year. This represents our performance of NSK-Warner, our 50\/50 joint venture in Japan with sells transmission components to our Japanese customers in Japan and China, as well as TEL, our turbocharger joint venture in India.","Interest expense and finance charges were $18 million in the quarter, up from $9 million a year ago. The increase is primarily due to the $1 billion of fixed rate senior notes issued in the first quarter. Provision for income taxes in the quarter on a reported basis was $80 million. However, this included unfavorable net tax adjustments of $3 million. You can read about each of these adjustments in our 10-Q which will be filed later today.","Excluding adjustments, provision for income taxes was $77 million which is an effective tax rate of 30% in the quarter. Our year-to-date effective tax rate is 29.5% which is our new estimate for the full year, up from 29% previously. Net earnings attributable to non-controlling interest were just over $9 million in the quarter, basically in line with the second quarter 2014. This line item represents our minority partner share in the earnings performance of our Korean and Chinese consolidated joint ventures.","That brings us back to net earnings which were $148 million a quarter. Net earnings, excluding non-recurring items, were $171 million or $0.75 per diluted share. Note that the weaker foreign currencies lowered earnings by $0.09 per share in the quarter.","Now let\u2019s take a closer look at our operating segments in the quarter. As James said earlier, reported Engine segment sales were about $1.4 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the Engine segment, excluding currency, was 7% compared with the same period a year ago.","On a reported basis, adjusted EBIT was $228 million for the engine segment. Excluding currency, adjusted EBIT was $252 million or 15.7% of sales. Due to the inefficiencies related to the investments in new plant construction and expansion and the Wahler restructuring, adjusted EBIT as a percentage of sales was down 40 basis points from a year ago. And Engine segment\u2019s year-over-year incremental margin was 10%. These results are below our trend, but not unexpected given the level of investment activity within the segment.","Plant construction and expansion currently in progress should be behind us by the end of 2015. And the restructuring plan for Wahler is on target after which we expect Wahler to be a double-digit margin business.","In the Drivetrain segment, reported sales were about $627 million in the quarter. Excluding currency, sales declined about 3% compared with the same period a year ago. On a reported basis, adjusted EBIT was $72 million for the Drivetrain segment. Excluding currency, adjusted EBIT was $76 million or 11.2% of sales. Due to inefficiencies related to investments in the new DCT plant in China and restructuring plant in Europe, adjusted EBIT as a percentage of sales was down 140 basis points from a year ago. And the Drivetrain segment\u2019s year-over-year decremental margin was 53%.","To keep this in perspective, adjusted EBIT declined $13 million on a $24 million decline in sales. If we were to assume a mid-teens decremental margin, you would expect a $4 million decline in adjusted EBIT on a $24 million decline in sales. The $9 million of additional expense is primarily due to investments I just mentioned and slightly elevated from the $5 million to $7 million of investment-related expenses in the previous three quarters.","The Drivetrain restructuring plant and the ramp-up of the new DCT plant in China are both on target. We still expect to have the restructuring plant completed by the end of 2015 and the new DCT plant up and running in early 2016.","The segment review highlights good progress on our restructuring expansion plans. Coming into 2015, we stated these investments would cause near-term inefficiencies. But over the long term, they strengthened our competitive position and performance.","Now, let\u2019s take a look at the balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $319 million of net cash from operating activities in the first six months of 2015, down slightly from $326 million a year ago.","Capital spending was $285 million in the first half of the year, up $28 million from a year ago. Increase was driven by capital required to support our strong backlog of net new business. Free cash flow, which we define as net cash from operating activities less capital spending, was $34 million in the first half of 2015, down from $69 million in the first half of 2014. We expect to generate in a range of $250 million to $300 million of free cash flow in 2015.","Investments in restructuring and expansions that are driving elevated spending will soon be behind us. We expect spending to normalize beginning next year. Also, our realignment plan, which we provide an increase - which provided increased treasury management flexibility will be complete. As a result, we expect to see significant increase in cash availability for corporate initiatives beginning in 2016. We will quantify this improvement and clarify our intentions in the 2016 guidance call in January.","Looking at the balance sheet itself, balance sheet, that increased by $464 million at the end of the second quarter in 2015 compared with the end of 2014. Cash increased by $310 million during the same period. The $154 million increase in net debt was primarily due to capital expenditures given in payments to shareholders and share repurchases.","Our net debt-to-capital ratio was15.6% at the end of the second quarter, up from 12.8% at the end of 2014. Net debt to EBITDA at the end of the year on a trailing - at the end of the quarter at trailing 12 month basis was 0.5 times. Our capital structure remains in excellent shape.","Now, I\u2019d like to discuss our updated guidance for 2015. James reviewed our guidance at a high level. I\u2019ll discuss some of the finer points. We expect sales growth of a negative 5.5% to negative 2.5%, down from 0% to 4%. James described a weaker than expected market conditions that have changed our outlook for the year.","Our full year dollar to euro exchange rate assumption is now $1.10, at the high end of the previous range of $1.05 to $1.10. We now expect EPS within a range of $2.95 to $3.10 per diluted share in 2015. This is down from $2.10 to $3.30 per diluted share previously. The change in EPS guidance is primarily due to the impact of lower expected sales growth.","We spent $25 million on share repurchases in the second quarter and $63 million year-to-date. Our share repurchase activity in the second quarter was slowed by a self-imposed blackout period while working on the Remy transaction.","However, our plan remains unchanged. We still expect to spend $1 billion on share repurchases during the three year period ending in the first quarter of 2018. Our weighted average diluted share count is now expected to be approximately $226 million for 2015, up slightly from $225 million previously.","Our operating income margin guidance is now expected to be approximately 13% instead of above 13%. This implies a mid-teens incremental margin for the full year and high-teens or better incremental margins in the second half.","We continue to be confident in our ability to execute in any market. This company has demonstrated a heightened focus and efficiency in cost. This focus resulted in a high efficient growth and record margins in each of the last four years. With our strong organic growth in operations performing at a very high level, 2015 should be another great year for BorgWarner.","As we look beyond 2015, we intend to execute our growth plan yielding high-single to low-double-digit growth and to efficiently convert our sales growth to profits. The future is great for BorgWarner.","So, with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Ken.","Ken Lamb","Thanks, Ron. Now, let\u2019s move to the Q&A portion of the call. Melissa, please, remind everyone of the Q&A procedure.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Rich Kwas","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","James Verrier","Good morning, Rich.","Ron Hundzinski","Hi, Rich.","Rich Kwas","So, on the guide, the 7% to 8% that corresponds to the 10.3% to 11.5%, that was the original outlook for net new business, is that correct?","James Verrier","Yes, Rich. That is correct.","Rich Kwas","Okay. So, question is I know that you haven\u2019t given the specifics around region this year in your recent guidance updates. But for the second half, what are you assuming for the Chinese light vehicle market? And then when you think about the European landscape, what you have embedded in expectations? Just to get a better understanding of how much second half has been de-risked?","Ron Hundzinski","Yeah. It\u2019s a good question, Rich. So, the way we\u2019re thinking about it is not a lot of change compared to current levels. We don\u2019t have specific market assumptions. The way that we do this is we have our program-level volumes that kind of roll up to our guidance.","As we said at the first quarter call, we were a little bit in revenue compared to what our expectations were. And that happened again in the second quarter for actually different reasons, but that kind of same level is what we\u2019re expecting to see for the rest of the year.","And so, I think we feel pretty comfortable with the guide and where it is right now. We feel that the risks and opportunities to forecast for the guidance is pretty balanced.","Rich Kwas","Okay. And then, in terms of the North American vehicle mix, I know that\u2019s being - in fact, it has been affected by Ford, but what\u2019s the assumption for F-150 in just North American mix in the second half of the year? I mean, is it kind of the normal production increase the schedules suggest at this point or anything noteworthy there?","James Verrier","Yeah, Rich. This is James. I would say no meaningful difference from the North American view to where we were in the last call. So, what we see from IHS and what we hear from the respective OEMs that you were talking about, that\u2019s kind of our view, too, if that makes sense.","So, we\u2019re pretty much consistently in line with pretty much the customers on IHS for North America, which is not a big difference from a quarter ago.","Rich Kwas","Okay. And then, is China - in terms of the China business, apart from the market, it seems like you\u2019re maybe impacted by some key customers over there. I mean, how does that shape up for the balance of the year?","James Verrier","Yeah. Let me talk about that, Rich. Obviously, that\u2019s pretty meaningful for us. We saw - as we went into the second quarter, the light vehicle production rates in China, as we all saw, slowed pretty meaningfully. That\u2019s, as Ken said, is continuing on through the year, so we do see that.","From a BorgWarner-specific point of view, Rich, we\u2019re weighted to the JV Western guys versus the domestics as we sit right now. And it\u2019s fair to say we\u2019re weighted, even within that piece, quite heavily to the large German guy that\u2019s over there. So that, as you can see from some of their commentary, kind of works a little bit against us. And in the short run, we\u2019re probably a little skewed to cars versus SUV trucks.","So from a BorgWarner point of view, yeah, mix is a little bit of a headwind for us. Obviously, looking to the future, that\u2019s fine. We\u2019re still in a good growth environment for China. I think that\u2019s important from a BorgWarner viewpoint. But that growth rate versus where it was at the start of the year is down. That\u2019s the fundamental point, Rich.","Rich Kwas","Okay. All right. Thank you.","James Verrier","Thank you, Rich.","Ron Hundzinski","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Your line is open.","Brian Johnson","Yes. Good morning. Couple of questions. First, vis-\u00e0-vis driveline. You talked last year when you took some cost after restructuring that you\u2019re becoming more competitive and seeing some win rates ideally increase in that unit. Has that - that certainly played out in last year\u2019s backlog, but how is it shaping up with sort of the orders and the backlog as it\u2019s been developing through this year?","James Verrier","Yeah. Brian, this is James. I would say good is the quick answer. We\u2019re very happy, as you know from a Drivetrain perspective, we got two fundamental areas of product in the transmission side and then the all-wheel drive side of our business. And we\u2019ve been very encouraged with the quote win-rate activity and we\u2019re feeling good about that, actually. So, yeah, I don\u2019t want to give any specific numbers. As Ken said, we\u2019ll provide more color at the appropriate time. But good, good is the way to think of it. We\u2019re happy with where we are on Drivetrain.","Brian Johnson","Okay. And the second question and maybe a little bit on the engine as well as the Drivetrain side is we\u2019re certainly very clear that by 2020 number, the upgrades to Powertrains need to happen to meet European and U.S. CAFE requirements aren\u2019t going to go anywhere. What\u2019s now the shape of the ramp in between? And are OEMs at all having second thoughts about potentially pushing, winning a year for our Powertrain program if they can live on CAFE or other credits and not have to get it say in 2017 when you\u2019re making way to 2018. Are those kind of discussions going on? And where do you think those will seek out?","James Verrier","Yeah. Our view, Brian, is no is the real quick answer. We\u2019re not having those discussions. We\u2019re not seeing those discussions. When we - both on the engine and the Drivetrain side, the adoption rate of our technology, we feel very good about. We\u2019re not seeing any slowdown or adjustments.","What you do see in the short run, you\u2019ll see noise in launch delays that we experienced a little bit in the first quarter in Asia. And you can see a little bit of a slow in terms of volume take rates, maybe on a China program.","But in terms of meaningful movement in technology or Powertrain architecture or adoption of our product, no, we\u2019re not seeing any issues. They have very high demand for the product.","Brian Johnson","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is open.","John Murphy","Good morning, guys.","James Verrier","Good morning, John.","John Murphy","Just a first question, it looks like you reduced your free cash flow guidance by about $100 million on the range, but if we look at the earnings reduction based on the EPS, it\u2019s only about a $40 million decline. So, just curious if there\u2019s something else going on in the cash flow or around the working capital or something else that\u2019s going on that we explained that delta $60 million?","James Verrier","No. John, if you\u2019ve taken a look at it, I think it\u2019s in line with the change in earnings. Cash flow changes roughly at the same amount. Yeah.","Ron Hundzinski","Just to put some numbers to that, the free cash flow guidance previously was $300 million to $350 million, and now we\u2019ve changed it to $250 million to $300 million.","John Murphy","Okay. [indiscernible] indeed numbers there. Okay. So, it\u2019s largely in line. Okay. That\u2019s helpful.","Ron Hundzinski","Okay. All right.","John Murphy","And then when we think about all the forex impact here, I mean, we really are looking at pure translation as opposed to anything that\u2019s transactional between regions.","Ron Hundzinski","That\u2019s correct. The headwind is translational on FX, not transactional.","John Murphy","Got you. And then also, if you could just talk about the potential for flexibility in your cost structure as we see increasing [indiscernible] about volume downturns at different regions, although we don\u2019t agree with that, but there is a lot of concern there. I mean, can you just talk about the variability in your cost structure, what kind of actions you\u2019d take if we saw some material declines in volume?","James Verrier","Yeah. I\u2019ll talk about it for a moment, John. A couple of points, I would say, as Ken went around the globe, we see predominant relatively good stability in Europe and good volumes in North America. Probably the one area in the world obviously that got everybody a little nervous is China, and we get that. We\u2019re still in growth mode there. So, for us, our flexibility primarily, John, is around slowing the growth a little bit. So, that\u2019s a better problem than you can imagine.","But we have good amounts of temporary employees in all three major regions of the world. We\u2019re still in good shape. And, actually, if we need to flex on the labor side, and we can obviously flex on the spending side. So, we feel good.","And as we\u2019ve talked about in prior calls, all of the business units and the operating units have got good plans there to adjust if things were to move up or down. So, pretty good shape is the way I would describe it, John.","John Murphy","And last quick question on Remy. Now, that news is out there, any reaction from your customers and positively, negatively? Or what\u2019s been the reaction from your customer base?","James Verrier","Yeah. I would say - the summary, I would say, John, is overwhelmingly positive is kind of what I would share with you. And we\u2019ve talked to a number of our customers, and the general sense we\u2019ve got is a lot of excitement about the technology and particularly the combination of BorgWarner technology with Remy technology. So, very positive.","And I would say that across the landscape, that\u2019s regionally. We got that feedback and it\u2019s across both the commercial vehicle and the light vehicle segments. So, overwhelmingly positive and a lot of good opportunities for us.","John Murphy","Great. Thank you very much.","James Verrier","Thanks, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Patrick Nolan","Hello?","James Verrier","Hey, Rod.","Operator","Rod Lache, your line is open.","Patrick Nolan","Hi, guys. It\u2019s actually Pat Nolan on for Rob.","James Verrier","Hi, Pat.","Ron Hundzinski","Hey, Pat.","Patrick Nolan","So, can you just talk about - I know that the start-up costs are a little bit heavier in Q2. Does that mean for the balance of the year, these costs will be a little bit lower than you thought? And how are you thinking about these costs as - are they 100% eliminated as we go into 2016? So, 2016, you\u2019ll still get your typical on [ph] commercial margin plus these costs going away and any kind of restructuring savings on top of that?","Ron Hundzinski","All right. Pat, so, a couple of things. One is we talked about this quite a bit coming into this cycle. And we said that the cost would be lumpy and it would be, quite frankly, hard to predict if it was going to be $5 million to $7 million or in this quarter, $9 million or if it\u2019s going to be $4 million, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing. This one - this quarter was a little bit higher than we anticipated.","Going forward, we know one thing is going into 2016 is going to be significantly reduced. So that part we do know. And now, we still have two more quarters this year. I would say that we go back in this $5 million, $7 million range. I think this quarter might be on the high side of it. That\u2019s what we\u2019re hoping to achieve rest of the year.","And just to add a little bit to that so the - we have a couple of things going on. The restructuring in Europe, you can expect to see those costs pretty much eliminated as we go in to 2016. There will be a little bit of cost going into 2016, but almost negligible.","Now, on the new plant launch, we\u2019ll start making product there next year, but that\u2019s going to be in a ramp mode, so it\u2019s going to be a while until that plant breaks even...","Patrick Nolan","Right.","Ron Hundzinski","...making money. So, we\u2019re going to have a little bit of a ramp on the new plant, but the restructuring, we should see the benefit eliminated.","Patrick Nolan","Thanks very much. Appreciate it.","Ron Hundzinski","All right, Pat.","James Verrier","[indiscernible], Pat.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Leiker with Baird. Your line is open.","David Leiker","Good morning, everyone.","James Verrier","Hello, David.","Ron Hundzinski","Good morning, David.","David Leiker","I want to circle back on this North American mix side and just try and dig into it at a little bit different perspective. We\u2019re not really hearing that from any other suppliers that there\u2019s a mix issue in North America. I was wondering if you could help us with some color there, whether it\u2019s a particular vehicle or a particular segment or a particular customer that\u2019s causing the issue for you.","Ron Hundzinski","So, let me try and explain this, David. So typically, when mix moves around the way that it has this year, that being passenger cars are down and light trucks are up. It\u2019s usually a relatively neutral event for us. Unless our largest truck customer is in a slow ramp-up in their major truck platform which happens to be our largest one globally,","So, what we\u2019ve seen is whether we normally get that offset on a truck side, when car sales are down, we\u2019re not seeing it as much. Our exposure on passenger cars are to the guys that are seeing some lower volumes this year and our exposure in the truck side is not to the guys that are benefiting from that. If that helps.","David Leiker","Yeah. That makes sense. And then the second item here, as we look at some of the revenue shortfall that we\u2019ve been running in here, some of them are mix-related, some of them are other volumes, some of it end markets. We\u2019re not going to hear an update on what the backlog is for six months here. Can you give us some sense of what you think the impact of that\u2019s going to be on your backlog just from those end market issues?","Ron Hundzinski","Sure. So we talked about that, obviously. It\u2019s an important data point for us and you as well. We at this point think that it\u2019s a bit early to give any indication of how this is going to play out on the backlog. What we can say is if it\u2019s in China, mix and volume kind of stay where they are. It will likely have an unfavorable impact on the backlog. But having said that, that\u2019s a very dynamic market and we\u2019re not at all in a position to say that that\u2019s what we think is going to happen at this point. So give us a little bit of time. We\u2019re going to spend a lot of time looking at this before we come out with our actual guidance for this in January.","David Leiker","Okay. Great. Thank you.","James Verrier","Thanks [indiscernible].","Ron Hundzinski","Thanks, David.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ravi Shanker","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","James Verrier","Good morning, Ravi.","Ravi Shanker","Thanks for the detail here. But I\u2019m certainly a little bit [indiscernible] still understand what\u2019s changed versus your previous outlook from three and six months ago. China, I get. Clearly, that\u2019s changed. But when you consider the lower mix in North America that you just addressed, is it that the F-150 is just a slower ramp than you saw it or why would that be an incremental drag on revenues?","Ron Hundzinski","Okay. So, let\u2019s start back at the beginning of the year because that\u2019s really what we\u2019re comparing to because our guidance didn\u2019t really change after the first quarter.","Ravi Shanker","Right.","Ron Hundzinski","So, what really happened is we expected the program that you\u2019ve mentioned to be in this deliberately slow launch ramp. What we did not expect was the weakness on the passenger car side. That weakness has persisted to the first half of the year. That was unexpected. And as far as the North America piece of what has changed, that\u2019s the major difference from where we were as we talked about this in January.","Ravi Shanker","Okay. Understood. And margin side, Ron, you flagged the number of cost-related issues and launch and restructuring and Wahler and such. Again, so the cut in the margin guidance was driven by the volume decline or is there anything else going on?","Ron Hundzinski","All by the volume decline. The sales decline on the guidance update is what\u2019s driving the updated EPS guidance.","Ravi Shanker","Okay. I guess what I\u2019m getting at is, are you seeing any weakness at all and just decrease for - in the turbo engines versus the non-turbo engines? I mean, apart from just a fast car versus truck shift, are you seeing a move away from some of the more fuel-efficient technologies towards less fuel-efficient technologies given gas prices and what\u2019s the view on the medium term?","James Verrier","Yeah. Ravi, this is James. No is the quick answer to be candid. We\u2019re not seeing any shifts in those types of specific product mix, particularly in North America. And the desire and the take rate and the opportunity for turbo in North America remains very strong. So, no, we\u2019re not seeing any shifts there.","Ravi Shanker","Great. Thank you for the color.","James Verrier","Thanks, Ravi.","Ron Hundzinski","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.","Brett Hoselton","Good morning, James, Ron, Ken.","James Verrier","Good morning.","Ron Hundzinski","Good morning, Brett.","Brett Hoselton","I was hoping that you could provide maybe a sense of what you\u2019re thinking in terms of China. I know that you\u2019ve already talked about your production expectations or kind of relatively levels from current levels, I think, through the remainder of this year. I think that\u2019s really what you said. I guess what I\u2019m wondering is obviously we\u2019ve seen a slowdown in the sales rate in China here in June in particular. Delphi was out just before you kind of talking about customers adding to the production schedules in the fourth quarter and third quarter being up maybe about 3% on a year-over-year basis. So, I guess, where do you think is taking place in China in terms of the slowdown in sales, slowdown in production? And what gives you confidence that it\u2019s going to remain roughly flat? And do you have any bias to the upside or downside and why?","James Verrier","Yeah. I would articulate it this way, Brett. I think that - first of all, I think to put things in perspective, what we\u2019re talking about again is we\u2019re still growing and growing well in China for BorgWarner. So, that\u2019s an important reference perspective. But, obviously, as you say, the growth from where we started out the year in terms of our expectation has slowed.","Q2 had moved very quickly as I alluded to earlier. And we feel comfortable with what our assumptions are right now in the guidance, which is pretty much continuing on at the level of the pace of run rates, so to speak, that we\u2019re at. It\u2019s a little less granularity of data in China when you compare it to, say, North America, so there is.","Is there potential upside? Maybe. Is there potential downside? Yeah. My personal view is probably if there was a bias, it\u2019s probably slightly weighted to the down versus the up based on what we see. Some of that also, Brett, maybe specifically to BorgWarner.","We talked earlier before. We have large concentrations with the two leading joint ventured Western guys out there. So, that\u2019s meaningful. We talked a lot about in the press release about Great Wall being a major customer for BorgWarner. And we see some issues there. So, we\u2019re comfortable with where we\u2019re at.","We\u2019re still happy with the growth rate that we\u2019ve got, but it\u2019s a little lower than when we started the year. And as we look beyond 2015, which I think is important, we\u2019re very positive on China. And we see the strong growth in China, and we see very strong adoption rates to the technology in China.","Brett Hoselton","And as I look at your guidance, again, the sales clearly on a year-over-year basis are improving in the back half of the year. So you\u2019re down 6% in the first half, down 2% in the back half to get to a 4% midpoint of your guidance. And again, that is the midpoint. But your margin expectation seems to be kind of flat going from the first half to the back half. And I\u2019m kind of thinking about some of the positives that may take place in the back half.","And I\u2019m thinking that the margins possibly should have shown maybe a little bit of improvement sequentially from the first half to the second half. They have in previous years. What is it that\u2019s kind of driving that kind of flat margin expectation into the back half of the year?","Ron Hundzinski","Well, one thing I like to point out, Brett, is that I think the midpoint the sales are actually down in the second half over the first half of the year on a reported basis. Slightly it is, but they are down. So you\u2019re going to have obviously a reduction in margins and everything remained the same.","I would say this, we changed our guidance from above 13 to approximately 13. We were talking within 10, 20 basis points of movement here, okay. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s significant. I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s anything into that we\u2019re concerned about or anything like that. Is it possible our margins could still expand, yes, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything significant or be concerned about in your analysis that you\u2019re doing right there.","Brett Hoselton","Okay. That\u2019s fair enough, Ron. Thank you very much, gentlemen.","James Verrier","All right, Brett.","Operator","Your next question comes from Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Patrick Archambault","Hi. Yes. Good morning. Just actually, I wanted to follow up on that question. Can we just put in the context that your new organic growth is 7 to 8? And I haven\u2019t done the math, but what was the organic in the first and second quarter? And what exactly is implied in the back half? Can we just go through that real quick?","James Verrier","No. We\u2019re not going to be able to go through that real quick. We\u2019re going to have to do that when offline, Pat. We can give you that, though, Pat, but it\u2019s a complete walk as you know, right? That would take us some time to go through that complete walk.","Patrick Archambault","Okay. But I think you were 4%, right, this quarter and you were something similar, right, I think in the first quarter...","James Verrier","Yes.","Patrick Archambault","...assuming that\u2019s correct, right? So, call it...","James Verrier","Yes.","Patrick Archambault","...like mid-single digits in the first half even if we don\u2019t have the exact numbers. So, it does imply kind of an organic growth acceleration in the second half?","James Verrier","Yes.","Patrick Archambault","And so that was really the crux of the question is - I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot of stuff you could point to like the F-150 launch and everything like that. But I just wanted to go through the line items that are relevant there in driving that pickup in the growth rate in the second half?","Ron Hundzinski","Pat, I can\u2019t tell you at a very high level and then, obviously, we\u2019ll walk you through that later on. You were right, the first half organic was roughly 4%. It does accelerate in the second half year approaches, I think, between 7% to 8% organic growth. This is on a year-over-year comparable basis. So, at a high level, those are the numbers.","Patrick Archambault","And then just to follow up like the main levers that you guys see to get to that acceleration. I\u2019m sure a lot of those are just timing of launches and things like that. But I wanted to specifically kind of hear that from you and kind of get a sense of what those are.","Ron Hundzinski","So, we\u2019ll talk about it generally, Pat. Generally, we do see some pickup in the backlog in the second half versus the first half. And obviously, that North American program picking up steam is helpful in that regard. And secondly, the comps are [ph] easier in the second half. This is a big variable when you\u2019re thinking about this. So, those are kind of the two main pieces.","Patrick Archambault","Okay. And then China was brought up a lot here, and I understand that you guys do everything sort of rolled up from an individual program perspective. So, it\u2019s not just as easy as saying the market\u2019s going to do X or Y. But Delphi actually put out pretty helpful dimensions. They were saying up, and I\u2019m probably getting this wrong, but I think they thought production as they saw what\u2019s going to be up 3% in the third quarter, just based on the schedule [indiscernible] for the market and then up 6% for the fourth is what I think what they had as a best guess and at a high level, just given you have a lot in China as well. Wanted to see if you were seeing something [indiscernible].","James Verrier","Well, first of all, we\u2019re not disputing what anybody else says about their expectations for the market in China. The reason that we don\u2019t provide that information is because, as you see in our business, the mix issue is significant and those particular figures are not as important to us as what our particular programs are doing in that market. So, that may be true what they said, but by and large, what we\u2019re looking at are the customers and the programs that James alluded to earlier because that\u2019s what\u2019s really driving our expectations for the second half.","And just for clarity, when we talked about kind of flattish expectations for our business in China in the second half versus the first, that was BorgWarner-specific. That wasn\u2019t a volume number that we were giving for the market overall. That was for us.","Patrick Archambault","Okay. Got it. And I\u2019m sorry. I should like - I know you guys have probably clarified this, but that flat, is that kind of the volume underlying the organic revenue? Was that actually the revenue forecast for you guys?","James Verrier","It\u2019s a general description of how we feel about our business in China in the second half versus the first half.","Patrick Archambault","Got it. Okay. And then, last one, I promise. And you probably just gave this, but like the - I understand VW is a big program and kind of the international guys. What\u2019s - sorry, what\u2019s the percentage of them in your China portfolio versus the domestic guys?","James Verrier","We would - I would just say we are weighted - we\u2019re certainly weighted right now to the joint venture in Western guys, Pat. And the biggest piece of that joint venture Western piece is that large German customer you referenced.","Patrick Archambault","Okay. And to push my luck here...","James Verrier","We got to move on to the next person. Thank you.","Patrick Archambault","I\u2019ll let you go.","James Verrier","Thanks.","Ron Hundzinski","All right. Thanks, Pat.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ryan Brinkman","Hi. Thanks for taking my call. Good morning.","James Verrier","Good morning, Ryan.","Ron Hundzinski","Hi, Ryan.","Ryan Brinkman","Just one on China, a bit about the backlog there. First of all, you stood it out by overall region, but can you say how much is China? I think it\u2019s most of Asia Pacific. And then secondly, is there any risk that automakers could look to delay new program launches to save money like they did in Europe, which impacted you in 2012 and 2013? I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any risk of the automakers that I cover, not refreshing the products according to plan. But GM did on their call this quarter talk about the ability to pull back on capacity expansion if they needed to. And I was wondering maybe if product launch delays are an emerging trend that automakers that I don\u2019t follow closely.","James Verrier","So when we had provided our backlog announcement this past November, we [overlapping conversation] American piece of what has changed, that\u2019s the major difference from where we were as we talked about this in January.","Ravi Shanker","Okay.

Maybe a rough range of what it looks like.","James Verrier","It\u2019s a high-content vehicle for us, okay?","Patrick Archambault","Okay. [indiscernible] with that. All right. Great.

We encourage you to follow along with these charts during the discussion our results.","With that, I will turn it over to James.","James Verrier","Thank you, Ken. And welcome to everybody. Thanks for joining the call today. Ron and I will spend a little bit of time with you going through Q1 2016 and then obviously we'll get in share with some of our thoughts around the outlook for the rest of the year. So you can see on Slide 2 let's start there and let me give you some our perspective on some of the bigger picture issues little bit around the macro-environments and then the industry in general. I think the headline for us as we look at the macro in the industry. This as we know there is a lot of uncertainty out there in the world and whether that's Federal Reserve issues, China monetary policy, oil Middle East the list is pretty extensive and we do see a general tone of uncertainty in the general macro-environment.","That said our view is all those are relatively stable and I'll get into more color on that. So we see an unstable macro, but all those are in pretty good shape actually. If I take that down a little further and talk more specifically about our view on the market, I'll start with the light vehicle view and we will continue to remain pretty plus realign with IHS as we've done through the year actually. So that points us to a projection for 2016 light vehicle growth in Europe of about 2%, North America around 4%, China somewhere around 5% to 6%. So we continue to share a similar set of views to those of IHS. If I switch over to commercial vehicle which is obviously a key market for BorgWarner, we still see that very challenge, we\u2019re not seeing a lot of uplifting news frankly speaking on the environment around commercial vehicle.","On a macro, global level growth is really very little if any and one of the evolution I would say in the commercial vehicle space is we do see some of the new programs that were targeted for the out years coming into a little of question and review and so we're paying a lot of attention to that. As we look out into 2016 from a high level perspective, on the last call I wanted to alert you to the areas of watch that we're paying attention to as we continue to move forward in the year and I'd like refresh what we're watching and paying a lot of attention to commercial vehicle I already alluded to, the second area where we're watching and paying a lot of attention to is China and particularly what we mean by China is, I think we all benefited from some good tailwinds around the incentives that were put in place at the end of 2015 and we're paying attention to how that evolves particularly into the second half of the year.","So what that means is are we seeing any path forward in the first half of the year or do we see continued strength from the incentives, and I would say there is some questions there. Specifically, from the BorgWarner point of view we're paying attention to I would say China and Europe relatively to our biggest German-based customer and how that may play out as the years unfolds. And then I think like all of our -- we're going to pay a lot of attention to inventory builds and inventory building schedules in North America. So those are just some of the areas, with that said things have gone well for us well so far and we're optimistic and positive about our guidance for the year but there are some watch points and I think it's prudent of us at least share with you what those watch points are from our view points.","Still on the same slide, let me reference some of areas that maybe of interest for you around the regulatory and technology trend area. We continue to see a strong drive for fuel economy and emissions regulations that are pulling our powertrain technology programs. I would articulate so the group here on the call the intensity we see around product development activity, innovation activity is at least at the same level and potentially probably a little higher than it was several months ago around technology for fuel economy and emissions. So I just wanted to point that out we're not seeing any slowdown if anything we're seeing a little bit more work around meeting fuel economy and emission standards for powertrain technology.","We've engaged in some meaningful dialogue in the last quarter directed with the EPA and our view of the world is that we have not anticipating meaningful change to the 2025 CapEx standards. That's not to say that maybe some minor adjustments and clearly the process that\u2019s to play out with further discussion, but our view at this stage is we're not seeing meaningful change. Just like other suppliers in the space and the OEMs that you talk to, the transition to electrification of the powertrain continues to evolve and I would accelerate. We noticed that a couple of years ago and we've see that trend playing out and we continue to see that intensify. Clearly for BorgWarner right in the middle of the that electrification evolution and whether that's 12-volt, 48-volt hybrid EVs, we see a lot of activity around many different architectures and I would say to the group here not just for the long-term 7 or 8 years out, but we're seeing meaningful evolution in that space in the next 2 to 3 years, so more to come on that in my later comments.","I also wanted just to anecdotally mention as this electrification trend continues, I know one of the hot buns for the Company is how does play out for you from electric vehicle. We talked on the last call that we were very proud of our EV transition program with Remy that will run at somewhere around by 15,000 units in 2016. I can tell you we've been awarded two additional electric vehicle programs for the company. I'm not in a position to announce the details today, we need to work with our customers to get that, but those announcements will be coming out in the next few months and we view them as significant in how we will play in that space.","Finally around the regulatory technology area let me make a couple of comments around diesel, I know that's on people's minds. I would say it\u2019s a similar story to what I shared with you in February. We're not really seeing any meaningful mix shifts at this point we do know and we believe that the diesel gas mix will slowly evolve and shift a little more to gas over the next couple of years, I think that's consistent with others viewing the space. We see that as a somewhat neutral event for BorgWarner as that technology continues to get adopted to the gasoline products at a similar level to diesel.","Let me shift from the macro and the industry perspective and give you a little bit of a snapshot of, from a BorgWarner viewpoint. First of all let me start with Q1 and obviously Ron will give you a lot more color and details in his commentary. But I would tell you from my seat I was very pleased with our Q1, I think we delivered some good growth, a little bit above expectation which was good to see and as you'll see in the details a very strong operating performance across the segments. So I went into the quarter feeling good, I come out of the quarter feeling very good. It was a good solid quarter for us. Versus our expectations the revenue I would say on a regional basis, China was -- China played out about as we had expected overall, Europe a little lower than what we had expected and I can give a little bit of commentary on that later and North America and Korea a little better than we had expected. But no meaningful big shift, it was just little bit of nuancing and overall that led to a good quarter.","That quarter totaled up to 2.3 billion in sales which when we exclude FX and Remy that's about 4.5% growth. The EPS of $0.80 which includes the non-comparable it does of course include Remy and our operating margin of 12.2% again for comparable thoughts when we exclude Remy on the core business for BorgWarner it was 13.2%, strong performance. If I break that down a little further by segment engine came in at 1.4 billion which grew at 1% as reported or 4.5% when we exclude currency. Primary drivers of the growth, good growth in engine with turbo and VCT Variable Cam Timing on the engine timing side of our business. Our drive train sales 879 million, that's up an impressive 44% but obviously we get the benefit of Remy, when we exclude Remy and currency we grew at 5% in the drive train segment. That was primarily driven by very good all-wheel drive sales in North America and also in Europe.","So again good quarter, as we look out for 2016, you'll see that we did tweak our guidance just a little for the full year, but generally it's pretty much unchanged and I'll let Ron give the necessary detail around there. I did want to comment on the Wahler restructure because you see that in some of our walks as it comes up. I want to say this I think the Wahler transaction we did strategically we feel very positive about it still, it was -- we're very comfortable with the technology we're comfortable with the customer reaction, customer were pleased with the growth. The restructuring element of it is taking longer than what we had anticipated and that's a little frustrating from a BorgWarner viewpoint. Let me just maybe give a high level summary of why that is so you have a sense.","What it really is, it centers around our European facilities, the Asia and South America and North America are doing great actually. The European piece, we're in the process of having to make a lot of product moves, we're closing the plant, we're opening the plant, we're building the plant up and there is multiple moves of products as part of the restructuring with our customers, it's taking a little longer than we'd anticipated but we're going to come through it and get back on track with Wahler. So our adjusted guidance does reflect a little less tailwind then expected for Wahler, but as you can see we didn't change the total company margin or EPS guidance. I also want to share my view a little bit on as we look to the second half of the year and maybe some, I think what I would say to you is we have opportunities and we have risks, I would say the risks a little outweigh the opportunities as we see the world at this point. ","And let me maybe share what I see those as. You know I mentioned earlier that China, second half of the year, we do have a little bit of angst that some of that incentive benefits that we're getting is being potentially pulled into the first half, and as you know our back half for the year is very heavily weighted to a lot of launches particularly in Q3 and some of those are very significant and we see a little bit of risk there. And commercial vehicle is kind of little bit hard to read, it's hard to imagine it getting much worse than what it is but we do pay attention to that. And I think the last comment I would make relative to the risk to the second half is our largest German based customer and is there additional risk there in China and Europe from a market share pressure point of view.","So we've reflected that into our guidance we believe that's the right thing to do, that's the prudent thing to do. But I do want to be very clear, I'm very comfortable and I'm very confident about reiterating our ability to achieve our full year guidance. We're off to a good start and we'll deliver on our full year guidance. And that guidance of course is a good mid-single digit growth and strong operating performance.","Let me just share couple of highlights around growth that you can see on the screen. First of all Remy, the Remy deal, I would say the high level -- the integration is actually going well for us and I would say to you financially and operationally we're performing about as expected which is pretty good. The reaction from our customers around the technology is very positive. We have multiple customers already engaged in discussion around not just the core Remy business, starters, alternators, belt alternator-starter systems, but a lot of activity, a lot of discussion, a lot of quoting activity around the combination production. And I would point you to the largest part of that, is our activity about the combination of the formal Remy motor, the BorgWarner clutching system, the hydride vehicles. Some of you on the call may that know as the P2 hybrid architecture, we feel very positive about where we stand on that position and more to come on that.","Away from the Remy integration, I will tell you the quotes and our booking activity remain strong and solid very much in line with our growth expectations, so we feel good about our win rates, we feel good about the actual overall quoting activity and all that building up nicely for our future growth. And I said earlier the intensity around the electrification continues and BorgWarner is right in the middle of that. So if wrap up with that and summarize before I turn it up Ron, we're up to a good start to the year, really good solid Q1. The business is running well. We continue to be heavily focused on driving our growth through adoption of technology and we're up beat and confident about our delivery our full year guidance.","So with that let turn the call over to Ron who can provide more color and detail around the financials.","Ron Hundzinski","Thank you, James, and good day, everyone. Before I review the financials detail, I would like to provide you some of the financial highlights as I see them for the quarter. As James said, we have experienced expected sales growth for the quarter. We also expanded our free margins on a comparable basis and we flowed through that additional sales, but more importantly for me on the cash side we saw return to normal CapEx spending. So now as Ken mentioned I will be referring to the supplemental financial slide deck as we posted on the IR website, so I do encourage you to follow along.","So let's start on Slide 3, on a reported basis which includes the change in sales due to market growth price, net new business, FX and Remy that's a mouthful by the way, segments were up 14.3%; however, to get a clear picture of how the core business performed, we have to exclude the impact of FX and Remy. So when you exclude those items, sales were up 4.5% which was above the high end of our guidance range. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 20.5% in the quarter. On a comparable basis or excluding Remy, gross margin was 20.9% which is down 70 basis points from last year caused by plant startups and borrowed restructuring inefficiencies as James talking about earlier.","SG&A as a percentage of sales was 8.3% but on a comparable basis SG&A was 7.8% of sales or 70 basis points improvement from a year ago. The Company did a good job of executive cost controls to offset the gross margin decline. R&D spending, which is including in SG&A was flat from a year ago at 3.8% in sales; however, if you do exclude Remy engineering was at 4.2% or actually a 30% increase in absolute spend.","Now let's look at the year over year comparison for operating income which can be found on Slide 4. Starting on the right fourth quarter 2016 operating income adjusted for non-comparable items but including Remy was 276 million or 12.2% of sales. Excluding Remy's $11 million of net contribution to operating income, operating income was 266 million or 13.2% of sales and that's up 10 basis points from a year ago. Excluding non-comparable items Remy and FX operating income was up 14 million and $90 million in other sales and that gives us the incremental margin of 15% in the quarter.","Now, I would like to pause for a second and point out that there is a reconciliation of reported operating income or GAAP basis to operating income adjusted for non-comparable items plus Remy and can be found on Slide 15, this is very important and that is GAAP reported different there. Now I can move.","As we look further down in the income statement, equity and affiliate earnings was about 9 million in the quarter which is up slightly from last year. Interest expense and finance charges were 21 million in the quarter, up from 10 million a year ago and this increase is primarily due the $1 billion and \u20ac500 million fixed rate seniors notes issued in the first and third quarters of 2015 respectively.","Provision for income taxes in the quarter, on a reported basis was 80 million. However, this included 1 million tax benefits associated with our non-comparable charges plus an additional 1 million favorable tax adjustment. You can read about each of these adjustments in our 10-Q which will be filed later today. So if we exclude those items the provision for income taxes was $82 million for an effective tax rate of 31% and I should note this is up from our guidance of 30%. Net earnings attributable to non-controlling interest were about 9 million in line with the first quarter of 2015.","Let's take a look at our diluted earnings per share on Slide 5. Net earnings excluding non-comparable items but including Remy was $0.80 per diluted share. For comparisons with prior periods net earnings excluding non-comparable items and Remy was $0.77 per diluted share.","Now let's take a closer look at our operating segments in the quarter, begin on Slide 6 of the deck. Reported income for the -- I'm sorry reported engine segment net sales were just under 1.4 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the engine segment excluding currency was 4.5% compared to same period a year ago, primarily due to higher turbo charger and variable cam timing systems.","Turning to Slide 7, adjusted EBIT was 233 million for the engine segment or 16.7 % of sales excluding currency, the engine segment's adjusted EBIT was up 10 million on 63 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 15%.","Turning to Slide 8 and starting from the right drive train segment net sales were 879 million for the quarter. Excluding Remy and FX sales growth for the drive train segment was 4.8% compared to same period a year ago primarily due to higher all-wheel drive sales. ","Now on Slide 9, adjusted EBIT was 84 million for drive train segment or 9.5% of sales reported, but it exclude Remy adjusted EBIT was 11.7% of sales which is up 10 basis points from the prior year. Excluding Remy and FX, the drive train segment adjusted EBIT was up 5 million and $30 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 15%. Now let's take a look at our balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $35 million of net cash from operating activities in the first quarter which is typically our lowest quarter for cash flow. Our investment in working capital ramps up for the first quarter to match higher levels of business activity compared with end of the year. Capital spending was a $104 million in the first quarter down from a $140 million a year ago. Capital spending was above the trend in 2015, but we are returning to normal spending levels of 5% to 6% of sales this year. ","Free cash flow which we define as net cash from operating activities less capital spending was an outflow of 69 million in the first quarter. That's a $38 million improvement from a year ago. Again this is a typical seasonal occurrence. We still expect to generate between 400 million and 475 million of free cash flow in 2016. At the mid-point that's up 50% from 2015. 200 million to 300 million of this free cash flow will be used to repurchase shares in 2016.","Looking at the balance sheet itself, balance sheet debt increased by 48 million and cash decreased by 185 million in the first quarter compared with the end of 2015. The 233 million increase in net debt was primarily due to investments in working capital and share repurchases. We spent $80 million repurchasing 2.1 million shares in the first quarter, ahead of schedule for executing an expected 200 million to 300 million of share repurchases this year.","Our net debt to net capital ratio was 37% at the end of the first quarter. That's up from 35.2% at the end of 2015. The net debt to EBITDA at the end of the year on a trailing 12 month basis was 1.5 times. Now I like to discuss our 2016 guidance which is slightly modified from our initial announcement.","Returning to the slide deck, let's start with our sales growth guidance for the full year on Slide 10. Note that the baseline of 2015 net sales excluding Remy which was just under 7.9 billion. All in we expect growth between 12.7% and 17.5% which is down slightly from 13.2% to 18.3%. This change is primarily due to lower growth expectations from Remy's commercial vehicle business. We're seeing the same effect in Remy and commercial vehicle we're seeing in our core business. Currency is unchanged and net new business pricing and market related growth is also unchanged at 2.5% to 5.5%.","Looking at our operating income guidance on Slide 11, from an operating performance perspective we are expecting 16% to 18% incremental margins on our core business sales growth which is slightly down from our previously guide of 18% to 20%.","The change is due to slower progress of the Wahler restructuring as James mentioned earlier in this remarks. Our previous guide included $8 million tailwind from Wahler restructuring this year which is has been reduced to 3 million. On a comparable basis we still expect our operating income margin to be 13% or greater. And as including Remy our operating income margins still expect to be around the 12% range.","Now on Slide 12, we have our EPS guidance we still expect earnings of $3.11 to $3.32 per share on a consolidated basis which includes about $0.12 per share from Remy. Excluding Remy we now expect earnings to be $2.99 to $3.19 per share.","Now let's review of effective quarter guidance issue this morning starting with the sales growth on Slide 13. All-in we expect to grow between 10.6% and 16% in the quarter including about 12 percentage point due to Remy. Excluding Remy our growth in the quarter is expected to be between minus 1.5% to be positive 3.8%, but includes a negative impact of currency. Currency is expected to over sales by 290 basis points at the low end and 100 basis points on the high end. So if excludes Remy in currency the impact of net new business pricing and market related growth would drive growth between 1.5% to 4.5% in Q2.","Now turning to Slide 14, we expect earnings of $0.78 to $0.83 per share on a consolidated basis in the second quarter which includes about $0.03 per share from Remy. Excluding Remy we expect earnings to be $0.75 to $0.80 per share. I would like to make a few concluding remarks, we had a good first quarter. Sales growth exceeded our expectations and we flowed this through to our operating income.","But more importantly the first half of 2015 was a challenging year for us and we were having a difficult time setting our sales guidance because of the market index in that we have in BorgWarner and as a result this impacted earnings expectations last year, however, over the last three quarters we have settled this down and we have achieved our sales and earnings expectations. So as we look at the rest of the year, we expect to continue on this path solid sales growth, strong operating margins and improved cash flow for a year. I remain confident that we will deliver our 2016 guidance similar to as James expressed earlier.","And with that, I will like to turnover call back to Ken.","Ken Lamb","Thanks Ron. We're now going to move to the Q&A portion of the call. Melissa, please remind everyone of the Q&A procedures.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Rich Kwas","James following up on your comments regarding risk and opportunities and more risks here maybe versus 60 to 90 days ago, if we look at first quarter you came in better on organic growth versus your initial expectation, you didn\u2019t change the full year organic growth rate, but is it fair to say that you've taken some of these incremental risk into account through the second half of the year as it relates to the items you cited earlier?","James Verrier","Yes, it's a good way to think about it Rich. Yes that is the good way and that\u2019s kind of the way I thought it would be useful to at least let you know what some of them could be, we're not necessarily saying that it will happen, but we just thought it was prudent and it does get back a little bit through to China, story a little you know that we've seeing some acceleration in the first half on these incentives that made way a little bit on the backend.","Clearly, we have the Volkswagen business with China particularly and Europe for the market share risk point of view and just on that one Rich as an example we saw some of that way on us in the first quarter with China -- in Volkswagen in China. You can see the numbers. They were down in the production pretty significantly in the first quarter and still 20 plus percent of that business.","So I mean the last Rich is we got some pretty big launches which we talked about on the prior calls with us penned to start with the super duty the Duramax and so. These are all -- I would say, these are kind of pretty small nuance and things, it's not big but when we add all of those up, we just see slightly skewed to the risk side than the opportunity side. We just think it\u2019s prudent reflect that and then play it from there.","Rich Kwas","And then in North America inventory appear to be elevated here and we need some real descent flow through on the sale side over the next few months to justify that IHS number that you've referenced, what are you seeing on schedules at this point here in North America and it doesn't seem like you've factored in much on the North American front on the back half, but just curious on how you see things potentially playing out here?","James Verrier","You're right Rich, that one we didn't reflect into our numbers in the back half of the year. We pretty much left that alone. I think what we're seeing is largely what you do, you know builds are -- you know the first quarter came in where it did. I think everybody's kind of looking at the second quarter as a kind of key one in terms of where we're stacking between production builds and inventory levels and that's going to give us a -- for me I think it's a pretty key quarter across all the OEMs.","Generally, we're seeing build rates pretty good in general Rich, we're seeing not a whole lot of volatility, they're coming out pretty much as we'd anticipated. So we're not seeing I would just -- and that's why we didn't do anything with the back half guidance Rich. We left it alone. It's just an area like you and all of us were just paying attention and I think we'll get a little bit of a better readout to when we can look at the second quarter data and see what went on with the inventory and what went on with the production build. But we need the production builds to stay pretty strong and so far I would say they're holding pretty good and they hold like that we should be okay. Which is why we didn't adjust the back half.","Rich Kwas","And then just last one, thanks James by the way. And this is the last one, Ron, I think it was referenced that Europe was maybe a little bit below expectation and I don't recall if you said exactly why maybe it was Volkswagen share, but what was -- volumes are coming better at least so far for 2016, just curious on what drove the [indiscernible]?","Ron Hundzinski","It was -- we're just trying to get most of them and get actually for what it\u2019s -- we see Europe running pretty well in general. If you recall Rich in the fourth quarter and we had some transmission programs that we\u2019re running out and so you get a little bit of that noise flows through as those programs run off, and we did see a little bit of transmission build adjustment on VW which I obviously talked about. We saw a little bit of, little bit of share challenge from a VW perspective so that was, I mean it was a little lower than what we wanted, it wasn\u2019t a big number but there was a little bit of noise there and each -- those are the two big ones Rich, VW and transmission roll offs, those are the two for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc, your line is open.","Brett Hoselton","I wanted to kind of take a step back and just ask a longer term conceptual question, you've obviously provided the backlog guidance of 4% to 6% through 2018, my question is this. As you kind of looked that backlog number that growth number, ideally how should we think about kind of upside versus downside. Upside opportunity versus downside risk and then secondly as you look out beyond that three year time horizon is that a pace that you anticipate maintaining or would it -- is it likely to decelerate or accelerate?","James Verrier","That\u2019s a great thought -- let me take a shot at it okay. So first thing I would say, we're in the first year of the net new business and that's where we're communicating. We're comfortable, confident and feeling pretty good about this year okay. So that's what we think. As we look out, I'm going to say a couple of things. Are we comfortable internally as a company with the projection we made? Yes. Do we like it? Not really. I'd rather be much higher than 4% to 6% and we're working like crazy to get higher than 4% to 6% and as we get through this year we'll have a better read on what that looks like, and obviously we need a little bit more time.","So our focus right now is we're comfortable with what's out there. We're going to execute and perform against which I think we're starting to do, which is really good. And I would say incrementally as I look out we will go up from mid-single digit growth at some point if not yet. That's kind of the way to think of it Brett, we will. And I don't anticipate that. It's certainly not '16 and I don't yet think it would be '17 either. I want you to know BorgWarner is not happy being a mid-single digit growth company. We're going to go -- we're not, we're going to focus like crazy to go higher than that. But it's too early Brett, we got to deliver and we got to execute on the mid-single digit growth. I think the Investor Day will, that's later this year will help provide some clarity and color on why we believe there is opportunity to transition up. But it is too early at this point Brett, we need a little more time to execute, deliver and do our work.","Brett Hoselton","Okay, fair enough, and then switching gears, thank you James. As we think about M&A activity obviously you're digesting Remy and fairly large acquisition for you. As you kind of think about M&A activity should we think about it as kind of subsiding for another, for the next quarter or two, three, four quarters till you digest what you've bitten off so far, or can we expect maybe some additional bolt-on through the remainder of this year into next year?","James Verrier","I think, you're right Brett. Priority one really is flawless execution on the Remy deal which I'm pleased with how that's going. You know from a financial perspective you know we feel comfortable if another deal came along, we could do it and we would do it. So I don\u2019t feel too inhibited from a smaller size bolt-on acquisition, I'm pretty comfortable there, and I think from a resource perspective we feel comfortable. So what I am saying to you is we're not slowing down our efforts to look at smaller bolt-on related deals whether it would be this year or next year, you always know that's kind of hard to predict the accurate timing, but I wouldn't wind you to think or anybody to think that we've done Remy, that\u2019s all we\u2019re doing and we've stopped kind of looking and working and talking about deals because that's not the case. We are, they would be clearly smaller than obviously the Remy transaction and they would be likely bolt-on complementary type technologies to what we have. So if that helps you Brett, that's where we're thinking.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Chris McNally","Thanks so much, guys. This is Chris McNally. It seems like the first half this you're on a pretty good track to execute your new plan, on the second half comments I am just very curious, you didn't mention mix and that's one of the areas of that everyone is trying to figure out, particularly in North America. Sedan production schedules sort of moving down replaced by rising truck, could you just walk through how that may affect numbers or particularly some of the programs you're associated with?","James Verrier","Yes, sure, this is James again, Chris. As I mentioned earlier Chris, we've not really done anything relative from a guidance perspective to reflect any meaningful shift in North America. As I alluded to earlier, it is watch point for us more fundamentally inventory and production ratios as opposed to car-truck mix, if that helps you. I would say if let's say second half of the year, trucks stays a little bit stronger. It's probably a little bit favorable for BorgWarner, but it's not a big shift for us, we generally get a little better if its truck weighted versus car weighted. But it's not a big more for us, if that helps us.","Chris McNally","And any specific program within truck that we should pay attention to whether for launches or just the largest amount of content or incremental margin?","James Verrier","We have a lot of attraction for the F150.","Ron Hundzinski","And the super duty launch.","Operator","Your next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning everyone. This is [Indiscernible] standing in for Adam Jonas. Just a couple of questions and apologies if this has been address earlier, but in the past you've highlighted how Remy has a narrow band of customers and you're planning to leverage your relationships with existing BorgWarner customers especially in Europe, how have those conversations evolved in the past few months?","James Verrier","I would articulate it this way, think of it in two way, the core ex-Remy business starters, alternators, et cetera, and we're engaged in those conversations with customers that as of today have not in the past years from a Remy product and those conversations are going on, we're only a few months in. But I would say the opportunity for us is good, I mean we've served a lot of customers that Remy didn't, it's a little early to know how that's going to translate into revenue, we need a little more time. But I would articulate the conversations have been open and productivity and good thus far.","As I alluded and mentioned in my opening comment already, the energy intensity excitement around the combination of products and future technology packages combining former BorgWarner is as probably exceeded our expectation from when we did the deal. As we've already said that\u2019s a longer term revenue play, those are 3 to 5 years offerings. But I would say to you those have been extremely positive.","Unidentified Analyst","Understood and just a broader question on content going into cars. Obviously a lot of fuel efficiency content with ICE and electrification and there is also a lot of active safety content expected to get into cars, both clearly very important. And even with some content coming out, you would expect to see big net increases in cost that's in the median term, any thoughts how the consumer prioritizes different content and is actually able to afford all this increase in cost?","James Verrier","I can comment on that for sure. I think I mentioned earlier that we're not seeing any slowdown in the dialogue and the discussion around the need for technology to drive better fuel economy emission and vehicle performance. I know there is a little bit of perception out there that that's going to slow down and so dollars can be shifted over to these other technologies. We have not seen that. Our activity is as good as it's ever been in terms of working with our OEMs and the business equation has not changed, it's purely a value equation of how can the OEM meet their feel economy and emissions standards at the minimal cost frankly. So that minimizes any impacts on the end consumers.","So when I look across the suite of BorgWarner product to do that, we're in a very-very good position that's why we're delivering the strong mid-single digit growth we're. The adoption rates for our products remain very strong and they will do because there are very good cost effective solutions that get the automakers where they need to in a way that they can support their end consumer.","Operator","Your next question comes from Richard Hilgert with Morningstar. Your line is open.","Richard Hilgert","Couple of questions please. In your comments James, you talked a little bit about the commercial truck outlook and how that's impacting BorgWarner. Is commercial truck still going to be viewed by BorgWarner as being you know a core market or is commercial truck something that BorgWarner might start to move away from?","James Verrier","Now in commercial truck, Richard, is a key part of our business and clearly it's challenged right now in terms of the market conditions, you know we'd seen you know globally you know no real growth in that sector if you wish for a while, but we're in there. You know BorgWarner has continued to grow in that sector, obviously we grow at a much faster pace on the light vehicles side of the business.","So now the commercial vehicle businesses still remain very core to us. We have a number of our products across the portfolio that play in commercial vehicle, clearly the Remy transaction we did has a strong presence in commercial vehicle and that was attractive to us. So we remain committed to commercial vehicle, I think what we'll always see is with 80 plus percent of our business pass car related and a lot of growth in pass car as an end market, you're going to see that that growth generally outweighs in light vehicles over commercial vehicle, but that doesn\u2019t step us away from focusing commitment around commercial vehicle.","Richard Hilgert","With the emissions legislation the Clean Air legislation around the world getting more stringent not only on passenger cars but also on commercial as well as stationary applications or marine applications whatever the case might be, are there any types of fuel efficiency or things that are attractive to BorgWarner on the commercial side that can be adapted from passenger or some new technologies that might fit in with BorgWarner's strategy on commercial?","James Verrier","Yes, absolutely Richard, that's what we do today actually. You know if you think about you know the lot about what you could say commercial vehicle oriented turbo charger technology, we can and we do apply to the light vehicle side of the business and vice versa by the way. We run our turbo businesses as an example as a very integrated business that's very -- creates a lot of synergies from a technology perspective between the commercial vehicle and the light vehicle.","Another great example is you know we apply that dual clutch transmission technology that emanated from light vehicle if you know with Volkswagen and you know we're applying that to the Eaton trucks, so that's another very good example. Our cooling thermal, cooling technology you know fans, fan drive, pump technology, cooling pumps, you know we apply those across both light and commercial vehicles. So it's definitely and if you think of the global situation Richard, where you know a lot of trucks commercial trucks that is, are getting smaller, think of life's little delivery van type technologies and you thinking some markets, you know light, so called light vehicles are getting bigger. You know large pickup truck type vehicles and SUVs, there is a blend of technologies that comes together that can offer competitive position, I think we do that actually very well.","Richard Hilgert","Okay very good, turbo and diesel were kind of like hand-in-hand you don\u2019t usually handle one without the other.","James Verrier","That's right Richard.","Richard Hilgert","That makes sense.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","John Murphy","Just one question here I mean in the press release you guys were talking about the Gilly or Jilly EV7 initiative and you kind of allude to that it's designed for emerging high volume electric vehicle market. It sounds like a little bit of a change intrayear perception of the EU market, is that really focused on growth and the push for NEVs in China or is that sort of a broader statement about the global industry.","James Verrier","John I'll take that. I'll say a couple of things, obviously we do see the EV market evolving. Our macro perspective is you know we generally pointed to you know a \u201920-\u201925 timeline of about a couple of percent of the fleet the world fleet would be EVs. We've always said that could be a percent too high or a little low, but in that range 2% or 3%. We're not moving at this point away from that view John.","I would say incrementally we see more energy enthusiasm intensity in China around electric vehicles. I would say the bigger message we\u2019re trying to get across, John, is you know this overhang with EVs BorgWarner doesn\u2019t have anything, is simply not true. And that's kind of what we're trying to articulate that we will serve that market. And this is a great example of hard parts and assets that are going into electric vehicles leveraging BorgWarner's technology and it\u2019s in China and it's a reasonable volume, whether it\u2019s 15,000 this year.","So macro not really changed on EV John, 2%-3% likely in the future, China probably getting incremental a little more aggressive that way, but the key message is BorgWarner is going to be in that space and play.","John Murphy","That is very helpful and then just a follow-up question, I know you guys commented that shift from cars to crossovers might not have to big an impact on content directly in the short run. But I was just wondering if can comment if we see shift towards more body on frame trucks, specifically the F150, if that could be a real positive mix shift for you and also there maybe longer term as these crossovers are pushed towards all-wheel drive systems for active safety and just for the content could there be a step in content from that vantage point as well?","James Verrier","I think as I mentioned earlier that we've done anything with our guidance to move away from any meaningful truck mix, truck-car mix in North America. And I said if we see a stronger second half where trucks a little better than what's expected today, I mean in general that helps us a little bit, we've been quite open that F150 is a very strongly contended vehicle for BorgWarner so that clearly helps and you have driven for us and I think you know this John, as that truck mix goes and they stop putting meaningful four-wheel drive or all-wheel drive transport capability and turbocharged engines. That starts to step up the content pretty meaningfully for BorgWarner. We have to watch and we do the GM truck share ratio because well our content is very strong on the Ford side, it\u2019s much less so on the GM side, to be transplant with you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joseph Spak","First question is with respect to Wahler and the commentary there, can you provide is there any updated timing and can you still get to the ultimate goals you originally see or this can take longer or are we now to assume that this is going to be structurally lower than initially thought?","James Verrier","If you recall and I am sure you do, when we did the acquisition we've talked about 2 to 3 year transition period to get double-digit margins and then as we went through last year and forward a little bit of change on the restructure. We kind of pushed that, and so it\u2019s certainly going to be closer to three. I think two things, one I think will be challenges to get it done in three, but we will get there, now is that 3.5 is it 4, it 4.5. I would ask you give a little bit more time until we can through some of this heavy lifting on the restructuring that we\u2019re right in the middle of, but structurally we'll get there, we'll get to the double digit margins. We don't do it in the 3 year period, but we're going to get there. And give us a little more time as to whether that\u2019s a 6 months push out or 1 year push out, just because we\u2019re going to get through some of the challenges that we're in right now. But we will get there, I am not worried about that.","Joseph Spak","Okay and then on the guidance, so I understand that the change in revenue from Remy, the EPS is there and I know you've sort of baked in a lot of additional risk for the year. So should we read in that holding EPS guidance, you're eating into that a little bit or was there something else that I missed, maybe that\u2019s a little bit better that allows you offset some of that softness?","James Verrier","What I would say Joe, is it's within the range and we're talking about 2-3 cents here, I don't think it's worth going through a lot of hoops basically for kind of immaterial at this point. You're right. The sales guidance was all driven by Remy, commercial vehicle. Now you get some moving parts on the EPS and I won't go in detail, but for example tax rate went up that was negative, right. Now we had some offset in the core business which was more positive, but then it was offset by some negatives in Wahler. So there is a little bit of walk, but at the end of the day we're in the same range.","Joseph Spak","And then last one, there has been lot more talk on 48-volt, I know that's something you guys have been incremental more excited about, are you seeing any uptick in quoting activity related to that?","Ron Hundzinski","I would say Joe from our viewpoint, I would say the quoting activity in general across all electrification architectures is very strong and probably getting even stronger. A lot of the dialogue we will be in because this is where BorgWarner operate is, many time with the dialogues with the customer will be, they're not sure whether they want a 12-volt or a 48 or 12-and 48-volt. People like BorgWarner can help them find that conclusion.","So I am not necessarily in the view that there has been a massive uptick in pure 48-volt architecture. I think it's definitely going to move up in electrification architecture which we talked about for a while and I think this imply sort of a win, which is James\u2019 view, the ones that conserve it\u2019s flexibility between 12-and 48-volt and not rely on either one. And we have a bunch of products to do that. So whether that\u2019s electric turbocharger, whether that's former Remy motor technology, just a name couple. So it's stronger and we\u2019re right in the midst of it.","Operator","We have time for one final question and that question comes from David Leiker with Baird. Your line is open.","Adam Schmitz","Hi, guys. This is Adam Schmitz on the line for David. On the two additional two additional logic vehicle programs that you won, are there any additional details you can give maybe in terms of products their content where you've won those programs?","James Verrier","Adam I would to but I would get in trouble. With my -- the customers and give us a little bit of time and we'll get out for you. I just really wanted to convey that we continue to get momentum on these electric vehicle programs. I know understandably you want to data, if you can just give a little bit of time we'll get the clarity once we get our customer aligned with us and get that out for you okay.","Adam Schmitz","That's fair worth a shot, and then I guess you've mentioned the higher level OME activity over the past several months, I mean just kind of seeing across the entire business are there maybe any products or geographies where you're seeing a strength?","James Verrier","I think it's pretty linear actually pretty consistent Adam we're seeing that and quoting activity is strong across pretty much all of the business and our win rates are good and booking rates are good. I think incrementally the one I talked to a couple of time today is the electrified or electrification efforts, are incrementally a little higher and continued to go higher which is good news for us. But general it's strong, what I didn't want to convey, Adam was that all the causing activities higher strong on with electrified products and the core business is strong too.","Ken Lamb","I would like to thank you all again for joining us. We expect to file our 10-Q before the end of the year which will provide detail to results. Any follow-up questions about our earnings release, the matters discussed during this call or our 10-Q, please direct them to me.","Melissa please close out the call.","Operator","That does conclude the BorgWarner 2016 first quarter results conference call.

Then, Fr\u00e9d Lissalde, our COO, will outline our second half priorities as well as review some of our recent announcements.

You'll find a link in the Events & Presentations section beneath the notice for this call. We encourage you to follow along during our discussion.","With that, I'll turn it over to James.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you, Pat, and good morning everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning. Fr\u00e9d, Ron and I are very pleased to share our results from Q2 of 2018 and we're also going to update you a little bit on our progress towards delivering our 2018 targets. I thought a good place to start is for me to share a few thoughts on the macro environment and the industry in general. And for those of you that are following along on the webcast, we're on slide number 6. The way I would characterize the headline summary to start off with is, for us our growth over market was in line with our expectations and that was in an environment with global light vehicle production a little bit weaker than we'd expected going into the quarter.","So, let me just give a little bit of color around Q2 industry results. From a global light vehicle production perspective, it came in up slightly less than 4% year-over-year. Now, when you adjust that for a weighted geographic exposure, the market was up a little under 2% year-over-year. And if you think about that from our perspective that was about 150 basis points weaker than our expectation when we provided our Q2 guide.","If I break down that a little bit regionally for a moment. First of all, European light vehicle production was up 4% year-over-year. The highlight on diesel gas mix in Europe continues to shift. We saw diesel share declining by approximately 870 basis points year-over-year in Q2.","Moving to China. China light vehicle production was up close to 9% year-over-year and that was pretty much in line with our expectations as we went into the quarter. From a North American perspective, light vehicle industry production declined about 2.5% year-over-year which is a little bit weaker than expected driven in part by some lost production at one of our key customers due to the supplier fire incident.","From a commercial vehicle perspective, growth there was modestly ahead of our expectations. Now, Fr\u00e9d will go through the details in a short while, but the full year industry volume outlook remains roughly unchanged for us. And as we look at the business going forward, the fundamental upsides and downsides to our industry assumptions appear to be pretty well balanced. So, with that, our expectations for the full year global light vehicle industry is consistent with our prior forecast. What that means is it implies global production growth of less than 1% adjusted for our geographic exposure.","The final point I'll make on this slide though and I think this is the best part of all, the key for us is we expect to continue to outgrow the market in 2018 based on the strong demand for our products.","Now, let me talk a little bit about Q2 results and 2018 outlook and I'm on slide number 7. So, first of all is just a brief summary of the Q2 results and again, Ron will cover this in more detail later. Overall, I was very pleased \u2013 I'm really pleased actually \u2013 our organic growth was in line with our expectations and this was despite slightly weaker industry volume and customer downtime for one of our key platforms which I had mentioned earlier. Operating performance is also up very strong and managed to offset some of these revenue headwinds.","So, putting that into numbers for a moment, recorded $2.7 billion of sales. So, that's up 7.3% organically when we exclude currencies and Sevcon, and this compares to our end market exposure of less than 2%. So, very, very strong outperformance again. Regionally, as was pretty much as we had expected, we did see strong growth in China; our European revenue growth exceeded industry volume growth; our North American revenue was flattish due to the lost volume of one of our key customers, and that was somewhat offset by positive revenue trends in commercial vehicle off-road.","EPS came in at $1.18 excluding non-comparables, and one of my favorite metrics is that's a 23% year-over-year improvement which is pretty fantastic. Operating margins were at 12.7% which is up 20 basis points year-over-year, again very strong performance. Now, for the full year I'm really pleased that we've increased the low end of our organic growth forecast. So, we're expecting organic growth of 6% to 7%, and again this is in a market that is growing less than 1%, so a strong performance. Our consolidated operating income margin is expected to expand to 10 basis points to 20 basis points year-over-year. And we're also increasing our EPS guidance range to $4.45 to $4.50 based on our updated growth outlook and more beneficial tax rate and Ron will walk you through the details that go with that shortly.","So, before I turn it over to Fr\u00e9d, I just wanted to say a few words as this is my \u2013 this will be my last earnings call as I come to the end of a 29-year career with BorgWarner which has been a wonderful journey for me to be in this great company. A few thanks, if I could. I'd first of all, like to thank the board for their continuous support for me but also for the company. As we've repositioned the company in recent years, they played a really strong pivotal role in helping us drive that forward. Obviously, for sure I want to thank the employees, all 32,000 of you that are out there listening, it's your commitment, your dedication to deliver these great results that has made BorgWarner the great company it is. And whether that's financial performance, whether it's quality, whether it's safety, innovative products, BorgWarner knows how to do all of those things and you're the folks that have done it and thank you for your support. It's truly been an honor to lead you.","But as I leave the company, I know a couple of really important things. First of all, I know I'm handing over to the right guy and that makes me feel really, really good. I've known Fr\u00e9d for 19 years. We've worked together in many different capacities and he's always been a superb leader and he will continue to be a superb leader and I know I can make that move in his very, very safe hands.","Fr\u00e9d also has a great team around him. This is a team that's been together pretty closely over the last several years. And as we've built this strategy for the company, the current leadership team is the team that's put that together and I think that great team will stay in place and continue to deliver the type of performance we expect at BorgWarner.","I also leave knowing the company is in a great place. It's strongly positioned. And when I look at what the team has done over the last four or five years, it's pretty remarkable as we transitioned ourself to \u2013 with a new vision for the company of clean, energy-efficient world and we pivoted the company from a powertrain company to a propulsion company, and that wasn't just PowerPoint slides, that was real work. And here we are now with a balanced portfolio for combustion, hybrid and electric products that will serve and deliver growth for the company whatever the end market plays at us and that's something that I feel really, really good about because we're balanced, we have a great strategy and we've got great results ahead. I also leave knowing the company is operating beautifully and you'll see that in the comments from Fr\u00e9d and you'll see in the results from Ron. So, the company is in a really, really terrific spot.","The last thing I'd just like to say with the analyst community and investors that are on the phone, I want to thank you also. You gave us a lot of support, advice, sometimes criticism, often justified, and you challenged us and you made us ask a lot of good questions, and it's a result of that engagement and that discussion with you that has made us a better company and I want to thank you for that.","So, finally I'll turn it over to Fr\u00e9d. Fr\u00e9d, you're the guy. Keep it going for us and best wishes to you. Thank you.","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you, James. On behalf of BorgWarner, I'd like to thank you for your leadership over the past six years as CEO and 29 years at BorgWarner. You are leaving us very strongly positioned for future growth. So, we'd like to wish you and Tracy a great retirement and a great next chapter of your life.","As we look at our priorities for the next six months, there are three that we focused on. One, we are laser-focused on delivering our updated guide, both in terms of organic growth and bottom line earnings. Two, we will secure significant new business awards. I'm very, very happy by the programs we've secured year-to-date, and there are significant second half opportunities across our three segments: combustion, hybrid, and electric. And three, we will monitor and be prepared to manage through the industry risks. These include the potential for additional tariffs. We believe that we're strongly positioned on a relative basis. However, we need to manage any impact on our business going forward.","On slide 10, you see some highlights of a few of our key announcements during the quarter. I think the most significant is the establishment of our Indiana Tech Center. This complements our existing investments that exist around the world related to electric propulsion. It's an impressive facility; very, very high tech with outstanding virtual global collaboration tools. It will be one of the great research development and testing hub for us on the electric propulsion field.","We also wanted to highlight our upcoming Investor Day on September 18. It will take place at our Propulsion Technical Center here in Michigan and will feature presentations by several members of our senior management team. But as importantly, the event will give you the opportunity to touch and experience the products that will drive our future growth. I look forward to seeing many of you there.","With that, let me turn it over to Ron.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you, Fr\u00e9d, and good morning, everyone. Before I review the financial details, I would like to provide you with some of the highlights as I see them for the quarter. First, our organic revenue growth was within our guidance range despite close to 200 basis points headwind from weaker production and a customer plant shutdown. Second, incremental margin performance was stronger than our expectations driven by a strong incremental within our Engine segment and corporate cost savings. And finally, we are increasing the low end of our organic growth guidance and lowering our expected tax rate for the year from 28% to 26%. And as a result, our 2018 EPS guide has once again been increased.","Now, as Pat mentioned, I will be referring to supplemental financial slide deck that is posted on our website and I do encourage you to follow along. Let's turn to slide 13. On a reported basis, sales were up 12.7%. On a comparable basis, our organic growth sales was up 7.3%. It's a solid performance compared to our weighted average light vehicle industry production for the quarter which is up under 2% year-over-year. We saw a 26% growth in China against a production market that was up 9%. Europe revenue was up 7% compared to 4% industry production growth in the quarter. North America revenue was flat versus the 2.5% percent production decline in the quarter. The outgrowth was despite the impact of the F-Series production shutdown that impacted us about 400 basis points. Commercial vehicle was a benefit contributing about 50 basis points of growth in the quarter. And as James mentioned, diesel gas mix in Western Europe was a headwind.","Now, let's look at the year-over-year comparison for operating income which can be found on slide 14. Q2 adjusted operating profit was $341 million compared to $298 million in Q2 of 2017. Our operating margin of 12.7% was a 20-basis-point improvement year-over-year. On a comparable basis, operating income was up $33 million on $167 million of higher sales. That gives us an incremental margin of 19% in the quarter which was a bit better than we expected due to better cost performance and lower headwind from our non-core emissions business. Our adjusted provision for income taxes was $82 million for an effective tax rate of 24% for the quarter, but again 26% year-to-date. Earnings per share on a reported basis was $1.30 per basic share. On an adjusted basis, net earnings were $1.18 per diluted share.","Now, let's take a closer look at our operating segments in the quarter beginning on slide 15 of the deck. Reported Engine segment net sales were $1.674 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the Engine segment on a comparable basis was 7.2% as demand for our light vehicle OEM products was supplemented by growth in our commercial vehicle business. Adjusted EBIT was $279 million for the Engine segment or 16.7% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Engine segment adjusted EBIT was up $24 million on $107 million of our sales for an incremental margin of 23%. This incremental margin is the result of two factors. First, the segment had very strong overall cost performance in the quarter. And second, the headwinds in our non-core emissions business were less than our expectations going into the quarter.","Now, turning to slide 16. Drivetrain segment net sales were up for $1.034 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the Drivetrain segment on a comparable basis was up 7.4% as well. This is primarily due to strong DCT growth in China, transmission components and all-wheel drive. Growth was partially mitigated by the F-Series shutdown in North America. Adjusted EBIT was $116 million for the Drivetrain segment or 11.2% of sales. I like to note that the 70 basis points reduction in margin is all related to Sevcon acquisition.","On a comparable basis, the Drivetrain segment's adjusted EBIT was up $8 million on $68 million of our sales for an incremental margin of 12%. The F-Series shutdown was a drag on incremental margins for us in the quarter.","Now I like to discuss our 2018 full year guidance, which we have increased due to higher foreign currency headwinds. Turning to sales growth guidance for the full year that's on page 18. We continue to expect organic growth of 6% to 7%. The Sevcon acquisition is expected to add approximately $50 million of revenue in 2018. Currency is expected to be $220 million tailwind. This is down from $405 million in our previous guidance and total revenue is now expected to be in a range of $10.64 billion to $10.75 billion.","Next, I'll walk through our operating income on slide 19. From a performance perspective, we expect mid- to high-teens incremental margins on our sales growth. Our consolidated operating income margin is expected to expand to 12.5% to 12.6%.","To finish up our full year guidance, please turn to slide 20. EPS guidance range is now $4.45 to $4.50 per diluted share versus the $4.30 to $4.40 previously. The higher guide is driven by increasing the low-end of our organic growth guidance and lowering our expected tax rate for the year.","We continue to expect free cash flow to be in the $525 million to $575 million range. The tax rate is expected to be in the low-26% range. Our assumption for the dollar to euro exchange rate for the second half has been adjusted down to $1.15.","Now, our third quarter guidance can be found on slide 22. First, sales. We expect organic growth of 4.5% to 6.5%. This is slightly below our full year guidance due to some new business being pulled in the first half and a customer mix in China and Europe. EPS is expected to be in a range of $1.03 to $1.06 per share. This guidance is based on a low-26% tax rate and incorporates $1.15 euro assumption for a $53 million revenue headwind year-over-year.","So, let me summarize quarter two. Overall, execution was very strong. Organic sales growth of 7.3% was good despite that weaker than expected industry volume and impact of customer shutdown. The Q2 incremental margin of 90% was much better than we expected going in. And as we look at the remainder of 2018, we are focused on delivering our financial targets and continue to secure significant new business.","I'd like to take a moment and thank James for his outstanding leadership at BorgWarner. Our partnership was strong and very solid as we went along. There is no doubt that this company is the number one positioned to provide solutions to electrification of the propulsion system. Also I am confident and very excited that Fr\u00e9d and I will continue to grow the company and generate the financial returns that investors are accustomed to. So again, James, thank you for your leadership.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat.","Patrick Nolan - BorgWarner, Inc.","Tasha, we're ready to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Joe Spak of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks for taking the question. And James, congratulations on your retirement. And Fr\u00e9d, likewise, congratulations. I guess, Fr\u00e9d, I wanted to start with you. You focus on \u2013 you mentioned some of the priorities for the second half which sound reasonable. I guess, bigger picture, also I wanted to understand your view just broadly of the powertrain industry, how you view it. There's a lot of assets out there, how you think about consolidation, whether that's needed and what BorgWarner's role in all that could be?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yes. Thanks, Joe. In the propulsion area, our strategy to be balanced across combustion, hybrid and electric is the right thing, and this strategy will be executed \u2013 is executed and will carry on to be executed. We have no missing pieces in our product portfolio to be able to execute this strategy and be growing at mid- to high-single digits year-over-year. So, we are very happy with where we are from a portfolio perspective, from a product perspective. And as I have mentioned before, if we could \u2013 we're already very actively growing the organic portion of our power electronics business. And if we come across with some potential acquisition on power electronic, we would certainly look at that, but absolutely no need for us to look at filling and missing product gap that does not exist.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then just maybe on some of the puts and takes and sort of cadence for the rest of the year. I thought I heard you say a 400 basis point impact from the F-Series in the second quarter, and I assume a good portion of that comes back in the third quarter. But then is the offset maybe some WLTP issues in Europe. And then it also sounded like you said maybe some third quarter business was pulled forward in the second quarter. So, I was just wondering if you could dimensionalize some of those puts and takes, Ron?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yes. Just to clarify something, Joe. When I said 400 basis point, that was a regional impact in North America. Just want to make sure that's clear, okay?","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Overall, it's 50 basis points. Yes, I just want to make sure it's clear.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Perfect. Okay.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","All right.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So, that makes a little bit more sense. But then just in terms of some of the other puts and takes.","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","So, your question is more around Q3 or...","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes, the Q3. Because it would seem like some of that F-Series business would sort of come back helping it but then you talked about some of the offsets from the pull forward, and I was wondering your thoughts on WLTP issues in the back half.","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yes. So, let me give you some clarity on this. So, our organic growth for Q3 is 4.5% to 6.5%. We've seen a lot of pull forward into the first half where we've had a very, very strong backlog. What we see, Joe, is really two market things that are touching us in Q3. One is from a customer mix perspective in China, we see slightly slower growth in the second half. And also from a European customer mix including WLTP certification, we see a little slower numbers too from a market standpoint. On the full year basis, we've upped our guide from 5% to 7% to 6.7% (sic) [6% to 7%] (00:27:10). So, the full year growth is still very, very solid on a [ph] global \u2013 on (00:27:16) a weighted market growth of less than 1%.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","Good morning, Rich.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","James, congratulations on retirement. Best wishes. It's been a pleasure.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thanks, Rich.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And Fr\u00e9d, I look forward to working with you in the future and best wishes as well.","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","Great (00:27:49)","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So, on diesel, so down significantly more than everybody kind of thought here, at least going back to the beginning of the year. So, how is it playing out in terms of the balance of the year on Europe. It seems like you're making up a little bit with the switch to gas maybe new backlog, et cetera. But in terms of positioning here as you exit 2018, how do you feel about getting to a neutral standpoint? I know \u2013 I think, officially, you've talked about 2019, but just how should we think about the cadence in particular larger displacement engines which didn't suffer as much last year that seems to be worsening this year, payback. But just broader comments there in terms of risks here as we think about the back half and into 2019?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","One way to look at it, Rich, is on the year-over-year basis, we drop \u2013 the market drops 600 basis points to 700 basis points. And you remember 1% of shift in diesel gas mix is for us, $20 million to $25 million. What we see, and you are right, we see that the headwind declines in 2019 due to our growth in gasoline turbo, EGR, and VCT. What we also see is that overall, as you mentioned, the decline is faster on small diesel than on big diesel and we also see that the pace of the decline is moderating on a month-over-month basis. We've always managed through those diesel headwinds, and we will manage those headwinds going forward.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. So, it sounds like you feel pretty comfortable about it easing and being able to offset that so \u2013 as you've been doing, so...","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yes.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then just two for Ron. So, the non-core emissions business, where are you in terms of settling all that? And then second, I know we seem to have a little bit of a respite with regards to tariffs here in the last 24 hours. But just any thoughts around whether how much Section 301 is in the back half from China? And then just any initial thoughts on a Section 232 impact? I realize you may be still going through the numbers, but any color there would be helpful? Thanks.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Sure, Rich. So, let me talk about emissions first. I would say that the headline is basically we're on track. And what I mean by that is we are doing management presentations with some potential buyers, that should finish up here shortly with final bids coming in. We are moving products out of one of the facilities in Europe. And if all goes well, we're looking at probably a end of Q3 or early Q4 close at this point. So, I would say that in general everything's on track. I'm pretty close to the transaction and things are going well there.","On the tariffs side, Rich, so I'm going to go through a little more detail here on that. So, the first thing I'd like to talk about the commodity inflation of the Section 232 around steel and aluminum, we have been experiencing already year-to-date. So, this is something that's just not new. When this was put in place we were seeing some headwinds but we were finding ways to mitigate that and that really dragged those issues into our results. So, that's the first thing I want to note and that'll continue through the year. And I think that the operating folks have done a fantastic job mitigating through the Section 232 steels and aluminum.","Now, when you get into the Section 301, we have incorporated, and it's already reflected in our guide, but we are seeing some cost inflation of about a $10 million to $20 million headwind in the back half. But again, like I said, we're working through that and we're finding very \u2013 we'll find a lot of alternative ways to get around this but it isn't \u2013 it's baked in there.","Now, you referred to the Section 232 automotive, I would just say that's a big issue. The numbers are easy to apply because if you look at our total purchases coming into the U.S. that we're still sorting through, it's significant. So, those will have significant impacts on us but we're not really finalized with all those calculations but that's a big impact and that's more speculative in going into next year as you know. But it's a big number for everybody, not just for BorgWarner.","And then I just want to comment on NAFTA, that's still kind of hanging out there. And then, there's this extra, the $200 billion that's across the board as well that's a little bit speculative because they haven't really identified all the components that would come under the tariff. The Section 301 was \u2013 we can identify components that's why we came up \u2013 we can identify the $10 million to $20 million. And in fact, in those numbers we know by component pretty much what the headwinds are. So, hopefully, that's a little bit more clarity around that for you.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And then real quick...","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","And if there's anything that \u2013 but maybe I would have Fr\u00e9d to add anything about that as well.","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yes, Rich, what I just want to add is that we think that on a relative basis, we're pretty well positioned since we produce our final product in the same region as our customers production facilities are. So, for sure the commodities and tariffs certainly impact the business through our supply base. And as you mentioned, it's I would say fairly fluid, changes every hour. So, our goal is to be agile and monitor those changes and react appropriately going forward.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","For your product portfolio you wouldn't be at a disadvantage versus your key competition with regards to the Section 232 automotive.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","We don't think so.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Not a disadvantage, no.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. All right. Thanks. I'll pass it on.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Chris McNally from Evercore. Your line is open.","Chris McNally - Evercore ISI","Hi, gentlemen. James, Fr\u00e9d, I know it's been echoed a bunch, but congratulations to you, to you both again.","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you.","Chris McNally - Evercore ISI","Two questions. So, one on Drivetrain and the second on just the environment as a whole in Europe. So, when I look at the incremental margin on Drivetrain despite the total incremental margin for the company continuing to be in a pretty attractive mid-teens level, we're seeing Engine move into the 20% range in the first half despite lower growth and Drivetrain with a lower base still in the lower teens. Can you just maybe give some color where we could sort of see that inflection in Drivetrain as clearly there's a longer-term opportunity to drive margins there higher? And then the second can you maybe quantify, you mentioned Europe in Q3 for WLTP as a headwind, would you be able to maybe just put some numbers around that?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","So, Chris, this is Ron, and good morning. Let me address the margin question you had on the Drivetrain. If you go back and look at the last six quarters and I could be off a quarter here, Drivetrain margins have actually been outstanding, very high, 15-plus. It was really only Q2 of 2018 that we've seen this 12% in quite a long time. So, this is primarily driven like we were talking the F-Series is having a drag on the incremental margins. So, I would say that the Drivetrain incremental margins have been outstanding in the prior quarters and we fully expect once we get to the transition to F-150, that we'll be back to the mid-high-teens incremental margins again in Drivetrain. So, if we go back and look at a few things, you'll see this was just one of those quarters. But the exciting part for us was actually was the Engine group being up that high 19 (00:36:07) because that was the segment that was lower historically.","But again with emissions business improving for us year-over-year and some good cost controls, the segment, the Engine segment did well. And then when you add in the corporate costs, actually we're down, that just leverage us a little bit more for a total company accrual margin. So, the Drivetrain was just a quarter or two (00:36:28) at this point and I don't think it's going to stay in that range. And then WLTP. Fr\u00e9d?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yes. So, Chris, on the WLTP certification, I would say that the impact that we may see is already baked in our market assumption and we don't see any company specific major impact.","Chris McNally - Evercore ISI","Okay. That's great. And just a quick follow-up on the WLTP, if we saw some recovery in Europe in Q4, would you have enough exposure where that could be upside or sort of conservatively baked into your guide.","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","It's in the band. It's in the range. It's a bit too early to know exactly what upside we could see in Q4.","Chris McNally - Evercore ISI","Okay. Perfect. Thank you so much, guys.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you.","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you, Chris.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks very much. Hey, Ron, with the tax rate moving lower towards 26%, is that the right baseline we should think about for future years? How do you see the potential for that, potentially it can go lower through tax planning as we look at 2019 and 2020?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","First, Noah, thank you for asking a question because I'm actually very excited about the tax rate but that hasn't come up yet. Good question. We came into the year, we held our guide at 29%, we did bring it down to 28%. And we knew we can lower the tax rate but we thought it was going be a 2019 event. I'm extremely excited and actually very happy that the tax department was able to move that up a couple of quarters to 26%.","They do have a lot of planning ideas to lower that rate. The question is how low and when. And I think you're going to have to wait some more clarity going forward unfortunately, Noah. But I will say this, the rate will come down and I unfortunately cannot give you a number right now because there's a lot of planning activities that we're doing but we're very comfortable it's going to come down. And again, like I said, unfortunately, I can't give you the timing. But for modeling purposes, you're going to have to wait, Noah, all right?","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Sure. Sure. I think that's helpful directionally. And then a couple of references now to F-Series, margin drag on Drivetrain, would you mind was just telling us what that was so we can actually call it out here?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","As far as the amount of sales that we've lost in the quarter or...","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","What the headwind was to margins from that, yes, in Drivetrain?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","You can basically take $25 million of sales headwind and we didn't take out the cost. So, I'd have to do some calculations and get back with you as far as what the headwinds were, Noah. But it was about $25 million in the region, in North America region for us which \u2013 and if you just tie the standard margin to us, you can get some decent numbers there.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. And then if I could ask one more and, James, I'll echo what others have said, pleasure in getting to know you and work with you and the very best wishes on your retirement. And Fr\u00e9d, much success to you in this new role as well.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you, Noah.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","I think you talked a bit about power electronic portfolio and it looks like you may be ever so modestly raise the expected 2018 revenue contribution from Sevcon. I guess as we look at the pipeline for power electronics sales, what are you seeing now as more of a driver? Is it 48-volt mild hybrid? Is it growth in plugins? Can talk a little bit about how you see the future growth opportunities there?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yes. Noah, we see the use of the power electronic portfolio in all of the above. We see an extended product portfolio, for example, on P2 48 volts, on P2 high voltage, iDM for electric vehicles. So, this power electronic product portfolio is going to be instrumental for our ROE. And not only on Drivetrain, it's also the case for eBooster. So, this is this is part of what we've done already for quite some years and Sevcon only added horsepower behind it. The power electronics is pretty much in everything we do and will be part of our products as you will see in the Investor Day going forward.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Perfect. Thanks so much.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you, Noah.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you, Noah.","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you, Noah.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Your line is open.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Good morning, Brian.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","James, been a pleasure working with you. And I guess bienvenue to Fr\u00e9d. Just a couple questions, first, short term and then more of a longer term one. The shorter term one is what are you seeing in the European marketplace on diesel? The German OEMs are supposedly saying it's reached a floor for maybe perhaps the longer range Autobahn applications and commercial where it makes sense. But what are you seeing and then how's it kind of affecting your thinking this year and next?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yes. Brian, I wouldn't say that it reached a floor. But as I mentioned before, the pace of decline is moderating. We still see some decline in the small displacement. So, what I would characterize as below 1.8 or 2 liter. And as far as we're concerned, we're managing the diesel mix fairly well, we have and we will in the future. And by 2019, we'll be totally agnostic in Europe on that mix due to our really good growth on efficient small gasoline engines.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Second question, as you kind of think about the role you play with the new product lines around motor, electric motors, electric drivetrains and just think about kind the kind of electric content of those as opposed on hybrids and the gas, some of the enhancements in the internal combustion engine part of those, how do you think mid-term and longer term about OEMs potentially insourcing that especially, Fr\u00e9d, in Europe where \u2013 since James' country is no longer part of Europe or the OEMs have substantial engine and transmission employment base in high-cost, unionized plants that they may want to convert into electric motors and electric drivetrains.","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","I would say that the \u2013 we see many different insourcing, outsourcing strategies and those strategies are fluid. What it will \u2013 I think one color I would like to give you is I think the insourcing, outsourcing strategy is going to be volume related. And when we will make and we make motors and depending on the volumes that we produce, when it's made by a supplier the volume is going to be much, much bigger than if an OE does it for his own consumption. We have a lot of different factors that are impacting this make or buy decisions from a motor perspective.","What I can tell you is that we have in our portfolio one of the best motor in the world with our S-wind forming process that you will see at the Investor Day. The power density of that motor is one of the best that exists around the world. And in our business it's all about having the right product to drive efficiency in propulsion. And I think we're really well-positioned with the products that we have to offer.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And if an OEM does want to insource some portion of assembly for electric motors and drivetrains as they do for example in transmissions, do you still see a component business there and how would that affect your kind of longer-range growth targets?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","We will never say no for any business.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan from UBS. Your line is open.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats, James and Fr\u00e9d.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you, Colin.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Just my first question is very basic, you raised your organic growth range to the high end, but it seems like the quarter was pretty rough from a market perspective, I mean, what were the factors that gave you confidence to raise it?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Well, one thing, Colin, you got to put in (00:46:05) consideration is that Q1 was actually a very good quarter for us and Q2 was \u2013 F-Series is going to kind of get right-sized, going forward. And we're taking a look at a couple other launches that are coming in the back half the year. And year-to-date, we're at 7%, keep in mind, right. So, from what we're seeing in the marketplace, it's shaping up so that we can lower the lower end of the guide and I guess that raises the midpoint is what it does. From what we're seeing, we're pretty confident about it.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Great. And any color on \u2013 you mentioned steel, I mean how much is baked in as a headwind for this year and how much \u2013 is there any recovery help in the second half that's not going to last (00:46:53)?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Well, yes, so when you talk about the Section 232 steel portion, like I was saying earlier, we've already experienced headwinds but we've also mitigated that. We have plans in place as we took \u2013 it came into the quarter for the full year, and we felt that that was not going to significantly impact our operating results on the steel and we looked at alternative ways of mitigating that. So, it's not really a net number at this point. If it is, it's an immaterial portion that's not affecting our operating income.","The other one I was mentioning too, was the Section 301 which is a relatively new tariff that's come in that we're still sorting through. But that one is experiencing $10 million to $20 million, and we've found ways to mitigate that that we're working on. But on the steel side, we've done a good job just mitigating it.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And just lastly, the Sevcon deal gives you sort of the inverter capability and it seems like the trend have taken the (00:47:53) e-motor and merging that. I imagine that might be some of the strategy there. I mean, is that in the product pipeline, a merged e-motor and inverter?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","I don't know exactly what you mean with merge but an inverter is a motor controller. So, having a motor in-house makes the controllability of that motor much easier when you know exactly all attributes of that motor. And our strategy has always been and will always be to position ourselves as being one of the only one in the world from a battery electric vehicle that not only specifies but makes the transmission piece, the motor piece, and the controller, which is the inverter. I hope that answers your question.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","I guess I was talking about, I think in certain vehicles, there are two separate actual physical products and then like on recent ones they're actually one large product. Is that...","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yes, yes, I see what you mean, okay. Again, it's not one size fits all. There is a logic to integrate inverter and motor. I think in a battery electric vehicle what our customers are trying to do is limit the 400 volts or high-voltage cables in the car. And when you combine the motor and the inverter together, that helps you doing that. But we also see other architecture types that would keep those two elements separate. It's not because it's separate that I shouldn't work together like on dual-clutch transmission, the controller and the clutch are separate. Nevertheless, they function jointly. So, whether or not it is one unit or two different units, it has to talk to \u2013 both units have to talk to each other seamlessly.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning guys. And James, congrats on a long very successful career in transitioning the company for the future. And Fr\u00e9d, congrats but you've got a lot \u2013 you've got some big shoes to fill, so we're looking forward to it, literally and figuratively, right.","So, maybe a first question, as you think about all the trade tariffs, everything that's going on right now and the uncertainty, how do you think about capital allocation decisions, right? Ron, you kind of went through the list and it's very helpful and you've obviously thought a lot about this. But I mean if something changes, right, it could change back in two years or six years. So, are you just going to have to follow your customers' lead on this stuff or are there other actions you can take? Because you make long-term capital commitments, not short-term capital commitments.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yes, the first thing, and Fr\u00e9d mentioned this, John, is that we typically produce in the region that our customers are in. We don't have a lot of cross-border products going. We don't serve our North American customers with parts coming out of China for example, right. So, that's a benefit for us for the first thing. But with that said, the Section 232 total automotive parts, obviously if that were to be enacted down the road that would significantly alter our decisions going forward about capital allocation and investments and where we put it.","I would say that I think the lessons that's being learned here is that you have to remain flexible and balanced as you start to put investments throughout the world. And when you have a policy environment that tends to be unstable that just means that you have to build in more flexibility in the manufacturing footprint is what we're starting to learn.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then, maybe a second question as a follow-up to that. I mean, as you look at the rise in the buyback from $100 million to $150 million, does that mean that there are less opportunities sort of internally and as far as acquisitions that you're seeing on the horizon or is this just your prediction looks better \u2013 your financial position looks better and the stock looks cheap to you.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","It's what you just said the latter, financial position is good and the stock is cheap. It has nothing to do with the outlook on the M&A side. It's just the opportunity to buy stock, cheap, you're right.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just lastly, I mean when we look at slide 19, it looks like the op income forecast went down ever so slightly but the actual operations are better. FX is a little bit less of a benefit. So, net-net it's about the same. I mean given all the puts and takes in the second half of the year that you're looking at, Ron, is this a conservative view just based on uncertainty? Because your first half performance has been very strong and in light of sort of the disruption on Ford's trucks, which should catch up in the third and fourth quarter, it seems like that things might be a bit better than you were initially expecting. But is this a conservative guide? Really how should we think about your positioning on this?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","I wouldn't say it's conservative. I would say that there's a lot of risk factors in the back half of the year that we're focused on right now. And because of all those risk factors, things can move around rapidly for us. So, I think we put in all the risk elements that we're aware of and it's a very realistic number that we hope to deliver here. Actually, we will deliver it.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks.","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","As I mentioned, we're focused on delivering this guidance, delivering our commitment.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you very much and congrats, James.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yes. Thank you, John.","Operator","And we have time for one final question and that question comes from Armintas Sinkevicius from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. When I think about the propulsion agnostic portfolio that James has assembled here and Fr\u00e9d will be taking over, one of your peers reports a bookings figure for power electronics and I know you just opened up a technical center. And I'm just trying to think through when should we start to see some of these power electronics products from Remy and Sevcon start to flow through the backlog and really start to impact the numbers here?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","First of all, the power electronics is part of a bigger system, a bigger product that we sell. It's either imbedded into hybrid modules or drive module for electric vehicles. So, I don't think you'll see us breaking down the power electronics portion of what we sell. As you will see in the Investor Day, it is embedded in everything that we sell going forward and you'll be able to witness touching the products. But I don't think going forward we'll break it down like we won't break down friction versus mechanical or any other pieces of the system we sell.","Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Okay. Got it. And then I guess just how should investors be thinking about getting comfortable with the growth in power electronics? Just what should we be watching for as far as announcements or disclosures?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yes. We'd love to announce more but we can't and we are very respectful of the confidentiality that we have with our customers. I think one way to look at it is if you look at our growth on H&E, a certain portion of it will always have power electronics in there. So, that will give you a little bit of light on our growth in this field of product.","Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then one more on the Section 232 automotive tariffs. You said it was a big impact. Is it a big direct impact as far as direct tariff costs? I know you said you produce in country, for country or does it lead to sort of bigger question marks around","the supply chain? Just trying to think through how we should be thinking about the big impact comment.","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yes. As Ron mentioned, we produce where the final product is concerned. So, there will be very, very marginal direct impact, if not any. So, it's going to be \u2013 if it comes, it's going to be all indirect.","Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you so much for taking the questions.","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thanks, Armintas.","James R.

After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.","I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Nolan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Nolan, you may begin your conference.","Patrick Nolan - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. We issued our earnings release at 6:30 AM Eastern Time. It's posted on our website, borgwarner.com, on our homepage, and on our Investor Relations homepage.","Before we begin our call, I need to inform you that, during this call, we may make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today.","During our presentation, we'll highlight certain non-GAAP measures in order to provide a clearer picture of how our core business performed and for comparison purposes with prior periods.

When you hear us say adjusted, excluding non-comparable items, that means on a non-comparable basis. When you hear us say on a reported basis, that means U.S. GAAP.","Now, back to today's call. First, James Verrier, our President and CEO, will comment on the industry followed by high-level overview of our Q1 results and full-year outlook. Then, we will discuss some of our recent product wins.","Then, Ron Hundzinski, our CFO, will discuss the details of our guidance as well as our results.","Please note that we've posted our earnings call presentation. At the IR page of our website, you'll find the link in the Events & Presentations section beneath the notice for the call. We encourage you to follow along with these slides during our discussion.","With that, I'll turn it over to James.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you, Pat, and good morning, everybody. Ron and I are really pleased actually to share our results today from Q1 2018 and also give you an update on our progress as we march towards delivering our 2018 target.","Before I get going, I do realize many of you on the call have been taking a lot of calls this morning, so I'm going to try and keep my prepared remarks a little shorter than usual Albeit, I'll cover all the main points. So, let me kick off by sharing a few thoughts on the macro environment and the industry. And for those of you following along, we're on slide number 6 in the deck. So at a high level, I would start with this.","Our growth over the market was a little stronger than we'd expected in the quarter. And during that same time, global light vehicle production was a little bit weaker than anticipated and, hence, our growth versus the market was a little stronger. If I give you some background on Q1 from an industry perspective, basically, global light vehicle production came in about 2% for the quarter versus our expectation of it being pretty much flat as we went into the quarter. If I break that down a little bit for you regionally, so European light vehicle production was down slightly with some volume pushed into Q2. We saw the continued shift from diesel to gas mix in Europe and I'll share a little bit more commentary on that later. We saw diesel share in the quarter declined by about 760 basis points from a year over comparison to Q1.","Let me switch to China. So, China light vehicle production was down 3% year-over-year and that was pretty much in-line with what our expectations were as we started the quarter. From a North American perspective in light vehicle, industry production declined almost 3%, but we did note that mix was holding up particularly well.","The other thing of note from an industry perspective is growth in our CV business continued and that did somewhat offset some of the like \u2013 the lower light vehicle industry trends. Let me continue on a little bit from an industry perspective and shift more towards a full-year view. So our expectations for the full year, global light vehicle industry is very consistent with our prior forecast.","So, what that means it implies global production growth of approximately 1% when you adjust for our geographical exposure. Again, just quickly walking through the regions for you, we expect China growth of about 1% to 2%, we see Europe up similar level between 1% and 2% and North America flat to up slightly.","From a commercial vehicle perspective, we do expect to see some benefit in the coming quarters, though we are assuming a little bit of a lower benefit than we saw in Q1. So, if you look at that, our industry assumptions appear to be pretty balanced, and I would say consistent with how we started the year, the view that we had coming into the year.","So, some highlights there. With the commercial vehicle, we're going to continue to watch and see if that commercial vehicle volume will continue to be sustained. China, we continue to pay a lot of attention too as we expect modest industry growth in 2018, maybe some potential upside in the back half. And on the downside, we're obviously paying a lot of attention to the diesel gas mix where we're expecting at least a 500-basis point shift from diesel to gas mix in the year of 2018.","And we continue, like, I think, everybody looking to get better feels for diesel inventory in Europe, so we can get a better track on that. But the key for all of that, if I step back for a moment, is that we're going to continue to expect to outgrow the markets in 2018 by the continued strong demand for our products.","Talking about products, let me just add a little bit of commentary what we're seeing in the world relative to hybrid and electric programs and how that's evolving. I would say the key message really is our customers are continuing to march very strongly towards adoption of hybrids and electrics, particularly with some of the regulatory uncertainty out there. All of the automakers are realizing they need that balance mix in their fleet between combustion, hybrid and electric and, naturally, we're working very closely with them.","For us specifically at BorgWarner, I'm very encouraged by the hybrid and electric programs we've secured to-date. You start to see some of that flowing through to our press releases. And what we're going to do is, as we get to our Analyst Day in September, we'll be giving you a thorough and full overview of the progress we've been making around hybrids and electrics.","So, the key and the punch line for us is two things: We're going to continue to expect to book more growth and gain what we need to do from a business booking perspective for hybrid and electric; and we were really confident that our portfolio off products allows us to do that. So, we're very confident and comfortable in our product mix inside the company.","Let me move to slide 7 now and give you a little bit of a view of our Q1 results and our outlook for 2018. So I'll start with Q1 results, and I'd say overall I was very pleased. We came in with our organic growth above our guidance, as I said, in a slightly weaker market and solid incremental margin performance, which Ron will cover in some detail. We recorded $2.8 billion of sales, which is a quarterly record for us and that's up 6.6% organically when you exclude FX and Sevcon. And again, this compares to our end market exposure of down 2%.","Regionally came in pretty much as we'd expected. We saw very strong growth for the company in China. We also saw positive light vehicle revenue trends in Europe and North America despite declines in industry volume. This light vehicle growth was supplemented by positive revenue trends in commercial vehicle off-road.","From an EPS perspective, we delivered $1.10, which expressed non-comparable items. And for comparison purposes versus the quarter last year, that's a 21% year-over-year improvement in our EPS, which is outstanding performance. Operating margin is solid at 12.2%. And again, Ron will provide more color and commentary on that.","Let me switch to give you a little bit of a high level view for the full year. Our organic growth rate is unchanged, but once again we're going to be increasing our EPS forecast, largely driven by FX, which again Ron will cover in his remarks. So, we continue to expect organic growth of 5% to 7% year-over-year in a market that is flat to up 1%. And we still see our consolidated operating income margin expected to expand between 10 basis points and 20 basis points year-over-year.","I'd like to move to slide 8 for those following along and just talk a little bit about some of the highlights of recent announcements. And again, it was another strong quarter for us where we booked a lot of business across the portfolio in combustion, hybrid and electric. I'm just going to highlight three that you see on the slide here that I think were particularly important for us.","First one, you see, we were very pleased to win a 2018 Automotive News PACE Award for our S-wind wire forming process for electric motors and alternators.","And for those of you that have listened to me talk about this for the last couple of years, I've spoken a lot about motors are not just motors. There's a lot of technology in the types of motors that we're using, both from a product and a process design point of view. And for our perspective, this is strong validation of that from an external party. So very pleased with that one.","We also announced that we'll be supplying our eGearDrive transmission for two First Automotive Works Group electric vehicles. And we also have there, we're supplying our Electro-Mechanical On-Demand transfer case for the Ram 1500 4x4 pickup truck, which is a terrifically good program for BorgWarner.","So again, the message is consistent. This balanced approach of winning business and growing across all three propulsion systems for combustion, hybrid and electric remains on track and remains very strong for us.","So let me take a few moments to close before I turn over to Ron. Q1 was a great start to the year for us, very strong performance both top line and bottom line. We're feeling very confident about our full-year outlook, which will be another strong growth year for the company.","And really importantly from where I sit, the year-to-date new business wins that we've achieved across combustion, hybrid and electric continues to give me a lot of confidence in the long-term growth and balance across propulsion for the company. So great start to the year. And with that, let me turn it over to Ron.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Before I review the financial details, I would like to provide you some of the highlights as I see them for the quarter.","First, as James has said, the quarter was strong and a solid start to the year. Second, organic growth was better than our expectations. And I should note it was a record sales quarter despite weaker industry volumes. And finally, we are maintaining the organic growth guidance, but we're increasing our EPS guidance based on FX benefits.","Now, as Pat mentioned, I will be referring to supplemental financial slide deck that is posted on our website, so I encourage you to follow along.","Let's turn to slide 10. On a reported basis, sales were up 15.7%. On a comparable basis, our organic sales was up 6.6%. Very strong performance compared to our weighted average light vehicle industry production for the quarter, which was down 2%. We saw a 29% growth in China against production market that was down 3%. Europe revenue was up 7% compared to the 1% industry production decline in the quarter.","North America revenue was up 3% versus the 3% production decline in the quarter. Commercial vehicle was a benefit, contributing about 100 basis points of growth. And diesel and gas mix in Western Europe was a headwind for us.","Now, let's look at the year-over-year comparison for operating income, which can be found on slide 11. Q1 adjusted operating profit was $339 million \u2013 this, again, was a quarterly record as well \u2013 compared to $292 million in Q1 of 2017. Our operating margin of 12.2% was a 10-basis point improvement year-over-year. However, if you excluded the tailwind from FX and Sevcon, margins would have expanded some 30 basis points to 40 basis points.","On a comparable basis, operating income was up $26 million on $157 million of higher sales. That gives us an incremental margin of 17% in the quarter, which is a bit better than our expectations due to better cost performance and a lower headwind from our non-core emissions business. On adjusted provision for income tax basis was $85 million for an effective tax rate of 28% for the quarter.","I would also point out the year-over-year increase in net earnings attributable to non-controlling interest and the growth in this line item reflects our minority partner share in the earnings performance of our Chinese consolidated joint ventures. We do expect this to increase throughout 2018.","Earnings per share on a reported basis was $1.07 per basic share. On an adjusted basis, net earnings were $1.10 per diluted share. And as James said, that's an increase of 21% year-over-year.","Now, let's take a closer look at our operating segments in the quarter beginning on slide 12. Reported Engine segment sales were $1.716 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the Engine segment on a comparable basis was 4.9% as demand for our light vehicle OEM products was supplemented by growth from our commercial vehicle sales.","I would note that we reclassified Sevcon battery charging business into our Engine segment as we believe this business is better fit with our commercial vehicle and aftermarket business, which primarily resides in this segment.","Adjusted EBIT was $280 million for the Engine segment or 16.3% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Engine segment's adjusted EBIT was up $16 million on $74 million of sales for an incremental margin up 22%. This incremental margin is a result of two factors. First, the segment was very strong in overall cost performance in the quarter. And second, headwinds from our non-core emissions business were less than we expected going into the quarter.","Turning to slide 13, Drivetrain segment net sales were $1.083 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the Drivetrain segment on a comparable basis was 9.2%, primarily due to higher strong DCT growth in China and transmission components in four-wheel drive as well.","Adjusted EBIT was $121 million for the Drivetrain segment or 11.2% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Drivetrain segment adjusted EBIT was up $13 million on $85 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 15%, and this is good performance and reflects the successful ramp of new programs.","Now, I'd like to discuss our 2018 guidance, which we have increased due to higher foreign currency tailwinds.","Turning to sales growth guidance for the full year on slide 15. We continue to expect organic growth of 5% to 7%. The Sevcon acquisition is expected to add $50 million to revenue 2018. Currency is expected to be a $400 million tailwind now, that's up from $170 million, and total revenues now expected to be in the range of $10.77 billion to $10.94 billion.","Next, I'll walk you through our operating income on slide 16. From a performance perspective, we expect mid- to high-teens incremental margins on sales growth. Our consolidated operating income margin is expected to expand to 12.5% to 12.6%. I would point out that this margin guidance is in line with our guidance prior to the reclassification of a pension income adjustment, which is in accordance with the new accounting standard. And for those of you who are interested, it's FASB ASU No. 2017-07. This is a 10 bps impact versus our original guidance, but with no EPS impact.","To finish up the full year guidance, please turn to slide 17. EPS guidance range is now $4.30 per diluted share to $4.40 per diluted share versus $4.25 per diluted share to $4.35 per diluted share previously. Like I said before, the increase is driven by the impact of larger FX benefit. This EPS guidance does include a $0.06 year-over-year EPS headwind related to higher minority interest and lower equity income. We continue to expect free cash flow to be in the $525 million to $575 million range. The tax rate is remaining the same at 28% and our assumption for the dollar to euro exchange rate has been adjusted to approximately $1.22 from $1.18.","Now, our second quarter guidance is on slide 19. For sales, we continue to expect organic growth of 7% to 9%. This is above our full-year guidance, primarily due to stronger year-over-year industry production. EPS is expected to be in a range of $1.09 to $1.11 including a $0.02 year-over-year headwind from higher minority interest and lower equity income. This guidance is based on a 28% tax rate and incorporates $1.23 [to] \u20ac1 assumption or about $125 million revenue benefit year-over-year.","So in conclusion, let me summarize quarter one. It was another strong quarter to start the year, as James and I mentioned earlier. Organic sales growth of 6.6% despite decline in industry volume. The Q1 incremental margin of 17% was slightly better than expectations. And as we look at the remainder of 2018 and beyond, we see substantial opportunities to participate in impending electrification trend while our combustion-related business continues to outpace market growth.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat.","Patrick Nolan - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you, Ron. Dan, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of David Leiker with Baird. Your line is now open.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Good morning, David.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Good morning, David.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Two questions. First, a numbers question. The working capital number I'm guessing is distorted a little bit by currency and FX, but I thought reasonable amount here year-over-year. Any thoughts on that?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","The only thing is this is a general trend in the first quarter. Working capital is needed to get into production after the fourth quarter where volumes ramp down, David. I would say that, year-over-year, we were not alarmed. Our ratios of days on sale for inventory and receivables was pretty much payables, was a little bit of what we probably pay their bills a little bit quicker basically. And then the emissions as well probably had an impact on it. So, nothing alarming. We're still holding our full-year cash forecast.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then, secondly, on the portfolio products that you're billing out for hybrids and EVs. I guess two different parts of this, one from the drive motor, the gearbox. What do you need to do there? Is there anything you need to do there to broaden that product range at all and what the timing is of bringing those types of products to market?","And then, secondly, as you're out there booking a lot of great new business, new contracts there, do you have any sense what your win rate or market share is of those programs that you're going after?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","So, David, this is James. I would say the first thought I would share with you, we're very, very happy with the technology that we got from a drive motor and a gearbox perspective and now obviously with the added power electronics capability we've got from Sevcon, that's just strengthened us. So, we have a lineup of motors and we have a lineup of gearboxes that run the full range needed for hybrid and electrics. And actually that's why you can probably tell in my comments that we're booking really well.","And so we're picking up the business that we need to and you're starting to see that flow through the press releases. I can have Pat, actually, David, give you the amount we've actually secured this year on eGearDrives and motors because of some specific data. But I would say in general, if I look back six months ago to the Investor Day, David, on what we'd hoped to book around hybrid applications and electric, I would say we're ahead. I don't have a number to give you in terms of revenue or percentage. We can work on that with you, but I would say directionally we're absolutely running ahead of where I thought we would be both in terms of win rates, absolute bookings, and dollars. I just don't have that specific info with me, but we're definitely doing well, and we have the portfolio needed. I don't need to go and add anything beyond what we've got to keep \u2013 to deliver on the growth that we've got out there.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, congratulations. Congratulations on the (00:23:44) contract.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah, thanks.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Or award, yeah.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Your line is now open.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Hey, Colin.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Any color on how much diesel mix as a headwind within the quarter? I know it looked pretty bad, so I was \u2013 want an update there and if you could also maybe update the dollar exposure, I think you've said in the past like 80 cents on the dollar gas-diesel ratio?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah, Colin. So for the quarter, it was 760 bps year-over-year shift from diesel to gas for the quarter. And for the full year, we're estimating about 500 bps full year, year-over-year 2017 to 2018 diesel to gas mix. And for every 100 bps it moves, it's a net revenue impact for BorgWarner of about $20 million to $25 million. Did that help you?","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","No, it's very helpful. And that \u2013 when your initial guidance was a 200 basis points to 300 basis points decline, so is it a bit worse?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah, 300 basis points to 400 basis points is how we started the year, Colin. So, we're trending a little worse than what we'd expected because we've now shifted to about 500 basis points to 600 basis points. And like I said, the first quarter was 760 basis points down. So, that's kind of where we're at right now.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Okay, I just like to add some (00:25:13). That's what the market is doing. We're not seeing, again, in 2018 the full impact that we did, the same thing happened to us in 2017. The market's moving faster than what we're actually experiencing in our business.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Got it.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Colin, one of the thing not to overdo \u2013 these things drive you crazy, but obviously we're talking light vehicle here, just to separate the commercial vehicle aspect.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","And actually, the irony of this which is kind of cool for us is that strength in commercial vehicle is pretty much offsetting that light vehicle diesel shift. So, that's why we're delivering the outcomes we're doing.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And any thoughts on the potential for the U.S. fuel economy fares to get pushed out? Do you think that helps your Engine product and then maybe they have a longer life? Does this really make a difference to your business? Any color there?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. So, that's a fair question and we \u2013 like everybody else, we don't really know. We know obviously there's a lot of discussions going on. There's a lot of review going on. I think the sentiment is one of, if anything, it's kind of relaxing \"the standard\" a little bit. But here's what we do now, Colin. The rate of improvement and efficiency required across all three architectures: combustion, hybrid, electric. Has to continue to climb from where we are today. So on combustion, what that's going to mean is more advanced turbos, more advanced variable cam timing, et cetera. That's what's driving our growth. As we're optimizing, get more efficient on the combustion products.","And hybrids and electrics obviously, we've got a strong portfolio. So the net for us as a company, Colin, we have growth in all three vehicle types: combustion, hybrid and electric. What happens for us is with the different OEMs, the mix of hybrid, electric and combustion will vary a little bit depending on the adoption rate and the climb with the standards. But for us, net-net, we're growing independent of that shift or slowdown or acceleration of standards.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. All right. Thank you very much for taking my question.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you, Colin.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you, Colin.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everybody.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Hey, Rod.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Good morning, Rod.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I had a couple questions. First one, I just want to apologize just given the number of companies that have reported today, I should have dissected this already, but your full-year guidance change basically appears to reflect the upside from Q1 when I look at the earnings per share. Can you just clarify, for the rest of the year, it sounds like you raised your FX assumption, but did you offset that with downward revisions to diesel mix or something else?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","No. We're still concerned about our emissions business going forward. They had one great quarter and they gave us good tailwind. I'm not in a position. I don't think we are as a management team to say it's going to continue the headwinds going forward, Rod. So, we're just going to watch that business quarter-by-quarter until we sell it.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And that was actually my second question, just on that emissions business. How much of a drag was that at this point and what's your timing on resolving this?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","So going into the quarter, we anticipate it would be about a $5 million per quarter headwind for the first two quarters and then it would kind of even us up out in the back half of the year. We didn't see all the $5 million headwind in the first quarter, Rod.","Now, that's not to say \u2013 we're cautious. They did very well and we're all supporting them. But to have that flow through for the year here is premature.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Rod, and maybe I can just give you a little bit of an update on what we're doing with the business more strategically.","So the plan obviously was to sell and divest the thermostat and pipe, non-core product lines, and that's moving along as planned, Rod. So what that means is we've used the first quarter to really get some of the ground work done in terms of marketing the business. We'll be moving into that over the next 60 days.","And I would say, our early thoughts are it's a good opportunity and a good business for somebody. We're not the natural owner or the best owner for that business. But I would say we're comfortable, and I think we'll get a sale. We just need another quarter to go through the process, frankly, of engagement with potential buyers, and then I think we'll know more.","But we're encouraged by early interest in terms of being able to move that business out of our portfolio as we go through the year.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thank you. And just one more if I could just slip this in. It sounds like there's a pretty significant pickup in electrification and other technologies that are being added to comply with the regulation, particularly in Europe.","Was wondering if just from your perspective in speaking to customers, are you hearing about anything more strategic vis-\u00e0-vis their plans for Europe? There just seems to be a little bit more of a recognition that some segments are structurally challenged. And it's hard for your customers to pass along some of these cost increases. What do you think that might mean for you, just in terms of the volumes or those relationships over time?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. It's a good question, Rod. Our view is, I would say generally from certainly where we were six months or a year ago, the pace and acceleration towards electrification has increased in Europe for sure.","I think an element of that obviously is the transition from diesel to gas of course is accelerating that for obvious reasons. I would say too each OEM is kind of looking at it, what is best solution obviously for them uniquely with their portfolio.","But a couple of things that are fairly consistent. The march to 48-volt technology continues to gain momentum, and we see that 48-volt mild hybrid technology is the prevalent solution or a growing solution, if that makes sense. I would tell you, our quote activity in that space is intensified. And that's obviously great for BorgWarner because we've got clutching and motors to help provide that solution.","And then EVs are obviously in scope too. That varies a little bit by OEM, particularly on the fleet size and the fleet mix, right? But net-net, the march is definitely getting faster. It's getting stronger. And I would say 48-volt mild hybrid is surfacing to the top. And EVs, if anything, are getting pulled forward.","And they're all having to adjust quicker than they thought they would because of the diesel gas mix shift, if that helps you.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Okay, thank you.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thanks, Rod.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Good morning. Good morning. So on the organic growth, you outperformed your own prior expectations by 200 bps for the quarter at midpoint, even despite the diesel headwind and the lower industry production.","I think we have some of the elements of it here from your prepared remarks, but can we just pin down really what were some of the major contributing factors leading to that higher organic growth versus the outlook?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah, sure, Noah, this is James. The two things that I would say are the most meaningful, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, commercial vehicle was a little stronger. If you remember, we came into the year with a view that really no growth for commercial vehicle for us. And we saw some growth there in commercial vehicle. So that contributed probably 100 bps of, let's say, the better performance or stronger growth.","And then I would just say the overall view of the backlog in terms of launch was a little stronger, and that's a mixture there, Noah, some of the programs maybe came in slightly quicker, some ran a little faster than what we'd started into the year. And I would say those are the two kind of primary drivers of what allowed us to get a little bit higher than our organic growth, if that makes sense to you.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Yeah, no, that's very helpful. And then, the China show \u2013 the China Auto Show that's ongoing, clearly, the EV models are being showcased here, right, ahead of the quota requirements that are going to kick in. And then we've had the announcement around ownership liberalization.","And I was just wondering kind of what's your view of the potential impact to the business. Obviously, local content requirement on batteries, that doesn't impact your ability with your products to play in the market. Would this at all help you to increase your market share in electrification? How to think about that effect?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. I'd give you a couple of thoughts, Noah. So first off, I think you know this, that China is a major growth engine for us as a company and actually has been for the last year or two, for sure, and continues to be very strong. It was over 30% of our backlog that was derived from China.","The other data point I would tell you is we have seen over the last two or three years the fastest adoption of pure electric, battery electric vehicle technology has been in China, and we've been right there with that. If you look at some of the eGearDrive announcements that we've made over the last few quarters, that's evidence that we're strongly in there.","We've obviously also launched our electric drive module, which is a combination of both the motor and the gearbox.","And then the other thing I would share, Noah, that you may find useful is what we find particularly with the domestic OEMs adopting technology at a very fast pace. They really do rely quite heavily on propulsion system partners such as us.","And the reason for that is we bring all of the discrete technologies and can put them together as a system for them. And that's what we've seen in some of our bookings and some of our win rates.","So we found their adoption is aggressive and their reliance on partners such as us has been very strong. So all of that put together, we see tremendous EV growth in China. We're right there with them and we're seeing also more and more adoption of hybrid technology where we're also there. So, this is all super positive for BorgWarner and good for China as well, Noah.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks very much for the color.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Armintas Sinkevicius from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thank you for taking the question.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Good morning.","Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","You've made a lot of progress towards becoming propulsion agnostic. But when I look at the slide from Detroit or the Investor Day where you have the content per vehicle and the participation rate, the content per vehicle is going up as we transition to different architectures. But your participation is trending lower. I know it's early days, but can you help me think about where \u2013 how you think about being propulsion agnostic? And, in my mind, it would be where the content per vehicle times the participation rate starts to even out. And it's certainly moving in that direction. But do you see that ultimately as being the equilibrium? And if so, what are the factors to get there?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. So, yeah, this is James. Let me maybe give you a little bit of color on what we see. What may be useful is if maybe you've already got it arranged that way, having a more detailed discussion with Pat where he can actually walk you through the discrete specific numbers for content per vehicle and participation rate.","But in general, I would articulate it this way. First of all, obviously, we see growth across all three platforms: combustion, hybrid, and electric. From a combustion perspective, in a flat to declining marketplace of combustion over the next few years, we generally grow at about 5%, okay? So, that's primarily through additional content as they advance the technology in combustion-powered products. So, that's what's driving that growth.","On hybrid, we're actually increasing obviously our content per vehicle and the participation rate continues to grow. And that's coupled with two things. One, that the carryover of use in our combustion products in addition to the hybrid product. So, on hybrids, we grow both content and participation rate.","And on electrics, what you may be thinking about on electrics, if you go back a year or so back to 2016, our content per vehicle was exceptionally high. We were in the 600s and that was driven by we were only really shipping one single product called transmission.","And as we adopt an array of products, that content per vehicle actually comes down and narrows itself out, but our participation rate is going up from about 3% to 26% over the next two or three years. So, when you net all of that together, you net all of that together. We're going to end up with the combustion content per vehicle in the low-200s and hybrid content per vehicle in the mid-200s and the electric in the high-300s, so it's pretty consistent. And participation rates will be about 50% on combustion, mid-20s on electrics and mid-30s on hybrids. So, does that help you a little bit? Otherwise, I know Pat can give you the multiplier.","Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","It does. No, this is helpful. And then, Pat has been helpful as well. Just when I think about the transition electric, where you see the equilibrium on participation rate for yourselves? Do you see it sort of not by 2020, but sort of further out, do you see it higher than the mid-20% range and what do you need do to get there?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah, we'll climb beyond the mid-20s. I mean the mid-20s is a great number for us considering we're coming from 3% just a couple of years ago.","Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","But we'll get to that mid-20% and we'll climb from there. Absolutely, we'll climb from there because we \u2013 I have portfolio across the space, whether it's transmission, power, electronics. We will continue to climb. We don't have a definitive number of where that will settle out. But intuitively, if you think about it intuitively, why would there be any less participation on an electric than it would on a hybrid or a combustion? And I don't think it will. It's just a function to me of when we get there.","Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Well, thank you so much for taking the question.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Morning, Ryan.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Maybe just first regarding the modestly lowered EBIT margin guidance for the year. Thanks, Ron, for the comment on the economy impact. I imagine the FX tailwind to revenue was also diluting the all-in contribution margin. Are there any other factors that play such as a decision to spend more on investments electrification, other technologies to drive future sales growth or is pretty much accounted for by those other factors?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","It's accounted for those other factors and we are still maintaining our incremental margins right in the mid-teens, so no. It's those two of the factors, FX and then the reclassification of the pension.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. That's helpful.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","And, Ryan. Sorry, Ryan. Just \u2013 I just \u2013 Ron's right on, of course. But I just want to reiterate there is absolutely no spend slowdown at all in R&D. We continue to get at that pace of 4% or more across both \u2013 across over the portfolio. So, yeah, I don't want you to think we're touching R&D. If anything, we'll spend more not less.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Very helpful. And then just, James, I recall you saying a couple of years ago before Sevcon that you'd be happy to make a number of power electronics acquisitions whenever you \u2013 if you could. I'm just curious what other like power electronics capabilities exist out there that were maybe not addressed by the Sevcon acquisition that you could be potentially still interested in acquiring?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. I would say it's probably similar stuff to what we \u2013 what Sevcon brings, but just more of it, more scale, more engineering capacity, more engineering capability is really the key. We're happy with what we've got. We're doing good.","But as we're marching towards an $11 billion company and growing at the right we are, we're becoming a big company and it's a lot of activity we're managing. And if we can add more capability, more capacity, Ryan, it's only going to help us. I don't need to add other discrete products, if that makes sense to you, to the portfolio to deliver on the growth targets. We can do that with what we've got plus Sevcon. It would just be more of it, would be good, if that makes sense to you.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Yeah. No, that's great. Thanks. And then just the last question for me is, in the past, I think you've talked about like a breakout of the alternate powertrain mix in your backlog or for the industry as a whole. We see the IHS figure, kind of 5% to 6% DAV penetration in 2028. I think this is as far as they go. Just curious given all the anecdotal evidence and announcements we've seen from automakers over the past \u2013 even over the past six months or so, if you see anything shifting in your conversation with automakers, are your conversations still mostly tied to discussions around hybrids and NPFs?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. So, couple of thoughts, Ryan. One, obviously, as we get closer to \u2013 as we're getting into invested, I will do a refresh on that for you and give you the outlook of vehicle architecture breakdown based on IHS view and our view and others. Fundamentally, we've not seen a huge change from 6, 9, 12 months ago other than I would say the adoption or a push for 48-volt model hybrid. It continues to be strong and continues to get pushed not just in Europe, but different parts of the world as well. And you see a lot of announcements on pure electrics, which I think we're paying a lot of attention to.","So I wouldn't say there's been any meaningful big shift. I would just say we're getting close to those dates now, so there's a lot of drive to get these technologies in place and implemented. I think it's more that has changed a little over the last year. We're getting closer to implementation date, but 48-volt model hybrid coupled with some battery electric and then optimization of combustion is the primary drives that we're seeing in the business.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Very helpful. Thanks for all the color.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","All right. Thank you, Ryan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Hello, everyone.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Hey, Joe.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Hey, Joe.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So just on the diesel commentary, I know you said the market was down, I think, 760 basis points. Within that, one of the things we observed was sort of the smaller Engines declining at a faster rate than the larger Engines. Are you mostly aligned with sort of the industry mix or did you perhaps outperform or underperform based on your mix?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. So, yeah, Joe, this is James. The 760 basis points is the right number for the quarter. And you're right, it's biased to small. Vehicles are switching from out of diesel quicker, much quicker. We've seen that trend over the last 6 months to 12 months.","On average, Joe, it we're slightly weighted to the larger vehicles. I mean, I don't have any specific data point, but I would say generally we're a little more weighted to larger vehicles than smaller vehicles. So, we don't get as impacted as much in the average. We do a little better than the industry average because of that slight bias for us on the larger vehicles.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","One thing I will add, James \u2013 I'll add one thing, Joe, is if you're looking at the impact we actually experienced in Q1, it was in line with our guide of 300 basis points to 400 basis points. That's what we experienced, okay. We didn't experience the 760 basis points for the quarter.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. So, the drag to sales in the quarter was 300 basis points to 400 basis points, but then you also made a comment that commercial vehicle offset that. So, the inference is that commercial vehicle \u2013 and so (00:46:32) none of the two was in line or you're in line because you were expecting the zero on commercial vehicle.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Right.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. Yeah.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","What happened is commercial offsetting the guide that we thought we were going to experience and we still performed better than what the market did.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Right.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Okay?","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. The second one is just \u2013 so, I appreciate the comments on 48-volt and that makes a lot of sense given some of the near-term targets that the automakers have to hit. But presumably because of your capabilities, you're also involved in a lot of discussions with the automakers about where they go after, and I guess I'm curious about those conversations for sort of the next gen. Like, what are they thinking there? And I guess the reason I'm asking is, it seems like 48-volt could be this really strong growth, mid-term solution. But ultimately, it seems like maybe it gets transplanted by some of the other technologies in your other content.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. Let me say, if I can help with that, Joe. The first thing I would say to you is, we are absolutely involved in those discussions across the \u2013 around the world, so to speak, with all the automakers, which is interesting because we get a unique view of pretty much what all the automakers are doing. And the very conversations that we're having are, what is the optimal mix of propulsion technology for their range of vehicles both now and also through 2025 and even beyond 2025. The general trend that we see is, obviously, they all have their own unique mix. But what we're generally seeing is that all of them are looking towards a balanced fleet. So, we're not seeing a lot of will hybrid be an interim solution to use an example and everybody switching over to pure electrics. We're seeing even in a sustained period to 10 years out that they'll have a mix of really advanced combustion technology, which continues to get advanced pretty aggressively.","There will be a certain mix of hybrid and then there will be some \u2013 generally some EV portion of that fleet. So that's what we're consistently seeing. We're not seeing people jump into two of the three architectures as an example.","And I would also point out, I think you're right, 48-volt hybrid is a sustained solution. We don't see that as an interim fix, so to speak, to go to electric. Within the 48-volt mild hybrid architecture, the P2 solution, which is basically putting the motor between the engine and the transmission, seems to be a prevalent trend. We see that very, very clearly.","And I would say the investment in continuing to advance combustion to engine technology is still very strong. Sometimes we hear a myth that that's not happening. It's not true. There's a lot of investment and a lot of advanced technology that we're discussing on pure combustion.","So the difficulty is, Joe, it varies OEM-by-OEM and region-by-region, but those are some of the high-level trends that we're seeing, if that helps you.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah, no. That is helpful. I guess just one quick follow-up because you mentioned the sort of P2 configuration. Is there sort of a motor configuration that is generally more favorable for BorgWarner than the others? Or are you pretty agnostic between the different \u2013 where they place the motor?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","No, what we're finding, Joe, and maybe the reason, just for those on the call, of why the P2 solution lends itself very, very well, is it gives the OEMs the opportunity to use the current engine and transmission configuration that they have and basically put the P2 model in between, which then gives them flexibility to use that engine transmission as a combustion vehicle or a hybrid vehicle.","What's pretty unique for us, and this is pretty interesting, is if you actually list the companies in the world that understand engines, transmissions, clutching, motors and electronics, which are all the five elements needed to pull off a P2 mild hybrid solution, there is BorgWarner and I'm not sure who else frankly.","So all of that, that's the competitive advantage we're bringing. And we have a range of motor technology, Joe, so we can \u2013 we have different motors. And it varies again on the needs and the specific uniqueness of the application.","But because we understand the clutching and we understand the transmission and the engine, we know how to scale or adjust the motor for that particular application. And that's why we're gaining a lot of traction there and doing really well.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks. That's helpful.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris McNally with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Chris McNally - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Hey, guys, I really just wanted to discuss a little bit about the high-voltage industry outlook maybe more in detail and specifically the power electronics. Now that you have Sevcon for the last two quarters and you had a strong interest from the OEM. So, two questions.","The first is on really the bundling of the electric motor and power electronics. If you can give any qualitative or just some guidance for how much you're seeing those two bundled together as opposed to sort of bid out separately amongst different suppliers.","And then, the second on insourcing. I think you gave some comments last year that you thought on the electric motor side, that it was going to be about 50% insourced from OEMs. And we really don't have a good industry check on power electronics, outside of Tesla. It seems like most OEMs are going to outsource, but any color you can add there would be great.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah, let me take a shot at that for you. So I'll start with the \u2013 let me start with motors, so let's start there.","And you're right, Chris, our assumption was about 50% would be insourced and 50% outsourced by the OEs. And of that 50% that was outsourced to suppliers, we'd probably pick up about 15% thereabouts of that market share.","I would say the two things that I've seen since we talked about that is, I think the 50\/50, in versus out from the OEMs, I think, is pretty consistent. I'd just say that's still a pretty good assumption. If I had to do the over\/under, I think they'll do a little more out. He's just changed his view.","And our ability to win that 15%, I'm feeling incrementally more positive and more comfortable about. And I think we're probably running a little ahead of that. It's still early in the race, Chris, but I would say \u2013 directionally, I would say that's where I would go. So that \u2013 I would say that.","On power electronics, I agree with your sentiment that we \u2013 the OEs are generally leaning to outsourcing power electronics for sure. And then I would say in terms of your other thought in terms of the bundling of the package, that varies a little bit by the OEMs. I would say, generally speaking, the Chinese OEMs are much more lending themselves to bundling the whole thing, and we're seeing that play out pretty strongly.","Europe, North America probably a little more less so. But I will also say the other very critical point is, you, as a supplier, if you're going to compete, you need to understand all of those things and how they interact. That's what I've heard loud and clear from the OEM. So don't come to me with a transmission motor combo and not understand the electronics needed. You have to understand that even if it's outsourced and bid separately, Chris, if that makes sense. You got to understand the system, you got to understand the interactions and that's where we bring the value.","So hopefully that gives you a little bit of a sense from what you're thinking about.","Chris McNally - Evercore ISI","No, James, that's fantastic. And do you think, just as a quick follow-up on the bundling, I mean when you're going to the OEMs, is there a very strong value proposition that, if we are able to do both or able to offer x in terms of savings or efficiency because of essentially the design of what is the critical components in an EV. Or right now that value proposition is only so-so, not just for yourself, but for the industry, that combining those two, you're not really gaining a lot of efficiency?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. Again, I would say there is a little bit, Chris, OEM-to-OEM. But here's the way I think about it, is if you've got the capability to do all, you're in a much, much stronger position. You really are for two reasons.","One, you can understand the tradeoffs between the different pieces of technology, but also if you've got the capability to offer it, insource to offer it, to supply it, you have an advantage.","So it's still early, Chris. To be fair, it's playing itself out, but I would say in general you're way better off if you've got all pieces of the puzzle as opposed to only certain bits of the puzzle.","Chris McNally - Evercore ISI","Great.

Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Hello, John.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a question, I mean, on the Drivetrain business. Ron, when you were kind of going through the walk, you were talking just about how you'd benefited from mix there and what we're hearing on four-wheel drive, what we're hearing from the automakers is an increasing focus on crossovers and trucks in relation to potentially cancellation of many car program. Just curious as we think about the Drivetrain business, what kind of potential upside you see as we see the shift towards more crossovers and trucks that will have a lot more four-wheel drive or at least All-Wheel Drive toward transfer capability?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","I'll start, then maybe James would follow up. It's not just about transfer cases. It's also about coupling, so we have the coupling business. So, we see good growth in the first quarter in the coupling business in Europe, for example, and in China. So in the U.S., we all think about the trucks and the transfer cases, but it's not just about transfer case. It's about couplings as well. Do you want to add anything...","James R.

The only other thing I would say, John, it's not directly related to your question is, not to beat a dead horse here, but this notion of having the broad elements of Drivetrain, all the key pieces of Drivetrain in addition to the Engine piece is a huge competitive advantage because you can understand both parts of the vehicle. That's a big advantage for us.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","But I mean, simplistically, directly from a pass car to a crossover to a truck, I mean, what is the content potential for you in Drivetrain just sort of on a more traditional standpoint?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, the biggest thing that moves the needle is the transfer case. So, that's the biggest shift for us, if that makes sense, John. So think of the other key pieces here. We have pretty much equal content of transmission across the vehicle, but transfer case is obviously an additive to trucks and obviously four-wheel drive applications. So, that's the biggest shift you see. We see \u2013 the rise in China of more and more and more SUVs is calling on more functionality for All-Wheel Drive or four-wheel drive and also calling for dual-clutch type applications because they're better equipped in an SUV. So, we're seeing some of those trends, if that makes sense.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, that's helpful. And then just a second question, can you just remind us what your commercial vehicle exposure is there because it sounds like the market is running a whole lot hotter than flat or is going to run a whole lot hotter than flat this year. I'm just trying to understand what the potential upside is from that as well.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","In China, John? You're asking about China?","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","No, more North America, but also potentially China as well.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","So, CV is about 12% of revenue, total company, and it's about a third in the North America, a third in Europe and the other third is split between China and Brazil, weighted to China. And about total CV, about two-thirds is over the road and about one-third off-the-road. Is that helps?","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And profitability on that, if you guys \u2013 would you guys do, is that sort of a round corp average or is there a higher profile there?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","It's round corp average.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thanks, John.","Operator","We have time for one final question and that question comes from the line of Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Hey, Rich.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Hello, Rich.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Just a couple here for 2018 on the guide. So, implies second half organic growth slows down, production comps particularly in North America get easier. Is that backlog timing or anything we should be reading into with regard to conservatism?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","I don't think it's anything to read into. It's early right now into the year. We're only five months in \u2013 four months in, Rich. I don't think there's anything to read into that at this point, okay?","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then on the equity and affiliates.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So, that number is going to be a headwind. So, it's going to be down year-over-year. That's, I think, related to \u2013 you have Korean and Japanese joint venture. There's something else there not just production or is there programs or what's driving the lower contribution?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","So, I call that leakage, basically. So, there's two elements to loan line that we want to make you guys focus on. There's affiliates and then there's the equity, right. Both of them are headwinds. One of them on the joint venture is what's happening is, as we make more money in those joint ventures, we have to give them more money because we don't have 100% ownership. So, that will increase. For example, the dual-clutch transmission for the Chinese OEMs is a good example. So as we do better there, we have to give our partners. And then we are seeing startup in NSK-Warner expansion plans, and we're anticipating that this should go through some cost issues as they expand their business.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. So that was the one I was looking for, I understand the DCP piece with minority interest (01:01:04)...","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","All right, yeah. So, it's basically the expansion of NSK-Warner partnership that we had over 50 years.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. So, there's some investment going on there, okay.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","All right, yes.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That's great. Okay, that's all I had. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","All right.","James R.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Ken Lamb, Director, Investor Relations. Mr. Lamb, you may begin your conference.","Ken Lamb","Thank you, Brandy. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us.","We issued our earnings release this morning at approximately 8 a.m. Eastern time. It's posted on our website, borgwarner.com, on our homepage.","A replay of today's conference call will be available through August 3. The dial-in number for that replay is (800) 642-1687.

Tim Manganello, Chairman and CEO, will comment on the second quarter and current industry trends. And then Ron Hundzinski, our CFO, will discuss the details of our operating results and also our outlook for the remainder of 2012. Also on the call, we'll have James Verrier, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Robin Adams, Vice Chairman and Chief Administrative Officer.","With that, I'll turn it over to Tim.","Timothy M. Manganello","Thank you, Ken, and good day, everyone. Today, I'm very pleased to review our strong second quarter results, as well as our second quarter accomplishments.","First, our second quarter results. Reported sales were $1.9 billion, up 2% from the same period last year. However, foreign currencies were working against us during the quarter. On a comparable basis, excluding currency, BorgWarner sales were up nearly 10% versus about 2% for the global market if you exclude total Japanese vehicle production. U.S. GAAP earnings were $1 per share. Excluding noncomparable items, our earnings were $1.36 per share, a new record for the company. Our reported operating income margin was 10.4%. Excluding the impact of noncomparable items, our operating income margin was 12.5%, also a new record. This is an outstanding margin performance in a very challenging market.","Two key factors drove our results. Increased global demand for our products and efficient execution by our operating units. And on the Engine Group, second quarter sales were about $1.3 billion, down 2% from a year ago. However, sales were up 7%, excluding currency and 2011 divestitures. The Engine Group continues to perform very well and results were led by strong sales growth in the engine timing systems, including variable cam timing; greater sales of emissions products; and higher turbochargers sales in Asia and North America. In the quarter, the Engine Group margin was 16.6%, another all-time record.","Now the Drivetrain Group also had strong second quarter results. Sales were about $590 million, up 13% from the second quarter 2011. Excluding currency, sales were up 20%. Drivetrain results were driven by increased sales of DCT modules in Europe; growth in our traditional automatic transmission components in North America and Korea; and higher sales of all-wheel-drive systems around the world. In the quarter, the Drivetrain Group margin was 9.2%, up from a year ago. And Drivetrain Group is still on target to achieve a 9% or better operating margin we expect for the full year.","Now BorgWarner also continues to reinvest in our business. Our near-term capital spending plan includes increased capacity for dual-clutch transmission modules in Europe, engine timing systems in Asia, transfer cases in North America and turbochargers all over the world.","Now for the quarter, we spent about 5% of sales on CapEx and continued to invest in technology, which is a lifeblood of our company. We spent about 3.6% of sales in R&D for the quarter.","Now I'm also proud to review some exciting accomplishments and announcements that we made during the quarter. BorgWarner's silent chain and compact hydraulic tensioner helped improve fuel economy for Daihatsu's 660cc I3 engine. In fact, Daihatsu presented us with a Supplier's Excellence Award for our contributions towards their engine's outstanding fuel economy. The engine launched on the Mira e:S and will drive several other minicars for the Japanese market. BorgWarner is also supplying turbochargers for BYD's new 1.5-liter GDI engine. This is the first GDI engine ever developed in-house by a domestic Chinese OEM. The engine launched in the top selling G6 sedan and will be available for other models. The engine is also Euro 5 compliant. BorgWarner's friction plates enabled ZF's new full hybrid 8-speed automatic transmission to shift smoothly between the electric motor and the engine. The transmission launched in the 2012 Audi Q5 Hybrid Quattro. It will also be featured in other vehicles soon. And BorgWarner recently announced the sale of its spark plug business, part of the BERU acquisition in 2005. Sales were approximately $80 million in 2011 and this will allow us to continue our focus on expanding BERU's core product lines, including glow plugs, diesel cold start systems and other gasoline ignition systems, including EcoFlash.","Now on a personal note, I would like to congratulate the winners of this year's BorgWarner innovation awards. We honored over 90 employees for their outstanding contributions and operational excellence, collaboration, customer excellence and product development. Their passion and entrepreneurial spirit addressed real-world challenges and helped BorgWarner maintain its reputation as the technology leader for fuel economy, emissions and performance.","So now let's take a look at our current outlook for 2012 light vehicle production. In North America, we now expect 14% year-over-year growth compared with our previous outlook of 11%. Strong monthly sales, better credit conditions and strong fleet demand have improved our outlook. Japanese OEMs continue to replenish their inventory and this is also driving a significant portion of this year's growth in North America. Our outlook for Europe is less optimistic. We are forecasting a 6% decline in annual production volumes and this appears to be in line with our previous guidance, or forecast, but our new outlook continues more -- includes more positive results in the first half that are offset by lower projections for the rest of the year. We expect more production cuts by French OEMs and weaker sales in France, Italy, Spain, for small cars. We also forecast slight production cuts in large- and medium-sized or mid-sized passenger cars. We have less conviction about this market segment than we did in January when we made our original guidance. In China, we now project 6% annual production growth, down slightly from 7% previously. Now looking at the rest of the year, our projection for global light vehicle production for the second half of 2012 light vehicle production as compared with the second half of 2011 production is relatively flat. Now given this, BorgWarner still expects to outperform the market by 8% to 10% on a comparable basis. Our 2012 outlook for the commercial truck market has also weakened. In all 4 markets where we compete -- Europe, North America, Brazil and China -- projected volumes have decreased. We still expect low double-digit growth in North America in 2012, but the other 3 markets are expected to contract.","So finally, let's review our updated sales and earnings guidance. Our sales growth in 2012 is now expected to be 4% to 6% compared with our previous guidance of 10% to 12%. Excluding currency, our sales growth is now expected to be 9% to 11% compared with our previous guidance of 14% to 16%. The change in our sales guidance is primarily due to weakening global economy conditions and weaker foreign currencies. Despite weakening market conditions, we expect our sales growth to outperform the market for this year, and Ron will cover that shortly.","Our 2012 earnings guidance, excluding noncomparable items, is now $5.05 to $5.25 per share, down from the $5.35 to $5.65 per share previously. The change is primarily due to our expectation of lower sales, weaker foreign currencies and higher effective tax rates. Again, Ron will discuss these items later.","Our operating margin is still expected to be better than the 11.5% for the year. The 12.1% operating margin that we posted in the first half of this year, excluding noncomparable items, provides great momentum towards achieving this target and is a great start for the year.","Now in conclusion, we have lowered our expectation for the remainder of the year but feel confident about our current guidance. We still expect to grow sales and profits in every major region of the world. And as I said earlier, we expect to outperform the market by 8% to 10% on a comparable basis. The new guidance still represents a record year for BorgWarner with an EPS increase of 13% to 18% over 2011. This is in spite of currency, volume and tax rate headwinds. So like I said many times, no company in the auto sector is better positioned to absorb short-term market fluctuations and to deliver long-term profitable growth than BorgWarner. I'm very proud and feel very good about our company's future and so should our shareholders.","And now I'll turn the meeting over to Ron.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Good day, everyone. Before I begin reviewing the financials, I would like to put BorgWarner's performance into perspective within the larger auto industry.","In the auto industry, global light vehicle production was up 10% in the second quarter compared with the same quarter last year. However, a substantial portion of that growth was related to Japanese vehicle manufacturers and their Q2 2011 tsunami-related production interruptions. So excluding the Japanese impact, global production was up less than 2% in the quarter. BorgWarner sales were up 2% from a year ago on a reported basis. As Tim explained earlier, if we exclude the impact of foreign currencies and M&A activity in 2011, our reported sales were up 10% in the quarter. Therefore, on a Japanese -- what I'm calling a Japanese tsunami adjusted comparable basis, the company outperformed the market by our typical 8% to 10% points in the second quarter. The favorable impact of the Japanese tsunami production recovery can be seen in our equity and affiliates earnings line, which was up 55% over 2011.","Working down to income statement, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 20.6% for the quarter. That's up from 19.6% a year ago despite about $9 million in higher raw material prices. SG&A expenses were 8.2% of sales in the quarter versus 8.7% of sales in the second quarter last year. As a percentage of sales, R&D was 3.6%, in line with a year ago. Reported operating income in the quarter was $193 million, however, this includes a $38 million charge related to the disposal activities associated with the sale of our spark plug business. This charge shows up in other income expense line item of the income statement.","Note that we anticipate future restructuring charges related to the sale of our spark plug business in the third quarter when the pending sale was closed. Excluding the $38 million charge, operating income was $230 million, or 12.5% of sales, compared with $199 million or 11% of sales on a comparable basis a year ago. This is 150 basis point improvement, which reflects outstanding cost controls.","After excluding the impact of foreign currency and noncomparable items in both this quarter and the second quarter 2011, our incremental margin was about 26% in the quarter.","As you look further down the income statement, equity and affiliate earnings was up $13 million, up over 50% from $8 million last year. This is where you see the Japanese effect for us on the favorable side. This represents a performance of, like I said, NSK-Warner 50-50 joint venture in Japan, which sells transmission components to our Japanese customers in Japan and China, as well as TEL, our turbocharger joint venture in India. The 50% year-over-year increase reflects our participation in the Japanese market growth, which due to accounting rules, do not allow us to show it in the top line sales numbers.","Interest expense and finance charges were $13 million in the quarter, down $21 million a year ago. This was primarily due to the maturity of our convertible debt settled in treasury shares in mid-April. Note that this reduction in convertible related interest expense will not impact earnings per share since it has been excluded from our earnings per share calculations since the first quarter of 2010. We have been calculating EPS on an if-converted basis since then.","Provision for income taxes was $69 million in the quarter. That equates to an effective tax rate of 35% on a GAAP basis. The provision includes 2 non-reoccurring items. The tax impact of the spark plug business transaction and an adjustment to our tax accounts reflecting new assumptions for the repatriation of earnings generated in certain foreign countries. Earnings generated in those certain foreign countries will no longer be permanently reinvested in those countries but instead will be available for repatriation back to the United States. This gives us future flexibility but it does come at a cost. Future profits generated in those jurisdictions will be taxed at the higher U.S. rate. This will affect our tax rate going forward. And as a result, our estimate for our full year effective tax rate, excluding noncomparable items, is now 27%. Also, an adjustment is required to true up the tax rate applied to those earnings previously generated in those jurisdictions to the higher U.S. tax rate, sort of a catch up. This noncomparable item shows up in the income tax line item of our income statement in the quarter.","Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest was $5.6 million in the quarter, up slightly from $5.3 million a year ago. This line reflects our minority partners share in earnings performance of our Korean and Chinese consolidated joint ventures. The year-over-year increase reflects the growth in those businesses. This brings us back to net earnings which was $121 million in the quarter, or $1 per share, on a reported basis. On a comparable basis, net earnings were $164 million in the quarter, or $1.36 per share, up from $1.12 per share a year ago. That's a 21% earnings growth on 10% sales growth, excellent performance for the company for the quarter.","Now let's look closer at our operating groups.","Engine Group sales were $1.3 billion in the quarter. Excluding currency and 2011 dispositions, Engine Group sales were up 7% compared with the second quarter of 2011. We are seeing good growth in engine timing, including VCT, emission systems and turbochargers. However, the slowdown in light vehicle production in Southern Europe and in the commercial vehicle markets in Europe and China has had an impact. Adjusted EBIT for the Engine Group was $211 million in the quarter or 16.6% of sales, that's a significant improvement from the 15.2% adjusted EBIT margin reported a year ago and a new record for the Engine Group. The year-over-year incremental margin was 31%, excluding currency in 2011 dispositions, a very strong operational performance by the Engine Group.","In the Drivetrain Group, sales were $594 million in the quarter. Excluding currency, Drivetrain Group sales were up 20% compared with the second quarter of 2011. Strong all-wheel drive system sales around the world, growth in traditional transmission component, sales in North America and Korea and higher dual-clutch transmission modules sales in Europe are key growth drivers.","On a reported basis, adjusted EBIT was $55 million or 9.2% of sales, significantly higher than the 7.4% reported in the second quarter of 2011.","As Tim said earlier, the first half performance provides a solid foundation for the Drivetrain Group to achieve EBIT margins of 9% or better this year. The year-over-year incremental margin for the Drivetrain Group was 18%, excluding currency -- excellent all-around performance for the Drivetrain Group.","If you look at the balance sheet and cash flow, we generated about $310 million of net cash from operating activities in the first half of 2012, that's up $60 million from the first half of 2011. Capital spending was $188 million in the first half of 2012, up $28 million for the same period a year ago. This year-over-year increase is required to support our program launches around the world, particularly in Asia, South America, Eastern Europe, Mexico.","Free cash flow, which we define as net cash from operating activities less capital spending, including tooling, was $122 million. Looking at the balance sheet itself, balance sheet debt increased by $176 million compared with the end of 2011. Cash increased by $122 million during the same period. This $298 million decrease in net debt was primarily due to the maturity of our convertible debt, partially offset by our typical seasonal investment in working capital and the first quarter share repurchases we did this year.","During the first half of 2012, we purchased approximately 2.9 million shares. That left us with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 18.6% at the end of the second quarter compared with 28.3% at the end of 2011. Net debt to EBITDA at the end of the second quarter 2012 on a trailing 12-month basis was 0.6x. Our capital structure remains in excellent shape.","Now I would like to discuss our guidance for 2012. As Tim mentioned earlier, our sales growth and earnings guidance has changed. We now expect sales growth between 4% to 6% compared with our previous guidance of 10% to 12%. Excluding currency, our sales growth is now expected to be 9% to 11% compared with our previous guidance of 14% to 16%. On a reported basis, that's a 6% decline in growth expectations. 1% is due to weaker currencies, the remaining 5% is due to weaker global economic conditions, primarily in Europe. However, we still expect our sales growth to outpace the market. We expect global production to be virtually flat in the second half of the year compared to second half of 2011, just like Tim mentioned earlier. During the same period, we expect our sales growth to be in our typical range of 8% to 10%, excluding currency and 2011 and '12 dispositions. We now expect our earnings to be within a range of $5.05 to $5.25 per diluted share compared with our previous guidance of $5.35 to $5.65 per diluted share. That's a $0.35 per share decline midpoint to midpoint. Of the $0.35 per share decline, $0.06 of the share decline is due to weaker foreign currencies, $0.08 is due to higher estimated effective tax rate, which is now at 27%; both of those are partially offset by favorable impact of share repurchases in the quarter and the remaining decline is due primarily to lower sales volumes driven by weakening economic conditions. Our updated guidance implies continued strong performance on the cost side and implies a decremental margin of approximately 20% on the lower sales.","From a margin perspective, we still expect to achieve an operating margin of better than 11.5% for the full year. Our first half operating margin was 12.1%. It's a great start toward meeting that goal. However, we still need to get through the third quarter, which traditionally is a lower margin quarter due to customer summer shutdowns and model year changeovers. Year-over-year, incremental margin should be around 20%. We still believe that the impact of higher raw material costs will be in the $25 million to $30 million range in 2012. And as we said on our last earnings call, we will absorb and manage our inflationary costs, including raw materials. We will not permit them to have material impact to earnings expectations for the year.","To summarize, our sales will outperform the global market Japanese tsunami-adjusted once again by 8 to 10 percentage points, which is our target. Our second quarter operating margins and earnings per share were all-time records for the company on a run-rate basis. The Engine Group margin was also a new record. The Drivetrain Group continues its strong sales growth and margin performance. The first half of 2012 was a very good start to the year. Weakening market conditions have resulted in a lower outlook for our sales growth and earnings growth for 2012, however, our overall growth story continues as we expect to outperform the global market for the rest of the year by our traditional 8 to 10 percentage points above the market top line growth rate.","2012 should be another year of solid growth, record margins and record profits for BorgWarner. And as we observe the trends in the market, we see more industry-leading growth and more record profits beyond 2012. Our confidence is based on a proven business strategy. Fuel costs continued to trend higher and the regulatory environment continues to become more stringent and yet drivers continue to demand better performance. BorgWarner's focus on advanced technologies to improve fuel economy, reduce emissions and enhance performance is right on target. We expect strong demand for our products to continue for years to come. Our technology leadership, strong global presence, financial discipline and focus on attracting and maintaining a talented workforce have been the keys to BorgWarner's long-term success.","With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Ken.","Ken Lamb","Thanks, Ron. Now let's move to the Q&A portion of the call. Ron and James Verrier will be taking your questions. I would ask the call coordinator to please announce the Q&A procedures.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Ron, digging into the guidance a little bit. I thought the FX -- negative FX impact would have been a little greater. So just curious, what do you assume for the euro for the back half of the year?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","The full-year guidance now is $1.27. If you like to look at year-to-date, it was about $1.30 slightly under. That was our guidance. Our guidance was $1.30, which is where we -- --  we're pretty much year-to-date. So the back half, obviously, is where the deterioration is coming and I'm taking an average on the back half that comes down to like a $1.22, $1.24 range. I think the spot rate was maybe $1.21 yesterday.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So there's some seepage if we stay at $1.20 or so here.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Yes, that's correct. There would be, yes.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, Tim, on the commercial vehicle guidance, North America still low double-digit growth. I think we had pretty good growth in the first half. So what does that imply for the second half because there's seems to be some potentially some backlogs coming down here and there could be some production cuts. What are you factoring in for second half for North America commercial?","Timothy M. Manganello","Rich, this is Tim. I'm going to let James answer that, okay?","James R. Verrier","What we're seeing in the second half is just a little slower than the first half growth on commercial truck in North America, Rich.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So no big step down in commercial vehicle production first half to second half?","James R. Verrier","No, no.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","There was some slighter -- some slightly-less positive growth.","James R. Verrier","Yes, you're right, Rich. It's just a little bit lighter. Nothing dramatic or nothing significant. But just [indiscernible].","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay. And then, Tim or James, could you just comment on quoting activity? You've had a couple of pretty good quarters in a row in Q4 and Q1. How did quoting activity play out this quarter?","James R. Verrier","Yes. The second quarter, Rich, was another strong quarter of quoting activity for us. I actually looked at -- if you look at the first and second half, so -- the first half of the year, I'm sorry, is a record for us. Very, very strong quoting activity. And I would say the good news is it's in all regions of the world and it's across all of our product segments. So we feel very proud. But it's a very, very strong first and second quarter for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Ron, another question on the guidance. It looks like about $0.25 of your guidance cut is actually coming from lower volumes or just a weaker macro. But I think you said that you're still looking for Europe down 6%, which is where you were before and you still have North America commercial vehicle up low double-digits. So what exactly is driving that, is it all European light vehicle?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","The majority of it is European light vehicle, correct. If you take a look at Europe, IHS came in after the first quarter was finished and actually upped the production volume. So if we kept 6% for the full year, that meant that, that reduction in the second half of the year had to come down further and that's what basically we're looking at, is a lower outlook in Europe in the second half from what we saw previously.","James R. Verrier","Just maybe try to comment, Ravi, this is James. The second -- if you look at the second half for the year for European light vehicle production versus our prior forecast, it's about a 4% reduction versus our prior outlook.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. Can you give as for the full year what you're expecting for your European light vehicle business, I think you've given that number before.","Timothy M. Manganello","Year-over-year production?","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Your European light vehicle business revenue.","Timothy M. Manganello","Down 6% -- market.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And for you guys?","James R. Verrier","For us in Europe, we're actually up, Ravi, for the full year and that's in the first half and the second half.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So you're still going to be up for the full year?","James R. Verrier","Yes. For the full year, in Europe, we're up. If you exclude currency, we're up about 5% in Europe on light vehicle production.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. Yes, that's what I was looking for.","James R. Verrier","Ravi, just one other comment maybe help a little bit. I give the change in the second half of the year from what we saw earlier in the year. In absolute numbers, the second half is down about 7% in Europe in light vehicle production and we -- we're outperforming that significantly.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. Just moving to Q2 itself. The Drivetrain margin was down sequentially when, I think, typically your Drivetrain margin goes up 2Q versus 1Q. Anything going on there or is it just a reflection of what's going on in the macro?","James R. Verrier","No. Ravi, I would maybe describe it this way. When we look at the first half of the year for our Drivetrain performance, now that's an operating margin around 9.5%, which we feel very, very good about when you look at it versus where we were last year. And it's absolutely, I think, in line with where we've guided, where we are going to be coming out. You get a little bit of a noise just quarter-to-quarter but that's just more operational stuff going on. It's nothing significant just natural quarter-to-quarter, small percentage variations.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And finally, a couple of housekeeping items. Ron, I think, given the incentive comp delta versus last year in 2Q, also do you have updated guidance for free cash flow for the year?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","No. We have not changed free cash flow guidance for the year. They will remain the same. CapEx will remain the same as well.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So you have EPS coming down, but you have FCF unchanged?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Correct.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And incentive comp for the quarter?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","We froze the plans in the first quarter. So we don't have those large variations that we've seen in the past. So from a sequential basis going forward, you won't see large changes. However, I will state that the first quarter, we did record an amount in order to freeze the plan, the cash portion of that plan, which is on a sequential basis, there is a difference but going forward, it's going to be relatively the same.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Stover with Guggenheim Securities.","Matthew T. Stover - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. Number one is I want to make sure I had the numbers right. In the revised guidance, the FX portion on the sales was 1% and on the EPS line, it was $0.06.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","It was. Yes, that's correct.","Matthew T. Stover - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","That seems like an awfully large passthrough on the FX. Is there something unusual going on?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","No. That's in line, 1%. It's $80 million, $90 million or so, I think, it was on the value. Remember that's only for the back half of the year. Our guidance was $1.30. It's an average rate we use.","Matthew T. Stover - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Because I was looking -- the back half of the year last year, 1% delta is about $35 million and $0.06 is about $10 million pretax.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","We're 1% for the full year.","Matthew T. Stover - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Oh, 1% for the full year, okay. The second thing is in Europe, as you consider the revision of the guidance and sort of the macro uncertainty, your customers have been -- the earnings calls thus far expressed a greater degree of uncertainty as it relates to Europe, which would imply to me that the predictability of their schedules in the second half would be going down. And as you thought about the production assumptions underlying the second half, are you making any special adjustments with respect to customer that is either more or less optimistic than what you're seeing in the market right now? Because it would just seem that to take the guidance of production down below the 6% in the current environment might be more prudent.","James R. Verrier","No. I think we feel pretty good about the numbers we've given out there in terms of outlook. I agree with you there's natural continued uncertainty in that region of the world and there is certainly instability. But we feel pretty solid about the projections that we're making and as we said earlier, they're down 7% versus our prior guidance, so we feel we're very close to our customers in understanding their schedules. Obviously, we look at a lot of macroeconomic indicators as well and compare them with IHS-type data. So we feel pretty, pretty good about where we're guiding to. I would make one other comment, though. As we demonstrated year-to-date and also in prior years, if those numbers do fluctuate a little bit, we've done historically a very, very good job of adjusting costs in line with those reductions and we continue to feel good about our ability to flex our workforce and our cost structure. So may move another percent or so possibly, but we're ready for that if that comes along.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Leiker with Robert W. Baird & Co.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess, to start off here. In past years, you've had a lot of upside opportunity from your backlog being pulled ahead, some of it showing up sooner than what you expected. What are you seeing in terms of that dynamic this year? Is it being pulled ahead, is it as you expected, is some of it getting pushed out?","James R. Verrier","I would say, David -- this is James. Slightly a little bit of a pushout as opposed to pulling in. I wouldn't say it's anything that significant but we're seeing just some small pushout would be the general view overall.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And how much of -- I don't recall this number, but in Europe, how much commercial vehicle, how much of your European revenue is commercial vehicle?","James R. Verrier","About 5%.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","5%. And how's that -- is there any way you can characterize in your backlog how much of that might have been driven by commercial vehicle, Euro 6 emission standards? Was that a big opportunity -- is that a big opportunity for you in the backlog?","Timothy M. Manganello","Dave, I don't know if we could give you the answer right now. I'm sure it's an opportunity for us. We'd have to probably get back with you, or Ken would, on that, more details.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then in Brazil, I know you have a little bit of exposure there. We haven't really talked about that at all. Is that meaningful enough to move the needle one way or the other?","James R. Verrier","No, our European piece is not a significant piece for us. It is pretty much exclusively commercial vehicle business, David. But it's not a significant piece of our business.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And lastly on China. Where are you in terms of building out your asset base there to launch the backlog of the business that you have there? I know you have several facilities that you've been putting up, but where are you on that?","James R. Verrier","Yes. We're continuing, David, to increase investments pretty well across the majority of our product lines in China. Ningbo is our primary campus where we produce a lot of our engine-based products and we've -- through this year, we're expanding both facility and equipment, obviously, in the facility, and we're also expanding in our Drivetrain segment, primarily in Dalian and Beijing. So those plans are continuing on and our performance for the Chinese market continues to be very, very strong, both this year and in future years. So we feel very good about placing that investment in to be ready for that growth that we'll see.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I think your China business is almost all automotive, right? I don't think there's any commercial vehicle there. Is that right?","James R. Verrier","Yes, we have a little bit of commercial vehicle business but you're right, the vast majority is certainly light vehicle.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just wanted to go back to the guidance. I was hoping we could walk through the change in the ex currency sales growth of 14% to 16% to now 9% to 11%. Because production forecast didn't come down all that much. So you mentioned maybe the push out on backlog. It would be great if you could quantify that. And also are you seeing anything in terms of price downs or commercial settlement agreements changing around? Trying to get a bit more color on that walk.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","We did not change the guidance in Europe on total year-over-year sale of volumes being down 6%. But I think we said earlier, what we did see is a shift from the first half to the second half that deteriorated in the second half from what we saw prior once IHS updated the first quarter production numbers. So basically, sequentially, we see a decrease in the second half of 7% sequentially going forward. And that's where most of the deterioration is coming from is basically a rebalancing of the year.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Any change at all in the pricing activity with customers, commercial settlement agreements?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","We're always a target for pricing. That activity continues day in and day out. I wouldn't say anything changed. Those pressures are always there.","James R. Verrier","Yes.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And just on the second half on margins, you guys had a terrific margin in the second quarter and really the first half. It looks like revenue, I guess, sequentially is sort of flattish in the second half for the year. So what brings that margin down? Is it just sort of the typical seasonality and the shutdowns or if you can you help us out in terms of the walk, H2 versus H1 on the operating margins?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","I think you're right. The third quarter is an extremely low margin quarter historically because of the sequential reduction from the second quarter in sales. Then it rebounds in the fourth quarter. But I think the second -- the third quarter is what tends to drag that margin down is the third quarter.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. Just lastly, any initial thoughts for the tax rate next year? Is that 27% still a good placeholder for now or does it go up by...","Ronald T. Hundzinski","We'll update guidance going into next year. At this point, it's 27% sort of run out this year. We'll evaluate that for next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a first question and a follow-up on Europe. I mean, obviously, there's a lot of variability there. I'm just curious if we look at the back half of this year and potentially next year. If things are much worse than expected, which is a possibility, could you remind us the levers that you have to pull to respond to that potential weakness?","James R. Verrier","Yes. John, I would -- yes, we have a number of levers and I would say that primarily, we've got a lot more flexibility in our workforce. That's really one of the key things that we have in place. Historically, we've carried a percentage of temporary employees in the single-digit percentage range. We made some conscious choices over the last couple of years to increase that to the 20%-ish type of a number. And that's really a major, major advantage that we have and we'll absolutely use those levers to manage appropriately as volumes come up or down. So we feel very good about having that in place.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then the second question, just a follow-up on backlog. I mean, it does sound like there's some pushing and pulling and tugging there. But you haven't seen any changes or cancellations in programs or anything like that and it sounds like the bidding activity is going pretty strong. So is it fair to characterize the quoting activity and capital allocation in the industry towards your products has really not changed in response to this macroenvironment whatsoever?","James R. Verrier","I would absolutely say yes. There's no fundamental change. I think it's natural you'll get some small pushes or small adjustments whether that be a launch may move out a quarter or some of the new business could be adjusted very slightly. But fundamentally, the growth story is intact, the need for our products is as strong as it's ever been. And as Ron outlined earlier, John, when you look at our second half of the year, that out-performance continues on versus the marketplace. And specifically, we're not seeing any cancellation of programs or projects, not at all, not for our product.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","John, this is Ron. I would just add that our capital spending program is still on track and that's another indicator, I think, that you can look at.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And that brings me to my last question here, Ron, for you. As we look at the balance sheet strength, obviously, you're in a great position. Just trying to understand capital allocation, and where you're going to put your excess capital. Because it seems like you have that high-class issue of having a lot of extra cash in capital and also sort of in conjunction with that, why repatriate earnings if you're going to pay higher taxes on that? I'm just trying to understand why you think you need that money flow back to the U.S. and why not reinvest it internationally?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Well, first of all, I don't -- on a cash basis, I'm going to make sure this is clear. I don't pay the tax in cash until I repatriate it. So I just want to be clear there. But I'm setting myself up more for flexibility and in the countries or the units that we identified, the need for keeping that cash there for investments are no longer really required. So it's not very efficient just to keep the cash there if it's not really needed. So I'm setting myself flexibility. I'm going to really allocate that cash into the areas of the world that's more use for that cash. So it's a more of identifying those units not being able to consume that cash, John.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And the balance sheet strength. I mean, is there a share buyback on the horizon, God forbid a dividend if we get some relief on taxes? And obviously, I'm sure policy is a real hurdle there. I'm just trying to understand in return of cash to shareholders.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Well, we've talked about this in the past. M&A activity takes #1 priority and we have a lot of projects we're working on. That's #1. From that point on, I did do some buyback as you saw in the second quarter, as I just announced. That was more -- just an opportunity at that point from what I saw the share price at and what we think intrinsic value is ourselves. And then we review dividends annually with the board. And I think dividends is a bigger discussion around tax strategies for the company and personal income taxes. And I'm hoping that the U.S. government make some tax changes coming here next spring, or hopefully next year, that gives them some opportunities in that area.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But the dividend is very much tax-dependent, tax policy dependent, right?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","I wouldn't say it's dependent. That's one element that we look into, that we consider for it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","You're going to think I'm kind of sick here for asking the same question again, but I just would appreciate if I just can get a little bit of help here understanding it. Your full year top line guidance organically went from 14% to 16%, down to 9% to 11%. You did say, okay, there is a shift in Europe from the first half to the second half. But your full year, again, your full year numbers are still down 6%. So that doesn't affect your guidance. You did talk a little bit about commercial vehicle in China being revised slightly. But that is again not -- doesn't seem like that's sufficient to drive that down. What am I missing in terms of that full year downward revision? You cited the French and Italian automakers. I'm not sure, I think, that they were only like 6% or 7% of your overall European sales. Is there something happening with respect to mix?","James R. Verrier","I think a couple of things, Rod. This is James. Again, lots of -- maybe keep going through it but the second half of the year in European light vehicle, as I said, is down 7% year-over-year. But I think most critically, when you look at it versus where we are at with our prior guidance, we've reduced the second half of Europe by 4% and that's a very, very meaningful adjustment that we've made. The other part that we talked about earlier was we're guiding down in all commercial vehicle markets with the exception of North America. So we've seen deterioration in China where we participate, Europe where we participate and Brazil. So it's not purely the light vehicle Europe piece, Rod, there is an effect of commercial vehicle, pretty much globally with the exception of North America.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","I'll just point out, Rod, that the back half of the year is flat in production and we're still up 8 to 10 percentage points year-over-year. I just want to point that out. So we're still growing.","Timothy M. Manganello","Rod, this is Tim. This may help you a little bit. We have North America up about a little over 6% for the second half of the year as compared to 2011. We have Europe down 7% as James and Ron said a couple of times. We have China up about 8% for the second half of the year over 2011. But then you get into Japan, we have Japan down 6.5% as compared to the second half of last year globally. And then Korea is flat. So that may help you understand why it's not just Europe, okay? You have a down Korea and you have a down Japan.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And if we're doing the math right, your margins in the second half of '12 versus the second half of '11, you're talking about maybe 11% to 11.5% in the second half of this year. Last year was 11.6%. Is this basically kind of -- in the past, you've said that you kind of need 8% to 10% organic growth to maintain margins and maybe you're anticipating 7% to 8% organic growth here. Is that essentially the function, just some kind of cost creep that you need to achieve a certain kind of speed of top line growth to mitigate?","Timothy M. Manganello","Well, there's no question that if we're going sequentially and not having growth, the margins are going to be challenged. That's correct. But you also this third quarter effect as well dragging it down because that's typically a low-margin quarter. But you're right, as sequentially the growth rate is not there, the margin expansion is going to be more stressed.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. I was thinking more year-over-year. So looking at third and fourth last year to third and fourth this year and that seems to be happening. It seems you would agree that that's more a function of just the growth rate as opposed to something happening with respect to mix or pricing changes.","Timothy M. Manganello","Yes, yes, correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from Colin Langan with UBS.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can you just clarify your comments on corporate expenses? I think you said that stock comp would no longer be -- it was a factor in Q1 so that's why there's this big decline in that line item. And it actually should stay flat through the rest of the year, is that correct, so it should be around $21 million?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","What I would do is I would take the first half of the year maybe and take an average there on the corporate expenses running forward. I wouldn't just launch from the second quarter base. But back to your question, stock comp is not going to have the variation that we've seen historically. But I would kind of reset your numbers. I'd take maybe year-to-date average to go forward.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And not to keep honing on it, but you kind of gave your outlook for the second half of the year and your sales guidance. So what changed from the original guidance? Because you said Europe full year was the same. So is North America now weaker, is Japan now weaker than your original guidance had anticipated?","James R. Verrier","Yes. I think what I would say again is at a macro level, we see deteriorating economic conditions, particularly in the second half of the year. And as we were talking earlier, Europe is obviously the major driver for us. But it's other regions of the world as we outlined earlier. And also, commercial vehicle is a key driver there and then a little bit of a softening on some of the backlog as we also described earlier.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just last question, there is some news about in Europe some thermal investigations. I know you have some small components there. Any involvement in some of those investigations?","James R. Verrier","We are not involved at all as BorgWarner.","Operator","One final question from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.","Ryan Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Obviously, you just posted a very strong gross margin quarter. Several of your peers, though, have recently been citing greater automaker price-downs as pressuring margins. You were already asked about those pricing pressures today on the call. But perhaps you could update us on what actions you're taking on the cost side that are seemingly offsetting or more than offsetting the impact of these price-downs?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Yes. First, kind of, comment is from a price pressure point of view, that, for us, is always there. It's no different now to prior years and that's just part of our business. So we have not seen a fundamental shift in pricing pressure. It's always tough and it always will be. And what we do through productivity in our facilities and a lot of good cost control management, we go a long way to offsetting those price-downs. And I think that's what you've seen in prior years and prior quarters and it's what you've seen in this year. But that's a more, let me say, shorter-term tactical answer. I think on a more strategic or higher level perspective, which I think is absolutely critical, is our continued advanced technology and better technology enables us to have a stronger position in the marketplace as we go forward and offers us a competitive advantage, which continues to fuel our growth well above the market rates as we see. And that enables us to have a good position with our customer base. So it's a combination. To summarize, it's a combination of very, very good cost control and superior advanced technology that we bring to the market.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. Last question then. Can you update us a little bit about the current dynamics in the turbochargers space? I believe there are some relatively newer competitors that are trying to gain market share. I'm just curious how you feel your book of business is holding up in the face of that.","James R. Verrier","Our book, our business, our turbocharger business continues to be extremely strong and it's a big part of our growth. It's a big part of our backlog. We've said before we're roughly about 1\/3 of the market and we expect that to continue on. We do see, obviously, activity from the new entrants, which has been planned for a number of years. But we absolutely believe we have great technology and we absolutely have confidence that the turbocharger business will continue to grow and we don't anticipate any market share erosion in that segment and it will continue to be a huge part of our backlog.","Ken Lamb","I'd like to thank you all again for joining us.

We encourage you to follow along with these charts during our discussion of our results. ","With that, I'll turn it over to James. ","James Verrier","Thank you, Ken, and welcome to everybody, to the call. Ron and I are really pleased today to share our third quarter 2016 results with you as well as give you some thoughts and outlook for the rest of the year. ","I'd like to start, actually, by sharing a few thoughts on the macro environment in the industry in general, and you can see that on slide 2 if you're following along. So just a few thoughts on the macro state of the world. I think the word that we think about is still -- there's a level of uncertainty in the macro world. I think the slowing economic growth around the world is still on everybody's mind and that's presenting some challenges. You know, the world is still not without a lot of tenseness around some of the political climate. You think of the Middle East, you think of US election and those types of things, so there's still an environment of uncertainty. ","But with that said, you know, what we've seen in the auto space is things have been moving along pretty well as anticipated and as expected, particularly in the third quarter. If I turn a little more specifically to the outlook around the auto space, let me start with some comments around light vehicle 2016 calendar year. Generally, our view on the marketplace is well aligned with HIS, which is calling for approximately a 7% growth in China on light vehicle. We see about 2% growth in Europe and the US is somewhere in the 2% to 3% growth. And we, like HIS and I think many on this call, we certainly acknowledge that the US cycle is maturing and in a slower growth mode. ","If I reflect where we are on commercial vehicle, I think I would characterize the global commercial vehicle space as still challenged. We see North America and South America still down and challenged for sure. We do see a little bit of improvement this year running through Western Europe and China also. So while it's a mixed bag globally, overall this space is still challenged. ","I always like to start these calls and talk a little bit about areas of watch that we think are particularly relevant to BorgWarner. And I would point, for us, to three in particular. The North American mature cycle I referenced earlier, and how that's going to play out with inventory. Recently we saw Ford aligning its inventory to match sales with their production schedule reductions. I think from a BorgWarner perspective, we felt that was well contained within our guidance. But we're going to pay close attention of will there be further adjustments as we go through the fourth quarter. ","The second area of watch that we pay a little bit of attention to, for sure, is diesel penetration in Western Europe, or in Europe in general. And that's true this year. If we look at how 2016 is playing out versus 2015, we see about a 2 percentage point drop in diesel penetration in Europe. And we've talked about this for a long time, we've been watching this trend of a decline in diesel, and I think we're very well prepared as BorgWarner as we've been aligning our products closely around gasoline and hybrid technology. ","The third area we're paying close attention to is China. We're enjoying some strong growth in the third quarter, and we're going to look to see what happens with the incentives as that phases out towards the end of this year and how that plays into next year. All of that said, I would say two things so far have been going very much as planned for our guidance, and naturally we're excited to discuss our performance. ","So let me talk a little bit about one other aspect before I get into our detailed numbers and that's in the regulatory and technology trend area. We still see a very strong drive around fuel economy and emissions regulations and the pull for advanced propulsion technology is not changing. There is a very robust intensity around the pull for advanced propulsion technology. ","I would say within the last quarter, we've seen a notable acceleration in discussions on gas and hybrid and EV technology, and that is playing itself out. And as that transition to electrification continues, we remain very active here. Multiple customers working with us on electrification solutions, whether that be a 48-volt architecture, hybrid architecture and EVs. Not just long term, this is also for products in the here and now. ","At our recent investor day, we highlighted there that we had approximately 19 new customer awards in the hybrid and electric vehicle space and I can assure you that number continues to grow. Our quoted activity remains robust with multiple customers and multiple products. As normal, we will publicly announce additional new business awards in this category when we receive additional customer approvals. But I will say, again, I'm very pleased with our bookings. ","Our win rates remain strong and the diversification of our bookings is also exciting for us. Both regionally it's well balanced, customers it's well balanced and we're pleased with the booking rates across the combustion, hybrid and electric space. And last but certainly not least, we're also pleased with the profitability that we're booking that new business at. ","So let me give a little bit of color on the financials and, obviously, Ron will step through this in a lot more detail. So I start with the third quarter at a BorgWarner level, and the conclusion for me is I'm very pleased with our third quarter. We delivered growth towards the high end of our guidance range and solid operating performance with sales of $2.2 billion, that's up 6% when we exclude FX and Remy. I think that's pretty impressive when you look at the global light vehicle production, essentially it was flat around the world with the exception of China that was a strong growth market. ","Regionally it played out pretty much as expected from a BorgWarner point of view, which resulted in strong growth in China and North America and Korea, partially offset by Europe aftermarket and CV. We delivered $0.78 EPS excluding non-comparable items. And our operating margin at 12%, when we exclude Remy, that's 12.9%. Strong operating performance for us. ","If we break that down by segments, the engine business was at $1.36 billion, which grew just under 4%. Primary drivers there were turbo and variable cam timing. And from a drivetrain perspective, we were $866 million reported, that's up 48%. But when we exclude currency and Remy, we grew at an impressive 11.4% in the drivetrain segment. That was primarily driven by strong all-wheel drive sales in both North America and in Europe. ","Now turning to our outlook for the rest of 2016, you see we did narrow our guidance around the center of the previous range. Ron will give you more details there. I would also say as we've gone through this year we've talked to you about some major launches that BorgWarner has been actively involved with. That's the Pentastar, with FCA, Ford Scorpion, Ford Super Duty and the GM Duramax. All have launched, and in our view, all are on track. ","So the outlook for our Q4, as we step into Q4, I would articulate that our risks and opportunities are pretty well balanced. We see good strong growth in China and a slowing North America, but we think our risks and opportunities are balanced, and the punch line is we feel confident in our guidance of 3% to 5% organic growth for the quarter and continued strong operating performance. ","Just a couple of comments around growth highlights, and I'll start with Remy. Ron will talk a lot more about the detailed financial aspects of the light-duty aftermarket transaction that we recently announced. I think this is a really good deal from a BorgWarner perspective. The primary thing for me strategically is this really allows the team to focus on what I would describe as the core Remy business and combining that rotating electrical expertise with the BorgWarner product offering. So this is a good transaction that we're going forward with. ","I would characterize the integration going well. I think operationally and financially it's performing as expected albeit with sales coming in a little lighter, primarily driven by CV and aftermarket. We remain very positive about the strength of the technology, multiple customers are engaged with us in discussions about the combination products, particularly, again, around the motors and clutches for hybrid vehicles that we talked extensively about at our investor day. ","Also a comment about M&A. The M&A pipeline remains very strong for us, very active, considering things. And as I mentioned at investor day and on prior calls, power electronics is the big priority for us as a Company. ","So let me kind of summarize. I think, so far I would characterize it as been a very good year for us so far. We've delivered what we said we would do, and with my count, and this is four very strong quarters for us consecutively where we meet or beat both the top line and the bottom line. ","The business is operating very well and we're heavily focused on executing the short-term performance, but also securing the growth for us in the future. Key for me is I absolutely believe we have a winning strategy that's going to focus on delivering advanced propulsion technology for combustion, hybrid and electric vehicles that will deliver the mid- to high single-digit growth that we've committed to. Finally I remain upbeat and very positive about delivering our 2016 guidance. ","So with that let me turn the call over to Ron. Thank you. ","Ron Hundzinski","Thank you, James, and good day, everyone. Before I review the financial details, I'd like to provide you some of the highlights as I see them for the quarter. First, we saw good growth. Second, we delivered solid operating performance, and third, we continue to see improvement in CapEx spending and free cash flow generation. So now, as Ken mentioned, I will be referring to the supplement financial slide deck that is posted on our IR website. Please follow along. ","First I'd like to focus your attention on slide 3. Throughout the presentation I will highlight certain non-US GAAP measures to provide a clear picture of how the core business performed, and for comparisons with prior periods. Specifically, we will be excluding the impact of foreign currency, Remy and non-comparable items from certain US GAAP measures. When you hear me say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of foreign currencies, Remy and non-comparable items. When you hear me say on a reported basis, that means US GAAP. ","So let's turn to slide 4. On a reported basis, which includes the change in sales due to market growth, price, net new business and currency, and the Remy acquisition, sales were up 17.5%. On a comparable basis, our sales are up 6.1% toward the high end of our guidance range. On reported basis, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 21.3% in the quarter, but on a comparable basis, gross margin was 21.9% of sales, up 70 basis points from last year. ","On a reported basis, SG&A was 9.5% of sales. R&D spending, which is included in SG&A, was 4% of sales. On a comparable basis, SG&A was 9.1% of sales which is up 120 basis points from a year ago. There's three reasons for this increase. First, R&D spending on a comparable basis was up 40 basis points from a year ago as we continued to invest in the future. I would like to point out, it was still at 4% of sales. Second, as we discussed in our second quarter earnings call, we implemented sharp cost controls in the third quarter of 2015 in response to macro uncertainty making the year-over-year comparison challenging, so about 40 basis points of this increase was due to that rough comparison. The remaining 40 points is that increase is due to higher administrative costs in the Company. ","Now, let's take a look at the year-over-year comparison from operating income which can be found on slide 5. Starting on the right, third quarter 2016 operating income excluding non-comparable items, but including Remy, was $265 million or 12% of sales. If you also exclude Remy's $7 million of net contribution, operating income on a comparable basis was $259 million or 12.9% of sales, down 40 basis points from a year ago. On a comparable basis, operating income was up $8 million on $115 million of higher sales, that gives us an incremental margin of 7% in the quarter. ","This performance is below trend, but was expected due to the higher SG&A spending. From an operations perspective, or if you look at the segment levels, another way of saying it, incremental margins were up actually 14% in the quarter. As you look further down the income statement, equity and affiliate earnings was about $12 million in the quarter, up from $9 million last year. ","Interest expense and finance charges were $22 million in the quarter, up from $15 million a year ago. The increase is primarily due to the $500 million fixed rate senior notes that we issued in the third quarter of 2015. Provision for income taxes in the quarter, on a reported basis, was $49 million, however, this included a $31 million tax benefit related to our non-comparable item and other favorable tax adjustments. You can read about each of these adjustments in our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. Excluding these items, the provision for income taxes was $80 million for an effective tax rate of 31%, which is in line with our full-year guidance. Net earnings attributable to non-controlling interests were about $10 million, up $1 million from the third quarter of 2015. This line represents our minority partners' share in the earnings and performance of our Korean and Chinese joint ventures. ","So let's take a look at our diluted earnings per share on slide 6. Net earnings, excluding non-comparable items, but including Remy, were $0.78 per share. On a comparable basis net earnings were $0.76 per diluted share. ","Now let's take a closer look at our offering segments in the quarter beginning on slide 7 of the deck. Reported engine segment net sales were $1.36 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the engine segment on a comparable basis was 3.8%, primarily due to higher turbo charger and variable cam timing sales, partially offset by weak aftermarket and off-road commercial vehicle markets around the world. ","Turning to slide 8, reported EBIT was $218 million for the engine segment or 16.1% of sales, excluding currency, adjusted EBIT was 16% of sales, down 20 basis points from the prior year. On a comparable basis, the engine segment's adjusted EBIT was up $6 million on $50 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 12%. ","Now turning to slide 9 and starting from the right, drivetrain segment net sales were $866 million in the quarter. This includes $215 million of sales from Remy. Sales growth for the drive train segment on a comparable basis was 11.4%, primarily due to higher all-wheel drive sales. Strong growth for the drivetrain segment. ","On slide 10, reported EBIT was $87 million for the drivetrain segment or 10% of sales. Excluding Remy and currency, adjusted EBIT was 12.4% of sales which is up 40 basis points from the prior year. On a comparable basis, the drivetrain segment's adjusted EBIT was up $10 million on $67 million of sales for an incremental margin of 15%. ","Now let's take a look at the balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $593 million of net cash from operating activities in the first nine months of the year, and that's up $123 million from a year ago. Capital spending was $355 million for the first half, which is down $64 million from a year ago. As a percentage of sales, CapEx was 5.2% of sales in the first nine months. ","Free cash flow, which we define as net cash from operating activities less capital spending, was $238 million in the first nine months, up $187 million from a year ago. We are still on track to generate between $400 million and $475 million of free cash flow in 2016, at the midpoint, that's up 50% from 2015. ","Looking at the balance sheet itself, balance sheet debt increased by $65 million and cash decreased by $59 million in the first nine months compared with the end of 2015. The $124 million increase in net debt was primarily due to share repurchases. We spent $250 million repurchasing just under 7.3 million shares in the first nine months, already achieving our expected $200 million to $300 million of share repurchases this year. ","Our net debt to net capital ratio is 35.6% at the end of the quarter, up from 35.2% at the end of 2015. Net debt to EBITDA at the end of the quarter on a trailing 12-month basis was 1.4 times. ","Now, before we move on to guidance discussion, I'd like to review the sale of the Remy's light vehicle aftermarket business announced earlier this month. As James said, strategically the business was not core. While aftermarket is an important segment for us, this aftermarket business sells to big box retailers, which is a very different business model from our aftermarket business, which sells to wholesalers and distributors. ","The deal is a win-win for both the buyer and BorgWarner. The buyer has a strategic focus in this market segment. They will invest in this business and combined with this existing business gain a scale advantage. BorgWarner will retain the rotating electric components that complement our strategic focus on hybrid and electric vehicle propulsion systems. ","We sold the business for $80 million, which is a fair price. From an accounting perspective, we recorded a pretax loss of $106 million due to the revaluation of the business reflecting current market conditions. There are two additional favorable outcomes of the deal. First, it is accretive to margins. Year to date, Remy's margins have been just over 4%. Excluding the light vehicle market business, Remy's margins would have been 100 basis points higher. ","Second, due to the payment terms with its customers, that business factored the majority of its receivables, which is considered debt by the rating agencies. With the sale of that business, our debt as calculated by the rating agencies is reduced by $75 million. ","Now I'd like to discuss our current 2016 guidance. Returning to the slide deck, let's start with our sales growth guidance for the full year on slide 11. Note that the baseline for 2015 net sales excludes Remy, which was just under $7.9 billion. We have narrowed our sales guidance range around the center of the previous range. All in, we expect to grow between 15.2% and 16% this year compared to 13.7% and 17.5% previously. ","A few points on updated sales guidance. Our outlook for organic growth has improved. Market-related growth and new business growth net of pricing is now expected to be 4.3% to 4.8% compared with 3% to 5.5% previously and we expect the impact of currency to be less negative than it was before. However, these favorable items are offset by a weaker outlook for Remy sales, as James said earlier, primarily in the commercial vehicle and the aftermarket business. ","Net-net, the midpoint of the sales guidance range is unchanged, and I'd like to make one other point here. The assumption is that the Remy aftermarket remains at BorgWarner throughout the end of the year because of uncertainty of exactly when the closing date is going to be on the sale. ","Now let's take a look at our operating income guidance on slide 12. We are now expecting 13% to 14% incremental margins on our core business sales growth, which is slightly down from our previous guide of 15% to 17%. Incremental margins were about 14% through the first nine months of the year, and we expect our fourth quarter incremental margin to be in the low- to mid-teens as well. On a comparable basis, we still expect our operating income margin to be above 13%, and including Remy, our operating income margin is still expected to be greater than 12%. ","On slide 13 we have our EPS guidance. We expect earnings of $3.24 to $3.28 per share, including a $0.12 per share contribution from Remy, up from $3.16 to $3.32 previously. An improved outlook on the impact of currency and a lower share count are driving the change. ","Now let's review our fourth quarter guidance, which is simply the remainder of what's left in our annual guidance, starting with the sales growth on slide 14. All in, we expect to grow between 14.3% and 17.8% in the quarter, including between 10 to 12 percentage points from Remy and about one percentage point due to favorable currency. On a comparable basis, our organic growth is expected to be between 3% and 5% in the quarter. From an earnings perspective, as shown on slide 15, we expect earnings of between $0.82 and $0.86 per share in the fourth quarter, which includes about $0.02 per share from Remy. ","So in conclusion, we had a solid quarter. As James said, this is the fourth quarter in a row of exceeding our EPS and sales goals, and as we look at the remainder of the year, we expect to continue to be on this path. Solid sales growth, strong operating margins and improved cash flow from a year ago. ","So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ken. Thank you. ","Ken Lamb","Thanks, Ron. Now let's move to the Q&A portion of the call. Chris, could you please remind everyone of the Q&A procedures? ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Richard Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Richard Kwas","So a question -- so on the incremental margin on a core basis, so the 13% to 14%, is the target as we think about longer term in a stable production environment, is that still mid-teens, Ron?","Ron Hundzinski","I'd say it's still mid-teens, Rich, but the question is how you define mid-teens, is it 16, is it 14, 15? It's in that range, 14 to 16 is what I would say, all right?","Richard Kwas","Okay. And then just -- I know you're going to give the outlook for '17 in January, but last year when you updated the backlog, it appeared you took more sane view of the market and your outgrowth over the longer term, and so when we think about '17 and '18, and we think about now that we're 9, 10 months into the year and have a little bit of better view on how '17 may play out at least, anything that we should think about from a macro standpoint as it would potentially effect '17 and '18 for your backlog contribution?","James Verrier","Yes. Let me try to take a shot at that for you, Rich. So I think I would say, you know, maybe a couple of things that may be helpful. Let me say the discipline and the methodology and approach that we used for '16, we feel good about, and the reason we feel good about that is Ron and I both alluded to, we've been hitting our numbers pretty well with some fluctuations in the market.","We've seen noise in the market place, we've seen launch noise and macro noise and we've been executing really well in that mid-single-digit organic growth area or range. And so we'll be applying that same approach, that same methodology as we march towards '17 and '18. I would say a general level launch cadence, launch volumes has played out pretty much, you know, there's obviously puts and takes, so that gives me at least comfort that the methodology is solid, the business strategy is very solid, the win rates are very solid.","So we'll go through all of that mathematics, as you can imagine, in the fourth quarter as we get ready for January. But I would say at a high level, there's nothing fundamentally there that's different than where we were thinking a year ago, and I would just say you and we should take comfort in the way we've executed this year, both on the top line and the bottom line as we get ready for a net new business in January.","Richard Kwas","And then James, just one last quick one, thanks for that color, on China, what's kind of the going assumption at this point? Is it that come year end the government goes cold turkey with the subsidize or is there any expectation just internally as you're thinking about it, there may be some additional subsidy or some kind of incentive that continues into '17?","James Verrier","Yes. Our thought Rich right now is that it would continue, you're right, through the fourth quarter. And we're continuing to test and question and evaluate whether that will -- whether there will be any continuation of that into '17. It's a little early, we don't know. Our modeling would probably suggest that it will not continue on into '17, but things can move in that part of the world very quickly, as you well know.","But we're more in likely won't continue incentives into '17, but we're watching it closely, Rich, in case that moves","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Your line is open.","Brian Johnson","I have two questions, one kind of shorter term and one just revisiting some topics from your Investor Day. On the short to midterm, can you maybe give us a little color within the engine segment? I think a number of investors were braced for even slower growth there given the Ford production pressures and the European diesel shift mix, so can you give us -- as well softish commercial vehicle, can you give us a sense of some of the puts and takes within the drivers of engine revenue?","James Verrier","Yes. I can talk a little bit about that, Brian. So you're right, commercial vehicle is not helping. I mean, frankly, the puts and takes amongst commercial vehicle, but commercial vehicle is essentially no growth, so that's the one that impact on the engine business. I talked a little bit about diesel mix and so if you do it year-to-date comparable, Brian, from '15 to '16, Western Europe it's down a couple of percentage points, and I think we've been fairly consistent through the year that that's not -- that doesn't move the needle for us materially when it moves a percent or two down.","The question is you look at will that trend continue down, our view is it will and we feel we're well prepared there with the growth that we're delivering on gas turbos. In the quarter itself, the two big drivers for growth on engine were turbo and Variable Cam Timing, those were strong and I would say that was on a pretty global basis, so it wasn't one region particularly that stood out.","And, you know, relative to Ford, Brian, if we go back to the prior earnings call, I know there was a lot of concern on that day of Ford's lowering expectations or lowering projects, what are you going to do. We felt we had that pretty well contained in our guidance and we delivered and I think some of their recent announcements through the last few weeks, we would like to believe that we feel pretty comfortable, we've got that covered as well as we go into the fourth quarter.","So hopefully that gives you a little bit of color that's useful, Brian.","Brian Johnson","Yes. Now on the longer term, a number of investors have remarked, in fact, we have new power train forecasts that have EVs in China in particular as well as Europe well ahead of the IHS projections, Mary Barr [ph] said on the call yesterday said she expects China's EVs to be growing faster than -- be the sresgsion with the most deep penetration in the next decade. I guess a couple things. You know, one, you know, you did talk being neutral to those, but are you seeing any evidence in your quoting activity and any in China vis-\u00e0-vis EVs, are they going to skip the hybrid step and go right to EVs, and then kind of within that, as a non-Chinese player given a lot of the market in China tends to -- subsidies tend to favor the hometown players. How do you see kind of playing in the emerging new energy vehicle market in China?","James Verrier","I think if you go back a little bit to Investor Day, and I can maybe use that as a reference point, I would say nothing has materially changed since Investor Day which is not a surprise because that's only a few weeks out. I would say from a China perspective we'll see a combination, it will use hybrids and electrics. I don't think there will no hybrids in China. I think there will be a balance, but I would tend to agree with you that the intensity and the drive towards pure battery electric vehicle is probably strongest in China than any other region of the world.","That's not to say it's not going to get adopted in Europe and North America, but there is a strong push for pure electrics in China, and we've been announcing that we're benefiting from that. You know, a single space transmission technology is adopted on a number of those vehicles that are out there and we've got other products going on it, but directionally, I would agree, Brian, that it's the fastest area which is penetrating the most from a pure EV, but I would not say it's without any hybrids because I think there will be hybrids for sure in China.","Brian Johnson","Okay. And then in terms of your position, you know, is what you're saying maybe even if there's favoritism towards local battery suppliers or at least locally-made batteries, things like the transmission and other elements you might involve with are more of or at least a level playing field?","James Verrier","Yes. We may be just -- to that point, Brian, when we were articulating it at Investor Day, in simple numbers, the compound annual growth rate for pure electric vehicles globally from now through 2023 was in the mid-20% percent and BorgWarner in the 50s. So, yes, we're going to benefit from EV adoption in China and it will be transmission is today where we're shipping those today on electric vehicles, but I feel more management products will play there together with some of the other products we highlighted on Investor Day. So we feel good about the drive to pure electrics in China. It's helpful for BorgWarner, Brian.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris McNally of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Chris McNally","This is a follow-on to questions on pure electrification. Could you just maybe discuss how you balance the risks given that some of the targets [indiscernible] been thrown out by maybe some of the Germans which I think we all see as somewhat aggressive.","There's been a history in the industry of overestimating penetration for electrification, given consumer adoption has seemed to trail what regulators and some of the emissions would call them ideal.","It seems like you're taking a very gradual pace, but just how do we think about sort of the pace of investment if, let's say in 2020 some of these volumes are less than expected?","James Verrier","Yes. It's a very good thought, and I would refer us back to the conversations we had at Investor Day, and it goes something like this. BorgWarner has an extremely clear strategy around being the leader in propulsion, in advanced propulsion technology for combustion, for hybrids and electrics. And to your point, Chris, we know that those penetration rates of the different hybrid vehicles and the different electrics are going to move around.","Nobody has a crystal ball to know exactly what the penetration rate is on any of those platforms, what we're doing, and we will continue to do is position ourselves to offer product offering for all of those architectures and support the customers as needed and we're putting ourselves in a position with the portfolio that we have that if hybrids accelerate a little faster than electrics or electrics go a little faster than hybrids, we will be great because we're going to grow with any of them. We're going to grow on hybrid content, we're going to grow on electric and we're going to grow on combustion.","So I appreciate your point. I think there is some uncertainty out there, and that's what we're looking frankly speaking to take advantage of by offering a broader portfolio than anybody else, that we can participate and it will play out as it plays out. BorgWarner will continue to grow in that mid-to high single-digital growth rate independent of ships with the different propulsion architectures if that helps you.","Chris McNally","No, that's great. Is it fair to say from your initial comments about some of the conversations accelerating clearly over the last six months or a year, is that fair to say that\u2019s both in call it mild, hybrid, 48 volt as well as sort of higher voltage plug-in and EV that you\u2019re seeing accelerations in both categories?","James Verrier","Yes. It's a good thought. If I go back, maybe look at a six-month period, Chris to use your reference point, I would say generically the shift away from diesel is intensified and increased. We don't see it as a clip event, but I think it's fair to say the shift away from diesel has probably increased over the last six months. I think that the focus on 48 volt mild hybrid and plug-in hybrids is about the same. I think that's a strong trend and it's continued strong. And I think we've seen a stronger voice in Europe and China around pure electric vehicles, probably the move is if you wish over the last six months and again, we feel very good about that. Again, it reconfirms the fact that there will be these shifts and we're well positioned to take advantage as the shifts occur.","Operator","Your next question comes from your Emmanuel Rosner of CLSA. Your line is open.","Emmanuel Rosner","So I apologize I joined the call a little bit late, so maybe some of this color has been provided before, but so as we see these slightly faster shift away from diesel that you just described, in the near term, I understand in the mid-term obviously you\u2019ve a lot of [indiscernible] hybrids and electric vehicles, but I guess in the near term can you just remind me what sort of the content impact is between if it's an automaker replaces a diesel vehicle with a gas vehicle, what would be sort of that near term content impact?","James Verrier","So you're right. What I alluded to earlier, Emmanuel, I'm not sure if you were on the call. Our view of Europe, is if you look at a '15 year to date versus the '16 year to date, the diesel share or the diesel penetration is down about 2%. Our view is that, that will continue to creep down. We're not seeing a cliff-type event.","So we see that trending down. I think fundamentally what we are seeing is those -- so the question is really what are those diesel vehicles being replaced with. And I would say the vast majority in our view are those with turbocharge gasoline vehicles, so that obviously plays well for BorgWarner. We are not seeing a shift from diesel to naturally aspirated [ph] vehicles so much. We're seeing turbo charged gasoline and sometimes turbo charged gasoline hybrids, so near term it's pretty small impact for us, you know, obviously it affects a lot of -- some of our emissions products a little, but net-net for BorgWarner, Emmanuel, it's relatively small impact for us as it shifts from diesel to gas, particularly if it's at a gradually pace that we've seen thus far.","And just to reinforce I think your other point is we get to the mid-term, let's say three years plus out, then it's not an issue at all for BorgWarner. So small is kind of the conclusion, Emmanuel, if that helps you.","Emmanuel Rosner","That definitely helps. So I guess in this context where I guess the mix shift seems manageable, so if you're invested anywhere, essentially suggesting a mid to high single-digital organic growth rate going forward that would imply obviously a bit of acceleration versus your guidance for this year and sort of like 4% to 5% as you look to I guess we're entering 2017 do you feel comfortable about being able to get this acceleration in organic growth even with sort of like some of these small mix head wind?","James Verrier","I think a couple of points, Emmanuel I would point to. First of all, we feel very good about where we're at right now. You know, it's coming towards the end of October, we still will talk to you in January about our guidance and we're delivered on that. We're in four good quarters now. So we feel good that we're hitting our stride on executing that mid-single-digit growth organically which is excellent. I think one of the things that I would say is as we start to think about '17, '18 and '19, one of the things we articulated at Investor Day is I want people to think that we're going to operate in a band of mid- to high single-digital growth rate.","So that means that maybe a year or two where we're at high, there may be a year or two where we're at mid. It's not a linear upward curve or arrow if that makes sense to you Emmanuel. I don't want think people we\u2019re going to be running 3, 4 or 5 and then we got a 6 and then we got a 7, then we got an 8, then we got a 9, it's not that way. What we\u2019re saying is we\u2019re confident and comfortable in our strategy, in our portfolio and our technology that we will consistently able to deliver in a mid-to high single-digital band and external factors will move us a little bit in the band, Emmanuel, of that mid to high single-digital band. Does that help a little bit for you?","Emmanuel Rosner","Yes, absolutely but just to be -- you're not expecting a hockey stick within it, it's essentially any given year, should be in the mid to high single digits, am I right?","James Verrier","That's a good way to think of it, Emmanuel. Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy of Merrill Lynch.","Your line is open.","John Murphy","I apologize I got on the call a little bit late, so I've got a few questions that you may have talked about a little bit already. Just first on schedules here in the near term, particularly in North America, there appears to be some disparity strategies where some companies like Ford are cutting production pretty quickly, you try to adjust inventory down relative to demand and some companies are not.","I'm adjust curious what you guys are seeing as far as schedules and volatility and as you look, you know, on 30 and 60-day releases, are there significant changes that have been occurring or volatility that are tough to handle or is it really pretty consistent and they're giving you a good heads up and seem logical so far?","James Verrier","I would say in general, visibility is about the same as it typically kind of was, if you like, 45, 60 days. I think in general we've been getting good communications and good visibility from all of the OEMs here. We're not getting too much last minute kind of cuts and those types of things.","Obviously like you and everybody, we're going to pay a lot of attention to this because as you start to come towards the year-end, but I would say to use a phrase, you know, the discipline around scheduling and releasing has been pretty good. An example for us would be, when we had this exact same call last quarter that was at a time when Ford was kind of suggesting releases, reductions, etcetera and we talked about it then that we believed we had that well contained in our guidance and I think it's fair to say we delivered on that, so that's encouraging.","And I mentioned earlier in the call, John, I'm not sure if you were on, the latest news from Ford so to speak, we feel that's contained in our guidance which essentially was unchanged as we went into this quarter. So I think generally, John, it's reasonably well disciplined. We watch it and pay a lot of attention to it, but so far so good.","John Murphy","Then underlying the results, I mean Remy seems to be doing relatively well, maybe little bit ahead of expectations, is there anything that's changed there as you're getting deeper into it or is it really, running in line with your internal expectations?","James Verrier","Yes. I would say, John, generally it's running well. Overall it's running well. The top line has been a little softer through the year. We saw that, but that was pretty much end market driven on commercial vehicle and after markets, so that's just you know the macro driven. But on the OE side pretty much as we expected. I think from an operating point of view, John, it's been running well and I think I would say we're incrementally positive on our dialogue with the customers, particularly around, the combination of Remy's rotating electrics with mechanical know how around P2 hybrid modules that we talked about at Investor Day, I think that continues to go extremely well for us globally, by the way, Europe, Asia and North America. So overall really good","Ron gave a couple of comments earlier, John, if you weren't on, you know, it's a really good thing that we can completely this transaction on the light duty retail aftermarket business, that's just not core to us and I think that will allow us to focus more on the core, so I think that's another incremental step forward with Remy. As Ron alluded to, that helps the margin profile as well of the business. So, yes, it's going well, John. You know, a lot of work ahead of us, but it's going well.","John Murphy","Okay. And then just lastly, as we think about cap allocation run, I mean, there's a growing concern that we're getting closer to peak and given how strong items [ph] are, it's hard to argue that, we might have some more upside, but we're getting close, and there's a lot of concern about what the down side could mean here in North America or in Europe with the Brexit risk or China ultimately slowing down.","With all of those kinds of, sort of potentially choppy environments that may or may not occur, but thinking about them, would you consider maybe getting a little bit more conservative on capital allocation, meaning maybe building up a little bit larger of a cash cushion to take advantage of whatever opportunities might, you know, prevail themselves as the cycle ultimately does turn?","James Verrier","So, John, you're correct, I can tell you that internally over probably the last four months or so we've had discussions about liquidity. I'll use the term liquidity, right, because that's what it comes down to at the end of the day and how you preserve liquidity through a cycle and how much liquidity do you need going through a cycle and so I think you're absolutely correct. I know inside BorgWarner we are looking at the liquidity numbers and making sure that we're very liquid through a cycle. So, yes, you're correct, we are looking at this.","John Murphy","Okay. But would you favor potentially building that up pretty significantly relative to buybacks now so that you could potentially take care of more advantageous opportunities over time? I'm just trying to gauge how you're going to allocate capital here in the near term, ultimately rather than the longer term.","James Verrier","Yes, I know what you're getting at, John. So let's refresh ourselves here. We are about 2\/3 into the $1 billion buyback program, correct? And I think it's safe to say that we're going to give a lot more color here in January as far as what we're thinking, and I think you're right, in the context, I would say that we are considering maybe a more conservative posture, but we have to weigh that against other items, maybe M&A activity potentially and also the peak cycle that we're in, and there's a couple other factors we have to look at as well, so I would say, though in general we're probably more bias to the conservative side right now, but we'll give more color in January.","Operator","Your next question is from David Leiker of Baird. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Joe [indiscernible] for David. I don't want to steal your thunder giving the '17 updates, but if I use those backlog numbers you provided last January, it would kind of foot to a number that would be closer to 3% after price, and so I just want to make sure your comments on targeting mid to high, is that something that returns talking about revenue growth that returns as soon as '17 and does that imply that maybe the backlog numbers are trending a bit better than what you provided at the beginning of the year?","James Verrier","This is James. Ron can weigh in after me. You're right, we're going to do it in January, so we got a little bit of time here, and we're going to work our way through it. The way I view it strategically, Joe, is we talked a lot at Investor Day that with our propulsion technology, we're comfortable that we're going to be a mid-to high single-digital growth company on an organic basis and we reminded everybody I think at the Investor Day it will fluctuate in that band of mid to high single-digit growth.","I would say there's been nothing materially or substantially that's changed for us to change that view. So what that all translates in exact dollars and percentages of organic growth for '17 and '18, Joe, we've got a few more weeks of work to get to that point, but we're comfortable in this mid to high single-digit organic growth for the future.","Ron Hundzinski","I'm going to add just a little bit color in the numbers, Joe. I believe the mid-point of the back of 2017 was $500 million of sales. I don't know what your starting point is, but I get quite a bit higher number than the one you just gave us on the call when I did the quick math here. I was not as low as you were, so you may want to fine tune your number crunching here a little bit. You should get a higher number.","Maybe, Ken and you can talk about that later, all right?","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then one more, if I shift back to '16, it would seem like the contribution from new business has to be stronger than those original numbers for just talking this year because you have customers that probably haven't produced what the plan said they would at the beginning of the year of highway markets have been weak.","Is that fair? And if it is, can you maybe provide some color on what's tracked better within the new business backlog this year?","James Verrier","I would say, Joe, you're right, the net new business for '16 has run a little better than what we'd expected, and I think you summarized it pretty well. You know we didn\u2019t remember, we didn't factor much in at all for commercial vehicle, so we weren't expecting much, and guess what we didn't get much.","You know, if you look at it regionally we've run pretty strongly in North America and Korea has been pretty good and China has been pretty good. So I wouldn't say it's one product or region, but intuitively, you're right, we're running a little better on the net new business for '16 and what we guided to at the beginning of the year.","Operator","We have one last question, and that question comes from Joseph Spak of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joseph Spak","Guys, maybe just to elaborate on that last point, so, again you don't sort of provide the backlog today, but if you could sort of back into at least directionally where it's trending and it does seem like it's coming in better. So I was wondering if you could maybe high level sort of critique your own sort of internal approach you've taken towards given the forecasting and whether that should give us confidence in some of the prior or the outer year backlog numbers you gave earlier this year?","James Verrier","I think the way I look at it is from my perspective, Joe, you know, we rolled out what our methodology and discipline was as we went into the year, and you recall, right, we took a more prudent approach to the launches in terms of both the volumes and sales in the cadence of the launch and then we also made the judgment to be a little bit more -- apply a little bit more of a macro factor to the number, our view and where our little bias, Joe, is we think that was a smart call because I think as we have gone through the year we have been consistently hitting our numbers in that just around that mid-single-digit growth rate.","That would imply, and I think you're right, the backlog is running a little better than we'd anticipated which is good, and I said earlier on the call, Joe, that we'll be utilizing that same discipline and methodology as we go into '17, and I think if we look at what the three of you of the backlog that we went into this year was, you know, in that mid-single-digit growth. I think 4 to 6 was the range for the three-year period, and we're executing in that range this year, so it gives us comfort as we go into the process for '17, '18, '19.","So we got some work to do, Joe, on the detail, but I gain comfort from our strong execution this year in delivering the growth that we set out to do. It helps me get comfort and help you get comfort as we go into the years.","Ron Hundzinski","Let me give you some numbers. I believe that in January we gave mid-point guidance of about $315 million of backlog and I think the current guidance is around 355, 360, so we are performing better than we indicated in January, that's nearly a year ago, so we're some $40 million - $50 million higher in numbers.","Joseph Spak","Right, despite a number of adversity and headwinds.","Ron Hundzinski","Yes, despite a lot of puts and takes as James was saying. At the end of the day we still performed better than we anticipated in January.","Joseph Spak","Okay. A last quick one, there was a report earlier this month which indicated that some automakers, and this gets back to sort of engine shifts in Europe, that they may have to meet real-world emissions scraps smaller engines and upsize engines to help meet those standards.","And I always thought that your content generally moves with the size of the engine, so, A, is that true, is that a potential benefit for you, and, B, have you seen any of the future sourcing actually revert back to some larger engines?","James Verrier","That's a good thought, Joe. I'll give you a couple of thoughts. The term that we're hearing a lot is right sizing which is a good way to think of it. So it's right sizing the engines. What I would say is it's not dramatic shift, so it's not like they're taking one liter engine and replacing it with a 2.5 liter engine. So it's subtle shifts they make out from 1.6 to 2 or a 1.8 to a 2 so we\u2019re seeing that. We\u2019re seeing that adjustment is a good word for me, and what we see is fundamentally the technology on the engine is very similar.","So if it's a turbo charged direct injection engine with Variable Cam Timing they are shifting that from maybe a 1.6 to 1.8 or a 2 and that's helping us. Generally speaking, your observation is a good one, Joe, the larger engines are generally slightly beneficial for BorgWarner, so this is a net-net a good move for BorgWarner, it's a helpful for BorgWarner, I'll put it that way.","James Verrier","So I'd like to thank you all again for joining us. We expect to file our 10-K before the end of the day which will provide details of our results. If you have any follow-up questions about our earnings release, the matters discussed during this call or our 10-Q, please direct them to me.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Nolan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Nolan, you may begin your conference.","Patrick Nolan","Thank you, Sharon, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We issued our earnings release at 6:30 AM Eastern Time posted on our website borgwarner.com on our homepage and on our Investor Relations homepage. A replay of today's call will be available through November 14. The dial-in number for that call is 855-859-2056. The conference ID for that replay is 2638875, or you can listen to the replay on our website.","With regard to our Investor Relations calendar, we will be attending multiple conferences between now and our next earnings release. Please see the Events section of our Investor Relations homepage for a full list.","Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements, which involves risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today. During today's presentation, we will highlight certain non-GAAP measures in order to provide a clearer picture of how the core business performed and for comparison purposes with prior periods. When you hear us say, on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of FX, net M&A and other non-comparable items. When you hear us say adjusted, that means excluding non-comparable items. When you hear us say, organic, that means excluding the impact of FX and net M&A.","We will also refer to our growth compared to our markets. When you hear us say, market, that means the change in light vehicle production weighted for our geographic exposure. Our outgrowth is defined as our organic revenue change versus the market.","But now back to today's call. First, Fred Lissalde, our President and CEO, will comment on our Q3 results. This will be followed by a discussion of our recent cash flow performance. He will conclude with a discussion of our recent product highlights. Then Kevin Nowlan, our CFO, will discuss the industry outlook as well as the details of results and guidance. Please note, that we have posted an earnings call presentation to the IR page of our website. We encourage you to follow along with these slides during our discussion.","With that, I'll turn it over to Fred.","Fred Lissalde","Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased to share our results from Q3 today and also provide an overall company update. Let me start with the highlights of the quarter on slide 4. I am pleased with our stronger than expected top line and margin performance in the quarter. With approximately $2.5 billion in sales, we were up about 4.5% organically. This compares to a market being down approximately 0.4%. So our outgrowth was about 490 basis points in the quarter, which was well ahead of our expectation, driven by stronger than expected revenue trends in Europe, essentially, and in China.","Regionally, we saw outgrowth in all major regions. On an organic basis, our European light vehicle revenue was up double-digits. Our North American and Chinese light vehicle revenue was up mid-single digits year-over-year. Our adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.96, ahead of our guidance, driven by the revenue upside and better than expected margins.","Our near-term cost actions are beginning to drive our incremental margins, and we are identifying additional cost saving opportunities to sustain our strong margin profile. At the same time, we are also securing key new wins across combustion, hybrid and electric, which is positioning us to deliver continued revenue outgrowth. In fact, in this quarter, we secured awards for two new products for electric vehicles, which I'll speak about in more detail shortly.","Next, I would like to highlight our strong cash generation on slide 5. As you know, cash flow has become an important focus for the company over the last couple of years. Year-to-date we have generated $478 million of free cash flow, up significantly year-over-year despite the volatile industry volume. We're able to drive this level of free cash flow thanks to our strong margin and earnings profile.","Combining this with, our increased focus on capital spending efficiency and working capital management we remain poised to continue to improve our free cash flow generation going forward. A strong cash generation allows us to reinvest in the business to support our continued revenue outgrowth initiatives. It also gives us an ability to provide real cash returns to our shareholders.","We've been relatively balanced in how we've deployed this capital over time. As you can see, over the past five years, we've utilized about half of our free cash flow for strategic growth opportunities while deploying the other half towards returns of capital to shareholders. We expect to maintain a balanced approach to capital deployment as we look ahead.","In a few minutes, Kevin will talk about our strategic deployment of capital that we just executed this week, which allows us to eliminate our exposure to asbestos. Beyond our track record of capital deployment, our prudent leverage profile combined with strong cash generation better positions us to manage the business throughout the demand cycle.","At the same time, as we manage through the challenging global market environment, we continue to focus on pursuing new business and new technologies. This quarter, we achieved continued success on both fronts bookings and new technologies.","For combustion products, on slide 6, I want to highlight two contracts. First, we're supplying our turbocharges to a global OEM for its gasoline engines in multiple markets including North America. This program will start with two vehicles and expand to additional applications over the life of the program.","And second, we're supplying our gasoline EGR technology to Indian OEM for its small gasoline engines. This is an expansion of our existing business with this customer. Both of these wins point to the increased penetration of highly efficient gasoline engines around the world.","There are also great examples of applying already proven solutions towards meeting demands of OEMs. This allows us to reduce time to market, reduce cost to our customers while sustaining our product leadership in combustion propulsion.","Now, let's turn to slide 7 and discuss our first awards for two new electric vehicle products. First, our Torque-Vectoring Dual-Clutch for electric vehicles. This Dual-Clutch design replaces the conventional differential in an electric driveline while improving handling and maneuverability in an all-wheel drive application.","This clutch distributes torque independently to the left and right wheels from its position on the rear axle. The technology features disconnect capabilities to minimize energy loss and increase range.","This is a great example of applying our existing clutch and hydraulic controls expertise to electric vehicle platforms. This first award is supplying a major global OEM with start of production expected in 2022.","Next, I'm glad to announce that we have secured our first contract for our integrated drive module, so-called iDM. This product integrates our highly efficient power electronics with our advanced transmission system and our drive motor technology.","Our iDM creates value to our customers in several fields, including packaging, efficiency, low NVH, and of course, ease of assembly. We're supplying a China EV brand for an electric vehicle which is scheduled to go into mass production in 2021.","Importantly all components used in this iDM are part of BorgWarner's owned technologies. We have ongoing interest from several customers and are currently pursuing multiple program awards for our iDM.","Our differentiation in electric propulsion is our full propulsion system expertise. Many of our competitors purchase some of their components and subsystems. In our case, we design and manufacture the motor, the transmission, and the power electronics, creating system value for our customers. This first iDM award is a significant step for BorgWarner.","So, let me summarize the quarter. We exceeded our expectation for revenue growth. Earnings were better than our guidance, driven by better topline performance and our cost saving measures. We delivered strong free cash flow and the benefits of R&D investments in electric propulsion are continuing to pay off with the award of our first iDM contracts.","Before I turn it over to Kevin, I also want to commend and thank the entire BorgWarner team for how they have reacted to the challenging external environment. It is your actions, smartness, and dedication that allows the company to successfully manage the presence, while continuing to position us for future success.","Now, over to you Kevin.","Kevin Nowlan","Thank you, Fred and good morning everyone. Before I review the financials in detail, I'd like to provide a quick overview of the two key drivers of our third quarter results. First, our revenue outgrowth was ahead of our expectations at 490 basis points in the quarter. This was driven primarily by higher volumes of new programs and strong mix, especially in Europe. This puts us on track to deliver full year revenue outgrowth of 350 to 400 basis points. Second, our margin performance was ahead of guidance driven by better-than-expected sales and our focus on cost management actions.","Let's turn to slide 8, where you can see our perspective on industry production. Overall, while production expectations continue to moderate in the quarter, the volatility of these forecasts has declined over the past few months. This is a welcome change.","Looking specifically at Q3 global production for our market declined by 0.4% year-over-year roughly at the midpoint of our expectations going into the quarter. Within that global result, we saw European production up less than 1% against a relatively easy prior year comparison. North America production was down modestly while China production was down about 5% as that market remains under pressure.","On a full year basis we now expect the market decline to be in the minus 4% to 4.5% range which is roughly in line with our prior outlook. By region, we're now planning for China to be down anywhere from 9% to 11% on a full year basis which is a modest improvement from a few months ago. Europe is likely to be down 3.5% to 4% just as we previously expected. And North America is now likely to be down 2.5% to 3.5% which is a little bit worse than before.","As we look toward the remainder of 2019 and into 2020, we expect that the challenging industry conditions will continue so we are managing our cost structure accordingly.","Let's turn to slide 9. As we look at year-over-year revenue, you can see the impact from the thermostat divestiture we executed earlier this year. In addition, you can see that the stronger U.S. dollar reduced revenue by about 2.7% from a year ago.","Excluding these items, our organic sales were up 4.5% despite the 0.4% decline in industry production. This is the 490 basis points of market outgrowth. And importantly, this outgrowth occurred in all of the major light vehicle markets around the globe.","In Europe our light vehicle organic revenue was up double digits on strong new programs and platform mix. And in China we grew double digits over the market. Partially offsetting the strength in our light vehicle growth our commercial vehicle and off-highway businesses declined relative to last year, resulting in a more than 100 basis point drag on our total organic growth. Overall, we're pleased that we continue to deliver revenue outgrowth even in this challenging end-market environment.","Now, let's look at our adjusted operating income performance, which can be found on slide 10. Q3 adjusted operating income was $294 million, compared to $293 million in the third quarter of 2018. Our adjusted operating margin was 11.8%, which was flat year-over-year. On a comparable basis, adjusted operating income increased $9 million on $109 million of higher sales, which translates to an incremental margin of roughly 8%. Even though this was below our long-term expected incremental conversion of 15%, the result was still ahead of our guidance, due to stronger revenue and our cost management actions, which included a reduction in R&D spending in our engine segment compared to the same quarter in 2018.","Adjusted earnings per share, was $0.96 for the quarter above the top end of our guidance range. The $0.04 decline in earnings per share compared to the third quarter of 2018 was driven by lower equity and affiliates earnings and a slightly higher tax rate.","Moving to cash flow. As Fred discussed earlier, we are proud of the fact, we delivered a strong result for the quarter. In the third quarter, we generated $255 million of free cash flow, significantly stronger than the $126 million we delivered in the same quarter a year ago. This is a great result as we continue to focus on cash generation as a management team.","Now, let's take a closer look at our segment results on slide 11. Engine segment sales were just over $1.5 billion in the quarter. Organic sales for the Engine segment increased 4.6% or $69 million despite lower industry-wide production. Growth in Europe for our Engine business was partially offset by the impact of the weaker China end market.","Adjusted EBIT was $241 million for the Engine segment or 15.9% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Engine segment's adjusted EBIT was up $8 million on $69 million of higher sales. Drivetrain segment sales were $993 million in the quarter. On a comparable basis, sales for the Drivetrain segment increased 4.2% year-over-year, also meaningfully outperforming the market, driven by strong outgrowth in China and European mix.","Adjusted EBIT was $100 million for Drivetrain or 10.1% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Drivetrain segment's adjusted EBIT was down $5 million on $41 million of higher sales. The adjusted EBIT decline was driven by higher R&D spending and launch-related costs, primarily in China.","Now, I'd like to discuss our full year guidance, which is on slide 12. Our guidance is based on the end market assumptions I discussed earlier, with global production down 4% to 4.5%. Despite that, we expect organic revenue to be in the range of down only 1% to roughly flat. That's because we continue to expect to drive significant market outgrowth of 350 to 400 basis points for the full year. This is in line with our year-to-date outgrowth of approximately 400 basis points.","With these organic growth assumptions, we now expect total revenue to be in the range of $9.95 billion to $10.1 billion. The midpoint of this guidance is slightly lower than the midpoint of our prior guidance, as there is an additional $105 million of FX headwinds that are offsetting the benefit of stronger organic growth. Our adjusted operating margin is now expected to be in the range of 11.7% to 12.0%. The 20 to 30 basis point increase in our margin outlook relative to our prior guidance reflects stronger organic growth, which has a higher incremental margin than the margin impact of the additional FX headwinds and cost management actions including lower full year R&D relative to our prior planning assumption.","We continue to proactively manage and aligned our overall cost structure to the revenue we're actually seeing in the marketplace, while ensuring we continue to support the investments that drive our sustained revenue outgrowth. For full year adjusted EPS, we've tightened our guidance by increasing the bottom end of our range by $0.10 as a result of our stronger margin outlook. Therefore our new guidance range is $3.85 to $4 per diluted share.","And finally, we are now targeting free cash flow of $550 million to $600 million which is up $25 million from our prior guidance. In addition to higher earnings at the midpoint of our guide, we expect capital spending to come in lower than our prior guidance. That's our 2019 outlook.","Before we move to Q&A, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing an important transaction you saw us announce yesterday which is summarized on slide 13. On Wednesday, we signed and closed on a transaction in which we effectively sold the company's asbestos liabilities to a subsidiary of Enstar which is a publicly traded insurance company that specializes in managing runoff liability exposures like asbestos.","The transaction involved BorgWarner investing $172 million in cash into the non-operating legal entity that holds the asbestos liabilities. Then we transferred this entity including the cash and other related insurance assets to the buyer. The result of this transaction is that, we expect to remove the $772 million in asbestos liabilities from our balance sheet.","By eliminating the company's exposure to this liability, we will also avoid future exposure to the annual defense and indemnity cash costs which have been running in the $45 million to $60 million range as you can see on the slide. We think this was an important strategic deployment of capital that will eliminate the overhang of asbestos liabilities on our balance sheet and our cash flow.","Overall, we had a really solid quarter as we delivered 11.8% adjusted operating margin, 490 basis points of market outgrowth, $0.96 of adjusted EPS which was above our guidance range and $255 million of free cash flow. On top of that we executed a very important derisking transaction this week.","As a management team, we are taking the necessary actions to maintain our company's historically strong margin profile and strengthen our free cash flow generation. We'll continue to do this while managing through a very difficult near-term market environment that we expect will continue for the remainder of 2019 and likely into 2020.","With that I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat.","Patrick Nolan","Thank you, Kevin. Sharon we're ready to open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph Spak","Thanks all and good morning. I guess I just first wanted to focus on the backlog that you're indicating for this year. It's within your -- the range you talked about at the beginning of the year, but it does look like it was raised 15% at the midpoint versus what you indicated last quarter. So -- and I apologize if I missed this, but did something come back? Or did something pull forward? Or what was the cause of that revision?","Fred Lissalde","Joe, the major driver is actually from the engine group, better-than-expected new program launch and associated volume on small gasoline in Europe. That's the main driver.","Joseph Spak","Okay. So you took that down last quarter and then the volumes were just stronger than you thought as this quarter progressed?","Fred Lissalde","Yes. Yes it was difficult to forecast with the volatility of the market and it turned out to be better than expected.","Joseph Spak","Okay. And then just on the iDM market, it's nice to see a win there. Can you talk a little bit about how -- now that you're sort of bidding on those awards, how you see that market evolving? It\u2019s having all the subcomponents a true differentiating feature in winning that award and as you go after additional business?","Fred Lissalde","Yes, we think it is a true differentiating features because by -- not only developing and buying, but also manufacturing the three key elements of that iDM, we're able to design it smarter and make it smarter and make it lighter. And in those systems this is the interaction of those subsystems that make the product creating value in different shapes or form for our customers. So we think that it is going to be a differentiating factor and it has been for this business win.","Joseph Spak","And in the quoting are you seeing any shift towards more of an integrated product versus more of in a way a sourced-by-component strategy?","Fred Lissalde","This one was a system. We also as you know are in production with what we call eDM which is transmission end motor. We're not forced to sell our system. We're happy to sell systems or subcomponents. What's important in this market is to understand the system in order to partner with our customers and sell them whatever they want. And we are in this position.","Joseph Spak","Okay. Thank you. ","Fred Lissalde","Thanks, Joe.","Operator","Next question comes from with Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer.","Noah Kaye","Thanks. Good morning. So high-level question first. We're a few months away from the start of the implementation in Europe the more stringent CO2 standards. I guess, just based on your conversation with the customers what you've got in the pipeline as the process plays out over the next few years how does this impact BorgWarner in terms of content per vehicle growth backlog other dynamics?","Fred Lissalde","So Europe, first of all, the second half of this year is stabilizing and it's a good thing. It's true that it's comparing to a rather weak second half of 2018. And we see no signs of WLTP disruption. Now as far as next year is concerned for RDE, I would say that it's difficult to forecast and we will give you our look in our Q4 call.","The good news for us is that these standards in Europe will drive opportunity for our components and systems. So we see that as a plus. How this -- what will be the disturbance in 2020 due to the RDE validation remains to be seen. And again Noah, we'll give you some more color in our Q4 call.","Noah Kaye","Okay. I appreciate that. I think you commented on the key points of having an integrated solution with the iDM just knowing all the components there. So I want to ask about integration on, sort of, a similar product which would be electric turbochargers. I think one of your competitors recently stated they're introducing an E-turbo where the motor is integrated on the shaft of the turbo unit.","Clearly, you've got in-house competencies around both turbos and electric motors. So engineering and integrated unit would seem feasible, I guess just -- is that in your product road map? Is it something your customers are asking for? And more generally how do you see your competitive positioning with respect to electrically boosted turbos?","Fred Lissalde","Yes. So we are in production with E-boosters since quite some time with Daimler and others. And it is pretty much also motor around the turbo and our own power electronics. It's also a system that requires understanding of turbo motor and power electronics. So we have that in our portfolio. That's the E-booster. We also have E-turbo in our portfolio. And we think that this market will see some daylight in the next years to come. We are -- we believe is that electrification of turbocharges will drive growth for us.","Noah Kaye","Okay. Very helpful. I will jump back in queue. Thanks.","Fred Lissalde","Thanks, Noah.","Operator","Next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.","Ryan Brinkman","Hi. Great. Thanks for taking my question. You know, maybe just first can you talk about what you think the impact of customer consolidation is on the supply base around BorgWarner? Are there any market share or pricing implications for investors to consider?","Fred Lissalde","Are you -- well, overall we're very global and we serve all markets around the world. There is not one customer\u2019s that we don't serve. And to the extent that they use the same propulsion and they want to combine forces I think there are costs and benefits to both us and them. So we focus on what we can control and what we can control is carry on delivering great products that deliver value to any customers around the world.","Ryan Brinkman","Okay, great. Thanks. And can you please remind us of your latest exposure to commercial vehicles and your outlook for this market. Some of the other suppliers reporting this quarter have called out softer production of off-the-road vehicles where I think yours \u2013 you're primarily commercial on-highway. That tracked better, but there's a lot of changing estimates for next year. Just curious how you're thinking about that?","Fred Lissalde","Yeah. Commercial vehicle overall is about 13%, 14% of our revenue. And it's very, very I would say fragmented around the three continents about a third in North America, a third in Europe, and the last third between China and Brazil. It's also very fragmented as far as Class 8 is concerned in off-highway and agricultural construction. And its true CV was down this quarter especially the Class 8. And we'll give you our view of 2020 in the Q4 call. But again, when you think about 14% or 13% of revenue for CV for BorgWarner don't associate that to U.S. Class 8. It's much more than that.","Ryan Brinkman","Very helpful. Thank you.","Fred Lissalde","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank.","Emmanuel Rosner","Good morning. First some clarification on the backlog, if there's anything you can give in terms of incremental color. So, I guess last quarter, you were sort of like taking your expectations down for this year's backlog. In particular, you were making a fairly bold forecast or assumption of essentially no backlog in the third quarter. Obviously, extremely pleased with your performance this quarter $153 million, but it sort of feels like just incrementally higher volumes wouldn't sort of like explain going from like 0 to like $150 million. So anything else you can give us in terms of dynamics of why you maybe felt somewhat less positive? And what actually sort of is playing out in the quarter that turned out to be a really, really strong backlog?","Fed Lissalde","Yeah. So the last quarter guide from a backlog perspective, we actually thought that the China backlog was going to be down. And we saw that Q3 was modestly stronger than expected. But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the majority of the backlog is better-than-expected engine products related to small gasoline European platforms. And it was also a little bit of mix in Europe too. And that was not forecasted right? It's a good surprise that we take. We have enjoyed that our growth and also converted very well on it.","Emmanuel Rosner","Understood. And are you able to talk about implications from I guess the backlog now for this year trending towards the high end of the range communicated all the way back in January despite some fairly meaningful weakening in I guess production environment. What are the implications for that in terms of your existing three-year backlog? Are the puts and takes still the same where the volumes are maybe weaker than its back in January but at the same time potentially faster rollout of some of these launches or better volume on some of these new products? Or is it too early to tell?","Kevin Nowlan","Yeah, I think it's \u2013 I mean, I think overall what I would tell you is as we look ahead obviously, the markets are looking a lot different than they were maybe a year ago at this time. And undoubtedly, that will have implications on the business. We'll give more updates on our longer-term outlook when we get into our Analyst Day in the spring upcoming. But at this point, we're not prepared to give guidance on that in terms of a long-range outlook. But I would say obviously market is \u2013 has changed from where we were a year ago in terms of our outlook.","Emmanuel Rosner","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Armintas Sinkevicius with Morgan Stanley.","Armintas Sinkevicius","Great. Thank you for taking the question. I was hoping you could \u2013 as we look ahead here and think about some of the puts and takes for margins into 2020 obviously a lot of it's driven by global production the environment in China the backlog in China, the emission standards in Europe. But something within your control is the cost management, which you've done a good job on, but trying to think through how you plan to attack cost of goods sold and manufacturing?","Kevin Nowlan","Yes, I think -- I mean a focus point of ours as I've talked about in my remarks is sustaining our strong margin profile. And obviously we -- as we indicated on the call, we expect that the markets are going to remain under pressure and challenged as we look ahead to 2020. So our continued focus on managing cost performance is going to be a key element of how we think about 2020. So when we give guidance in February, you can expect it to reflect that we expect the market to be under pressure and we're going to look at cost actions that are appropriate to take to make sure we sustain the margin profile we have.","Armintas Sinkevicius","Okay. And then with regards to the asbestos transaction, can you remind me how the accounting works for the cash cost? Does it flow through the income statement? Or is it a cash flow item?","Kevin Nowlan","It's a cash flow -- the entirety of the liability has been accrued on the balance sheet. And so what happens is when we have cash costs, it simply relieves the liability. So it's not P&L. It's purely cash. But it's obviously real cash going out of our pockets $45 million to $60 million every year.","Armintas Sinkevicius","Okay. Much appreciated.","Operator","Next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America.","John Murphy","Good morning guys. Just sort of in light of the divestiture of the thermostat business and what you're doing with the asbestos liability, it seems like you're a little bit more open to at least small portfolio actions and sort of a little bit of restructuring here. Given the balance sheet is pretty underlevered at 0.7 times at least relative to other folks in the industry, I'm just curious how open you are or how active you are in portfolio -- in your portfolio review and potentially adding maybe some acquisitions? Given the stress that we might see there might be some really good stuff that opens up in the next year or two. I mean, how are you thinking about that? And how far could you go on leverage?","Fred Lissalde","Yes. We're managing our portfolio actively and we will do that going forward. From an M&A perspective, what drives our approach is the drive for technology in two elements: First would be scale and competencies in electronics; and secondly system focus and electric propulsion. So we do that very disciplined and it is a focus of us and we just carry on doing that.","John Murphy","So Fred, it's fair to characterize that as small acquisitions that would be focused on the EV powertrain is really where you're headed. Nothing that would be big bang, nothing that would be in \"sort of old school combustion technology.\" Is that a fair statement?","Fred Lissalde","Again, we'll be opportunistic and -- but also very disciplined on how we see that. The drive will be technology. That's the punch line.","John Murphy","Okay. And then just a clarification on the sale of the asbestos liability, it's being called Morse TEC. Is there anything going on with the chain business that's being sold? Or is that all residing? Is this just a way that this has been structured under the name Morse TEC just a little confusion.","Kevin Nowlan","They unfortunately happen to share the name Morse, but the Morse TEC entity that was transferred to Enstar has -- is a non-operating subsidiary of the company. So there is no portion of the operating business including the chain business that was transferred as part of this. It's still absolutely an important part of BorgWarner going forward.","John Murphy","\u2026.the liability and the assets going over?","Kevin Nowlan","That's called Morse Systems. It's the liability that happened to reside in a legal entity that had the name Morse TEC LLC. That's what's been transferred to Enstar. Non-operating, it really has the asbestos liabilities some environmental liabilities and then the cash and the insurance-related assets.","John Murphy","That's very helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We have a question from David Kelley with Jefferies.","David Kelley","Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. You alluded to the cost initiatives starting to bear fruit. I think you're targeting $40 million to $50 million in savings over some 18 months or so. Can you kind of update us on where we are in that process?","Fred Lissalde","Yes. And I think you're starting seeing evidence on the results in our Q3. And as Kevin alluded to we will give you some more updates in Q4 call. We started by looking at the SG&A and the corporate costs. And now we take a bit of a more aggressive look at our manufacturing costs and other structural costs and that's the picture that we're going to give you hopefully in early next year. So far on track.","David Kelley","Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And maybe I get the same answer for this question. But just thinking back to your last three-year backlog update, I think 80% of it was tied to EVs and hybrids, clearly weighted more to hybrids though. It seems like over the last few months EV adoption has been a bit softer than most expected particularly in China. Are you more or less bullish today on hybrid adoption and potential sales growth? And do you foresee the pace of EV adoption getting pushed out even further?","Fred Lissalde ","We are bullish on electrification overall. We think that the world is moving towards electrification. And for us with our portfolio it doesn't really matter if it's hybrid or electric. We are in a position to support the customers with whatever they want to do.","David Kelley","But -- okay. Thank you. But just a quick follow-up. You weren't seeing any, I mean, it's got a lot of -- you're getting a lot of traction in China and the EV market. Are you seeing any pullback in customer interest and the technology or transition to hybrids or anything there?","Fred Lissalde","You'll have a little bit of noise driven by incentives. And yes, we saw the EV pull in China getting a little bit choppy. But the contracts are still coming in and we think that the long-term outlook for electric vehicle as well as hybrids in China is very strong for us.","David Kelley","Perfect. Really appreciate the color. Thank you.","Fred Lissalde","Thank you.","Operator","At this time, I will turn the call over to Mr. Nolan.","Patrick Nolan","I'd like to thank you all for your great questions today. If you have any follow-ups, feel free to reach out to me directly. Sharon, you can close the call.","Operator","That does conclude the BorgWarner 2019 third quarter results conference call.

My name is Melissa, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2014 Fourth Quarter and Full Year End Results Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Ken Lamb, VP of Investor Relations. Mr. Lamb, you may begin your conference.","Kenneth Lamb","Thank you, Melissa. Good morning, and thank you, all, for joining us. We issued our earnings release this morning at around 8 a.m. Eastern time. It's posted on our website, borgwarner.com, on our Investor Relations home page. A replay of today's conference call will be available through February 20, also on our website. The dial-in number for that replay is (855) 859-2056. You'll need the conference ID, which is 63271907.","With regard to our Investor Relations calendar, we will be attending the following conferences between now and our next earnings release: February 18, next week, we will be at the Barclays Industrial Select Conference in Miami; April 1, we will be at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch New York Auto Summit.","Now before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today.","Now moving on to our results. James Verrier, President and CEO, will review highlights of our quarterly and full year operating results as well as some of our recent noteworthy accomplishments. And then Ron Hundzinski, our CFO, will discuss the details of our quarterly and full year operating results. With that, I'll turn it over to James.","James R. Verrier","Thank you, Ken, and good day, everybody. Ron and I are very pleased to review our fourth quarter and full year results with you as well as some of our recent accomplishments. Let me take a moment, though, before I begin to thank all of our employees around the world for another outstanding quarter, and it's really tremendous 2014. Your efforts drove great results that continue to lead our industry.","Now onto our results. First of all, the fourth quarter, reported sales were just under $2 billion, which is up 6% from a year ago or 7% when we exclude the impact of foreign currencies on the Wahler acquisition. U.S. GAAP earnings of $0.61 per share or $0.75 per share when we exclude nonrecurring charges. Our operating income margin, again excluding nonrecurring charges, was an impressive 12.4% in the quarter. And 2 key factors drove the strong results: solid sales growth and operational efficiency in the Engine segment and good cost controls across the corporation. Again, it's outstanding performance by our operations.","If I look at the 2 segments, let me start with the Engine segment. We have fourth quarter sales of $1.4 billion, which is up 9% from a year ago. Our sales growth excluded the impact of foreign currencies in Wahler, which also a 9%, as these items offset each other in the quarter. Strong results were led primarily by strong turbocharger sales in Europe, China and Korea.","In the Drivetrain segment, we saw sales of $615 million, which is down 2% from a year ago or up 2% when we exclude the foreign currencies. Drivetrain's sales growth, excluding currency, was driven by higher dual-clutch transmission volumes in Europe, and that was partially offset by a planned slow ramp-up of a major program by a North American customer. Drivetrain continues to grow, and our restructuring plan is very much on track.","This past July, we began moving equipment from our Western European operations to Poland, and these actions are a really critically important to the long-term success of that segment. The segment review really does again highlight BorgWarner's core strengths, shows a product portfolio and high demand in markets around the world, strong operational performance from the Engine segment and good execution of the Drivetrain restructuring plant designed to improve our long-term performance.","Now let me move on to the full year. So reported sales were $8.3 billion, which is up an impressive 11.7%. After excluding the impact of foreign currencies in Wahler, sales were up 8% from 2013. U.S. GAAP earnings were $2.87 per share. And after excluding noncomparable items, net earnings were $3.25 per share, which is up 12% from 2013 on a comparable basis. And our full year operating income margin, when we exclude noncomparable items, was 12.9%. So in all 3 key metrics: sales, earnings and operating income margin, we achieved new records in 2014.","Our financial strength and strong performance is based on our ability to anticipate and drive the next technology waves. And as we look to the future, BorgWarner continues to invest for the long term. Capital spending continues to grow. We spent about 8% of sales on capital in the fourth quarter, which is above our long-term target of 6%. Typically, our capital spending is primarily for machinery and equipment. However, our strong high single, low double-digit growth outlook over the next few years required investment in new plants and plant expansions, which is driving some elevated spending in the near term. We expect this to continue through the end of 2015, after which, we will return to more normalized spending levels. Our investment in R&D was 4% of sales in the quarter, which is in line with our target for the year, and the intensity around organic innovation and product development remains very strong.","I'm also proud to share some of the exciting announcements we made during the last few months. We officially opened our new production plant in Viana do Castelo in Portugal. The state-of-the-art building expands our production capacity to meet growing demand for several exhaust gas recirculation technologies as well as dual-clutch control modules for both passenger cars and commercial vehicles. The new facility provides 50% more manufacturing space to the current rented site in Valen\u00e7a and has additional space for future expansion.","Our facilities in Frankfurt, Illinois, Water Valley, Mississippi and Ithaca, New York, received the 2014 Supplier Quality Excellence Awards from General Motors and also our manufacturing plant in Manesar, India was presented with the 2014 Supplier Quality Excellence Award from GM in India. BorgWarner supplies its advanced turbocharging technology for Volkswagen's latest 1.4 liters four-cylinder gasoline engine for the China market. The wastegated turbocharger applies a mixed flow turbine to deliver superior responsiveness over the entire engine street range.","Also, BorgWarner supplies its inverted silent chain for JATCO's CVT transmission. Our silent chain technology drives the oil pump used to lubricate the system and generate hydraulic pressure to adjust the pulleys that enable TorqTransfer in a continuously variable transmission. And this transmission propels a wide variety of automobiles, including Nissan, Suzuki and Mitsubishi.","We're also supplying our high-performance friction technology for Audi's new DCT transmission. Our advanced technology features an innovative friction plate designed with significantly improved shift quality, helps increase fuel economy and reduce noise, vibration and harshness. Audi's new DCT transmission moves introduced on the Audi A6 platform.","Also, we are supplying our advanced front cross differential or FXD for the new SEAT Leon CUPRA. Designed for high-performance front-wheel-drive vehicles, the electronic limited slip differential significantly improves vehicle handling, traction and stability in nearly all driving conditions. The FXD technology provides automakers with a cost-effective and fuel-efficient alternative to all wheel drive systems. BorgWarner also produces plug top ignition coils with integrated electronics at our proper facility in Ramos, Mexico for Volkswagen 2-liter and 1.8-liter I4 engine built in Mexico. These engines power the Volkswagen Jetta and the Beetle as well as other models designated for the U.S. market. Our complex plug top technology delivers more ignition and higher voltage than conventional plug top or pencil coil ignitions -- coils.","Finally, let me talk about the separate press release that we issued this morning announcing that our board has authorized a share repurchase program of up to $1 billion over the next 3 years. For me to be a little clearer, this is a departure from our previous authorizations, which were open-ended from a timing perspective. Our intention is to execute a $1 billion of share repurchases over the next 3 years, and I believe this program is a clear indication of the following: our confidence in the long-term growth of our business, our expectations for strong free cash flow generation going forward and our continued commitment to create and deliver value to our shareholders.","Now I'll provide an overview of our guidance for 2015, which we gave last month. Sales growth in 2015 is expected to be 2% to 6% or 9.5% to 12% when we exclude the impact of foreign currencies. We expect earnings to be within the range of $3.35 to $3.55 per diluted share or $3.60 to $3.75 excluding the impact of foreign currencies. And our operating margin is expected to be above 13%. This is only a high-level overview of our guidance, and Ron will provide more color to you in his remarks.","So in summary, 2014 was a fantastic year for BorgWarner. And as we look ahead, the industry's continued adoption of our leading-edge powertrain technology combined with operational excellence are the prime reasons I believe we are happy, we still are and we will continue to be leading auto supplier in terms of growth and operating performance. So with that, I'm going to turn the call now over to Ron.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Thanks, James, and good day, everyone. Before I begin reviewing the financials, I would like to also commend all of our employees for their hard work and congratulate them on yet another great year. Now on to our financials.","James already provided a detailed review of our sales performance in the quarter. In summary, sales were up 6% from a year ago or 7% excluding the impact of foreign currencies and the Wahler acquisition. The growth in the quarter came primarily from the Engine segment, which I'll talk more about later. Overall, it was a strong quarter for sales.","Working down the income statement. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 20.7% in the quarter. During the same period, SG&A as a percent of sales was 8.5%. R&D spending, which is included in SG&A, was at 4%. Reported operating income in the quarter was $212 million. However, this includes nonrecurring items related to restructuring activities, a pension plan settlement and intangible asset impairment. The $23 million pretax restructuring charge includes expenses related to the continued relocation of 2 drivetrain facilities from Western to Eastern Europe, the continuing investment in improving Wahler's operational efficiency and footprint and the global legal entity realignment plan intended to enhance treasury management flexibility. The $10 million pretax intangible asset impairment was related to Engine segment on amortized trade names. And the $400,000 pension plan settlement is the remainder of the lump sum payments made to former employees to discharge our obligation under the plan, activity which began in the third quarter.","Excluding nonrecurring items, operating income was $246 million or 12.4% of sales, down 30 basis points from the same period a year ago. Excluding nonrecurring items, very strong performance considering the cost incurred ramping up new plants and restructuring related inefficiencies that we're working through. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, the Wahler acquisition and the nonrecurring items, our year-over-year incremental margin was about 17%, in line with our long-term mid-teens incremental margin target. Again, this is very strong performance considering the cost incurred in ramping up new plants and the restructuring related inefficiencies that we're working through. Note that our new plants in China will be up and running and the Drivetrain restructuring will be completed by the beginning of 2016, both should boost our performance.","As you look further down the income statement, equity and affiliate earnings was just about $12 million in the quarter, in line with last year. This represents the performance of NSK-Warner, our 50-50 joint venture in Japan, which sells transmission components to our Japanese customers in Japan and China, as well as TEL, our turbocharger joint venture in India. Interest expense and finance charges were $10 million in the quarter, up slightly from a year ago. Provision for income taxes in the quarter on a reported basis was $67 million. However, this includes a tax benefit of $4 million related to the nonrecurring charges. Excluding the impact of nonrecurring items, provisions for income taxes was about $71 million, which is an effective tax rate of about 28.6% in the quarter. Our effective tax rate for the full year, excluding noncomparable items, was 28.5%.","Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest were just under $8 million in the quarter, basically flat with the fourth quarter 2013. This line reflects our minority partner's share in the earnings performance of our Korean and Chinese consolidated joint ventures.","That brings us back to net earnings, which were $140 million in the quarter or $0.61 per share. Excluding the impact of nonrecurring items, net earnings were $0.75 per share, outstanding performance for the company. Note that the weaker foreign currencies lowered earnings by about $0.05 per share in the quarter.","As James mentioned, on a comparable basis, 2014 was a record year for sales, operating income margin and EPS. Additionally, our full year incremental margin was 27%, also on a comparable basis. That makes 2 consecutive years of incremental margins in the 30% range for our company. This is an unmatched performance in this industry. We expect great performance again in 2015.","Now let's take a closer look at our operating segments in the quarter. As James said earlier, the reported Engine segment sales were $1.4 billion in the quarter, excluding currency and Wahler. Engine segment sales growth was 9% compared with the same period a year ago. On a reported basis, adjusted EBIT for the Engine segment was 16.4% of sales. Excluding currency and Wahler, adjusted EBIT for the Engine segment was 17.4% of sales or 100 basis points from the 16.4% reported a year ago. That's just fantastic performance.","Excluding currency and Wahler, the Engine segment's year-over-year incremental margin was 29% in the fourth quarter and 28% for the full year. Again, excellent performance for this segment. The restructuring plan for Wahler is on target. The remaining charges will be recorded over the next 2 years or so, after which Wahler is expected to be a double-digit margin business.","In the Drivetrain segment, reported sales were about $615 million in the quarter. Excluding currency, sales growth was about 2% compared with the same period a year ago. Drivetrain faced a tough year-over-year comparison in the fourth quarter. There was a surge in all-wheel drive sales in North America and dual-clutch module sales in Europe for the company a year ago, making it a tough comparison. Also, in the fourth quarter 2014, Drivetrain was impacted by a planned, slow ramp-up of a major program by a North American customer. On a reported basis, adjusted EBIT was 10.7% of sales. Excluding currency, adjusted EBIT was 10.6% of sales. Again, excluding currency, the Drivetrain segment's year-over-year incremental margin was negative 20% in the fourth quarter. But we need to keep this in perspective. Drivetrain lost $1 million of incremental adjusted EBIT on $17 million of incremental sales. That means the segment was about $5 million to $6 million shy of the 15% to 20% incremental margin, which can be attributed to the costs associated with our DCT component plant in Taicang, China that was not yet launched in production and the restructuring-related inefficiencies faced in the quarter.","The Drivetrain restructuring plan is also on target with regard to both timing and cost. We still expect to have the relocations completed by the end of 2015, after which, Drivetrain will be in a much better competitive position in Europe. For the full year, Drivetrain's incremental margin, excluding currency was 27% in 2014, excellent performance considering the challenges faced in the second half of the year. We are very pleased with Drivetrain's performance in 2014. As we look forward, restructuring benefits combined with strong organic growth will drive outstanding performance for the Drivetrain segment for the foreseeable future.","Now let's take a look at the balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $802 million of net cash from operating activities in 2014, up from 100 -- up from $719 million a year ago. The increase was primarily related to higher net earnings. Capital spending, which was $563 million in 2014, up $145 million from a year ago. The increase was driven by capital required to support our backlog of net new business. Free cash flow, which we define as net cash from operating activities less capital spending, was $239 million in 2014, down $57 million from last year, primarily due to higher capital spending.","Looking at the balance sheet itself. Balance sheet debt increased by $117 million at the end of 2014 compared with the end of 2013. Cash decreased by $142 million during the same period. The $259 million increase in net debt was primarily due to dividend payments to shareholders, share repurchases and the Wahler acquisition. We spent nearly 150% of free cash flow on these activities in 2014. Our net debt-to-capital ratio is 12.8%, up from 7.2% at the end of 2013. Net debt-to-EBITDA at the end of the year on a trailing 12-month basis was 0.4x. Our capital structure remains in excellent shape.","Now I'd like to discuss our guidance for 2015 as provided in January. James reviewed our guidance at a high level. I'll discuss some of the finer points. We expect sales growth of 2% to 6% and EPS within a range of $3.35 to $3.55 per diluted share in 2015. However, as James mentioned earlier, these numbers are heavily influenced by currency. Excluding currency, our sales growth is expected to be in the 9.5% to 12% range, and earnings are expected to be within the range of $3.60 to $3.75 per diluted share, very strong performance.","Our operating income margin guidance of above 13% implies a mid-teens incremental margin, which is in line with our long-term target. Finally, our expected diluted share count for 2015 is 229 million shares. This diluted share count guidance excludes any share repurchases that we may execute during the year. However, we announced a repurchase plan of $1 billion in share repurchases over the next 3 years this morning. Our plan is to use cash, existing cash balances and indebtedness and future cash flow to execute that plan.","We continue to be confident in our ability to execute in any market. This company has demonstrated a heightened focus on efficiency and cost. This focus resulted in highly efficient growth and record margins in each of the last 4 years. With our strong organic growth and operations performing at a very high level, 2015 should be another great year for BorgWarner. As we look beyond 2015, we plan to execute our growth plans yielding high single to low double-digit growth and to efficiently convert our sales growth to profits. The future is very bright for BorgWarner. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ken.","Kenneth Lamb","Thanks, Ron. Melissa, can you re-announce the Q&A procedure?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","James, I just wanted to discuss the buyback. So pretty significant number. Does this have any implications for M&A, future M&A and what you're seeing out there?","James R. Verrier","Yes, Rich, the way I would think about it is not at all in terms of any concern around M&A. Our pipeline is still strong. It's robust and we continue to drive, and that's very, very much in our focus to do M&A in addition to the buyback. So there's -- yes, there's no signal there. There's no indication. I think we outlined the primary drivers and purpose for why we're doing the share buyback but don't, for a minute, think that's going to slow down our intensity and commitment around trying to drive M&A because we will.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. All right. And then -- and Ron, the $5 million to $6 million of inefficiencies","[Audio Gap]","you think about over the course of '15? Or is it -- do you expect it to be kind of a lumpy number from quarter-to-quarter?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Rich, I can tell you that, that was the number in the fourth quarter. And going forward, I think, I would -- it's going to be lumpy. I don't see that's a predictable number. We're going to have to take each quarter by quarter and how their performance is. I think that was the number for the fourth quarter.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. All right. And then on CapEx and free cash flow for the fourth quarter. So working capital was below our expectation. CapEx was definitely much higher. The 8% number, that seems much higher relative to the trend. I think you were talking north of 6% this year. How should we think about this for -- as it plays out in '15? And then working capital, were there any headwinds in the quarter that were unique?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Okay, a couple of things. First, CapEx, Rich. I think for 2015, we're going to continue with this upper -- actually, above the upper end of our 5% to 6% of sales CapEx that we typically have as guidance. We're running on the high end of that and I always expect that to go through 2015 as well. I think it's 2016 when we'll we start to see that to come back down into the range. I think we've talked about we're putting in some brick-and-mortar over the last 2 years in various parts of the world, and that bubble, so to speak, will pass through and will go back to more normal machinery and equipment. Getting back to the cap, the working capital, a couple of things, a couple of challenges. Some of -- are decision of our customers took some liberties out of this, I guess, maybe on payments, which typically we don't see. So that was one of the headwinds. So I think we'll get back to a more normal level there.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. All right. And then just to clarify on the CapEx, though, is the 8% present level, is that a realistic outcome for '15? Or is it somewhere between 6% and 8%?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","No. No, I think that what you saw there is you saw a spike in spending in the quarter, given where the sales were. So I think that's just a 1-quarter number that you saw. That's not a number for a full year, Rich.","Kenneth Lamb","Rich, this is Ken. Our actual guidance for CapEx is in our investor presentation. It's around 6.5% to 7% of sales last year.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Right. So just a quarter thing, Rich, is what it was.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Yes, I was just trying to gauge kind of how things will play out for you in a way.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Ron, I've been asked on the major North American customer that's kind of hurting comps for our drivetrain. When does that normalize? Is that early 2015?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","So if you take a look at '14, I believe that customer was running pretty high on volumes in the first 2 quarters of '14 as well. And so it would be more in the second half where you start to see the comps would even out.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, understood. And when you say that you're going to revisit or update the guidance after 1Q, can you remind us what are the moving parts that you are tracking? Is it entirely FX you're kind of waiting for things to stabilize before figuring out what the mark-to-market do? Or are there other items as well?","Kenneth Lamb","I'm glad you asked that, Ravi. Yes, currency is probably the most volatile piece that we're thinking about right now, but there are other factors at play here. Commodity prices, for instance. Volumes are also in play. So our message is that our organic growth, we're still very comfortable with that guidance that we gave back in January, but there other variables at work here that we want to get a few months behind us, kind of see how they play out and then we'll give an update at the end of April.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","If I can just follow up on that, both the commodities and given your kind of underlying guidance, the volume assumption you've made for global growth, I'd assume that both are very -- are being revised up, they're going to be tailwinds.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Ravi, I think we're going to wait for that in the first quarter to give you guidance on that. Okay?","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. I won't jump the gun there. And just finally, on the corporate expenses, $36 million in the quarter, that's -- I think a new record high for you and it was much higher than what we were expecting. Can you help us understand what's going on there and what's a good run rate for 2015?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Absolutely, Ravi. So you're right. That number is very high, but a couple of things I want to point out. One is the items in there, which I talked about in the second were noncash items. They were not spendings. So to answer your question, the run rate is going to come back to more what you saw probably in the 3 quarters of the year of 2014. So what was in there? Basically, at the end of the year, there's a couple, I'll call them mumbo-jumbo accounting, transactions we have to do. So for example, intercompany profits on inventory, we have to adjust for and LIFO adjustments we have to adjust for. And they were actually a bit higher than normal than we anticipated and that's what's sitting in there. That's basically the whole difference. So that was just a 1 quarter adjustment. It's -- that's all that was, noncash and we go back to more normal run rate going forward.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. I'll clarify the CPA definition of mumbo-jumbo offline.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","It's interesting I used mumbo-jumbo, but the other thing is if you take that off, the performance at the segment level was outstanding. That was the focus here, right? [indiscernible] if you're looking for performance. Okay. All right.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a first question, as we think about the pace of buybacks because obviously it's a big program. I'm just curious, do you think you're going to be soaking up your free cash flow to do this? Or would you be willing to take on some net leverage to get this done maybe sooner rather than later? And I'm just trying to understand what would be your sort of net leverage limits or targets as you kind of work through this process and think about acquisitions as well?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Yes, I'll talk about the first part and then maybe James can talk about the acquisition side of that. We have a lot of opportunities, John, to use. We have existing cash, we have free cash flow that's being generated and we also have indebtedness that we can use as well. So I have a full suite of possibilities that I can pull triggers on to execute this plan. We're very confident and comfortable we can do that as well. So I have no issues in that part of our execution. On the M&A front and how that plays in the M&A, again -- actually, James, I want to answer this. On the M&A front, we still have a lot of capacity on the balance sheet for M&A activity. So James was asked this question earlier. This, by no means, takes away anything on the M&A front. We have capacity to execute the share buyback. We have capacity to execute M&A activity. We're very comfortable.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And maybe just to follow up on that. I'm just trying to understand if we look at the end of 2015, and the shares haven't moved much. I mean, could we be looking at the bulk of this buyback having been executed? I'm just trying to gauge the pace. I mean, is there a target of 1\/3, 1\/3, 1\/3 over the next 3 years? Or is this going to be opportunistic and you've got a lot of room on leverage?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","John, we're not going to give guidance as far as any numbers in this area. But to answer your question, yes, we're going to take advantage of opportunities when they present themselves. And when they do, we'll be more aggressive, for example. And that's how we're going to do the buybacks. It's not going to be any kind of linear number or anything we're going to do. But we'll use all of our balance sheet, we'll use the cash flow -- free cash flow and the existing cash balances to do it as well.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And then as we look at Drivetrain, I mean, the margins this year, in aggregate, aren't anything really to apologize for but obviously there's some near-term headwinds here with the F-150 changeover and the restructuring you're executing in Europe. Just curious, as we think about those margins and ultimately where they can go as you work through these sort of transitory issues, I mean, is there any reason to think that you might not be able to get the Drivetrain margins near with the engine group margins are over time? I'm just trying to understand the potential magnitude of upside as we get into 16, '17 and '18.","James R. Verrier","Yes, yes. And that's a good thought, John, and I appreciate your acknowledgment that ours still a pretty strong year, particularly if we kind of look back a couple of years. I think a really critical part for me, John, is that this restructuring activity that we're undertaking, which is causing a little bit of short-term headwind is all to support our growth. And so there's 2 primary drivers that we've got going for us. One, we've got a strong growth outlook that, obviously, are more capitalized on the incremental revenue plus we're coming from a better cost optimization because of the restructuring. Those 2 things combined are going to take margins up that -- I feel very comfortable with that. In terms of putting up a precise number, John, in terms of 2 or 3 years out, I think we still want to get through this year. But we've not peaked on Drivetrain margins. We've got room to grow and we will over the next couple of years, John.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly on gas prices. I mean, there's a lot of concern we're hearing from investors just on the short run that there could be some pressure on the business. I mean, have you seen anything on mix on a gross basis or on a net basis between the 2 groups that would cause you any concern just in the short run?","James R. Verrier","The quick -- the real quick answer, John, is there's actually no concern from a BorgWarner viewpoint. And I would articulate that in 2 aspects. One, if you take the short run, the short-term stuff that you're alluding to, first of all, as we know, it's predominantly a U.S.-related issue. I think that's fair to say. So that's about 25% of our total revenue. But even so, even when we see that mix shift in a quarter or over a period of time, in the mix between cars and trucks, it's actually neutral to favorable for us. We have a lot of gas price. And if you think about that intuitively, if you look at the typical content that you would see on the larger vehicles, when you think of things like transport cases, you think of turbos and other things, we benefit from the low price in the short run in North America. And then over the long run, which is the other question obviously we're asked, could this influence CapEx pushouts or adjustments, our view on that is we don't see anything meaningful there. We think the trend is in place for continued push on drive on fuel economy and emissions and we're not seeing anything at all in terms of adoption rates of technology or discussions around technologies that will launch in 3 years, 5 years, 6 years out. So quick answer, really in the short run, it's neutral to favorable and in the long term, no change.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just want to kind of go in a little bit on some of the stuff you talked about in pricing in Detroit Auto Show, how that actually kind of played out as you kind of locked down the quarter and kind of went in to the price discussions for 2015. You talked about 2% price-downs in 2015. We've been typically seeing 1.5% before. Were you being conservative there? We had a period of low oil prices or OEMs kind of pushing back a little bit more than they used to. Is there any change in the competitive dynamic and, I guess, related to that my follow-on question will be kind of how does nickel and commodities play in to those discussions?","Kenneth Lamb","Brian, this is Ken. So -- first of all, let me clarify for you. The guidance that we gave around pricing was around a 2% decline this year versus last year, which is very much in line with what we've given guidance -- or the guidance that we've given over the long term. It was not a change from previous guidance. So I want to make sure that, that's clear. So the idea around commodity prices playing into that, doesn't really have an effect on that. We have quite a bit of pass-through on nickel. I think you flagged nickel, so pricing is affected by that. But this particular discussion around price-downs is a bit separate from that. And I just want to reiterate that, that 2% decline was no different than any guidance we've given in the past.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And in terms of the timing of pass-through on nickel, how should we be thinking about that vis-\u00e0-vis the quarterly cadence?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Yes, Brian, this is Ron. I'm not just going to focus on nickel. I'd like to focus on commodities, in general. You have a myriad number of options when you talk about commodity pass-throughs. Sometimes they're set on a quarter basis, sometimes they're set on a half-year basis and some commodities are actually done yearly. So to put one simple number on it is very difficult. It all depends on the commodity, all depends on the customers. But generally, there are lags. I will say that there's lags when you pass them up and there's lags when you pass them down. It's not everything single month, you mark-to-market, so to speak. But there are lags, and the lags, can -- like I said, depend on 1 quarter to 2 quarters to a full year.","Operator","The next question comes from David Leiker with Robert W. Baird & Company.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Your actions on Drivetrain in Europe as you work through that near the end of this year and the next year or so, what kind of opportunities does that present you for going after new businesses? I guess a different way, has your cost structure been an impediment to getting new business or just margins? And does this open an opportunity to be more aggressive?","James R. Verrier","I would say, David, what I was maybe trying to articulate earlier, our growth is still very strong for Drivetrain. What this does is it just keeps us or makes us very competitive, I mean, as we optimize that footprint. It just makes us competitive. When I look at -- over the over the last few years in terms of our win rates and how we've been doing in market share type metrics, we've been doing well, and I think this will continue to keep that momentum going. In addition to that, it's absolutely helping us from a margin perspective and we'll continue to do. So it's a little bit of both, David. It helps fuel and support our growth while being competitive and it's helping in the margin side as well by the competitiveness as well.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. And then one other item here. We've been hearing here in the last couple of months more discussions about dual-clutch transmissions coming into the commercial vehicle space. Is that an area that you're able to play in and participate?","Kenneth Lamb","Yes, David. That is an area that I think you're going to see us participate in. We are very much participating now, and that we expect that to continue going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of, like, clarifications. First, just on the impact of lower gas prices, just one item I was curious about. How much flexibility in programs is there for customers on the take rate whether they have a turbopower -- a turbocharge powertrain or a naturally aspirated? I know that exists for certain programs like the F-150, but my impression was that it wasn't really there in a lot of vehicles and a lot of engines. So one would be tempted to conclude that no matter what gas prices do, a lot of what's in going in for the next few years is kind of baked in. Is that correct or incorrect?","Kenneth Lamb","I think you're more right than wrong on that. The backlog, as you know, is booked. So as we look at programs for the next 3 years, that gives it, as you put it, kind of locked and loaded. So we feel comfortable with that. And when we get out 5, 6 years from now, there's a little bit more flexibility, but certainly over the next few years, we feel very comfortable with that. And you did highlight that turbochargers is maybe one potential where people can pick that option or not, but that's maybe the only one. As we think about it, the rest of our technology, they're on those engines, they're on those transmissions and there's not a lot of consumer options or they're thinking about different options as it relates to those other technologies. So I think that overall, that our backlog will not be affected by this change in oil prices. And let's not forget, this is a U.S. phenomenon and a lot of our backlog is outside of the U.S. as well, where this change in oil prices doesn't affect the consumer much at all.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Well, that's helpful. One other clarification for from me. Just -- I mean, you guys have given a pretty good breakdown of some of those items that are potentially weighing on contribution margin over the year, all right, the new facilities, the restructuring in Drivetrain. But from a quarterly perspective, by the end of this year, beginning of next, is it -- are those front-end loaded costs that really have the bulk of their impact in the first and second quarter? Or do they kind of stretch all the way through the year?","Kenneth Lamb","Well, I think, when we talk about the Drivetrain restructuring -- I'll do this in pieces. The Drivetrain restructuring, Ron has said earlier, is going to be kind of lumpy, hard to predict. But we think that there's going to be impact throughout the year to varying degrees. One impediment was the large North American program that impacted that. That should be in the first half of this year and we should be about have that behind us when we get to the second half of the year. And the new plants ramping up, that's probably going to continue through the year as well, again lumpy. We're ramping them up. We're talking about hiring people, getting the plant ready to go, so that's not a straight line either. I think the way to think about it is this stuff will be behind us by the end of the year. And 2016 is going to be very good launching off point for improved performance.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Understood. Okay, so perhaps a little bit more front-end loaded with the large program piece, but the other guys are kind of spread throughout?","Kenneth Lamb","Yes, I think that's fair.","James R. Verrier","[indiscernible]","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then last, just more of a structural question, I mean, you mentioned it on the call, 30% contribution margins for the last 2 years, which is higher than most of us had thought you would get to. And now even with -- beyond the restructuring and some of the transitional issues that you have this year, you're talking to something more in the mid-teens, right, on a sustainable basis. And I don't want to sound like a spoiled brat or something, but why -- like, what is the structural difference between 2 years ago and in the future once you're beyond some of this frictional issues? Why -- is it just sort of later in the cycle, higher levels of utilization, why structurally is the business not staying at the 30? Again, I don't want to make it sound like a complaint. Just trying to understand the drivers.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Sure, Pat. So really, what you have going on is if I go back a little bit of history and understand that as volumes start to ramp up, you're able to leverage more of your manufacturing utilization to a certain point. And once you meet that, you hit this mass point of utilization in your capital, you have to put in more capital infrastructure. What that does is it starts to bring down those incremental margins. You're not running very efficiently is what you're doing. So for a short period of time, you're seeing good margins, incremental margins because you're utilizing your capital. As you reach this fixed point, you have to put in capital. As you put this capital in, which is what we've been doing in the last half of this year, the incremental margins start to come down. So that's 2 points I'm bringing up -- I'm talking about as you expand and when you in capital. On a steady-state basis, which is what I typically use, Ken is a little bit different, on a steady state, you're putting capital at the same rate of your growth. So your incremental margins tend to blend at mid-teens. We hadn't been in that steady state. We would be in one state, we're in another state. The business needs to run at steady state. And at steady state, you put in capital at the same rate your sales grow, your cost structure, you're adding a plant here and there. You're adding people in those plants and those incremental margins will be the mid-teens as you're in steady state.","Operator","Your next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Credit Agricole Securities.","Emmanuel Rosner - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask you first a quick clarification on the buyback program. Is it -- this new $1 billion, is it in addition to what you had left on the existing authorization? I think as of last quarter, if I remember well, it was something like 10 million shares which is at current stock price also a decent amount of change?","Kenneth Lamb","So this program is going to utilize the shares that were existing on that authorization. So we had about 8.6 million shares remaining. We'll use those shares as part of this $1 billion share repurchase program.","Emmanuel Rosner - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. So it's $1 billion from now basically including those?","Kenneth Lamb","That's correct.","James R. Verrier","Yes.","Emmanuel Rosner - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And so just another point of clarification, the -- I think back at the Detroit Auto Show, you were saying you're essentially waiting for some clarity on your legal restructuring before making a move. Is that -- do you have that clarity now? Or did you just decide to go ahead and then announce the program now and then you will eventually get this legal restructuring done?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Yes. So we've been, for the last 2 years, working on a legal restructuring program. And as we come into 2015, we do now have complete clarity that we're going to be able to execute and finalize this program in 2015. So yes, that came into the decision.","Emmanuel Rosner - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay, perfect. And then one final one for me. Just wanted to speak about the topic of diesel. We've seen some, I guess, pressure on the diesel mix in Europe as well as Western countries, making some efforts to sort of, in fact, maybe reduce the diesel penetration at the government level. I wanted to ask you, can you please just go over the math of what impact it has on you when, I guess, with equal purchase the oil produced, I guess, is gas versus diesel oil, specifically in Europe if possible?","James R. Verrier","Yes, Emmanuel, this is James. I would say our view, which we talked about in Detroit also, was we see over the next year or 2 there may be some slight erosion in terms of diesel share versus gas in Europe, primarily. We don't see a big shift change. We do see a couple of percentage points it may move. That generally won't move the needle meaningfully for BorgWarner because we have pretty good content on gas as well as diesel. If you break it down into more detail, in the short run, we'll probably have a little more benefit from diesel. But over the next 2, 3, 4 years, that's going to balance out as we see more and more of our technologies getting adopted onto gasoline vehicles. And therefore, those shifts will become neutral for BorgWarner over the next 2 or 3 years. So not a big deal for us is the quick summary, Emmanuel.","Operator","All right. Your next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.","Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I think a lot has been answered, but maybe just going back to the backlog call in November. Remember when you moved from a single-point estimate to a range. Obviously, it's very early in 2015, but a few months have passed since then. I'm curious if you have any insight into whether you might be tracking in more toward the higher or lower end of that range. $850 million to $950 million so, for example, for 2015, let's say.","Kenneth Lamb","Yes, that range is fully represented in our guidance. And you may actually do the math on the guidance, and it pretty closely ties to $850 million at the low end and $950 million at the high end. And as you know, we haven't really had a change since that initial guidance was given. So I think that's a very long way of saying we haven't really given any sort of guidance as where we're falling within that range as of yet. What we did say today was we feel very comfortable about the organic growth of this business. And that range, we're still very comfortable with.","Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. That's great. And then with the repurchase announcement, I mean, we had expected that you would buy back almost that amount of stock, but maybe that the announcement might come a little bit later. Does this mean that you had made a little bit more progress than you earlier thought when you had that dinner last year about repatriating cash from overseas? Is that process been going well or is that not necessarily related like we thought maybe it would be through an announcement.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Yes, I would say that when we talked about it last summer, we had a plan and we're on track on that plan. And a good thing happens as we got into this year and we kept on track, our confidence level was enhanced, right, whereby we're comfortable making the decision of making an announcement of the buyback. So we stayed on track, the confidence was gained and then we thought that the announcement was appropriate this time.","Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then your response to an earlier question about how consumers are changing their behaviors as a result of lower gas prices. It was really interesting, really helpful and I understand you got some all-wheel drive stuff that benefit from CDs and stuff. And it was touched on what could happen with CAFE standards, but maybe if you could just revisit that in a little bit greater depth. There's this potential, I guess, medium term review, but it's very soft review. Can you just kind of maybe describe the process? I'm sure you're more familiar with it than we are or the investors are. And Ford made a comment at the Detroit Auto Show saying something's got to give here. We agreed to this stuff, not that they had a whole lot of choice in agreeing to it, when gas was substantially higher. And they're even saying that like if the government doesn't relent somewhat, then maybe people won't buy as many vehicles, and the new vehicles are more efficient than the old vehicles or it could be counterproductive and they want to talk with them. So I'm just curious if you had any sort of better insight than us into how the process might play out in 2017 or what the rules are or whatnot.","James R. Verrier","Sure. James here, Ryan. So the way I think about it is that midterm review, it's part of the process. It's part of the scheduled review. And I think I'm going to go through that meaningful review as planned. I think that'll play out. Our view, as we sit here and talk to a lot of different people, is we're not anticipating or envisaging any significant change in the CAFE standards. That doesn't mean there may not be minor tweaks in language or numbers, but I don't think there's going to be anything materially moving, from our viewpoint, around CAFE standards. Let me maybe just give you one example of why you think that. When you look at the development cycle for, particularly powertrain type product transmission or an engine, that splits along -- that's a long gestation period of 2, 3 or 4 years to get that technology ready to go. And those programs often have a 7- to 10-year life. So -- and those are very, very capital-intensive, big investments that are made. So all of that stuff that's been going on, that's all being put into the works. And I -- based on that, I just don't -- I don't think that's going to be a meaningful shift. So I think it'll -- I think I'll go through the process as outlined, as you articulated. But I don't see any meaningful change or difference to the OE strategies and, therefore, the BorgWarner strategies.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Ron, just to follow up on the tax repatriation strategy which is helpful color. I mean, who knows what will happen with Obama's recent proposal, but if something along those lines does go through, will that throw off your current strategy or change your thinking at all?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Joe, a couple of years ago we were hoping for some sort of tax reform, and we didn't get it. I'd say that we just have to stay with our plan and if anything happens then, it's a benefit that will be great for everybody. But at the end of the day, you have to run your business and execute your plan, and that's the path I'm on.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just -- well, one more quick one on -- I appreciate the $4 million to $5 million hit that you talked about in powertrain, and that will be -- continue to be lumpy. That does seem to be maybe a little bit towards the higher end. So is it fair to say that $4 million to $5 million is higher on a lumpy scale?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","No, because I don't have absolute knowledge of they're going to be going forward. All I can tell you is that given the stuff we saw in the fourth quarter, it is that amount of money and as -- Ken did a good job as well saying that we have a start-up in China. That's a different issue, and then you've got relocation in Eastern Europe, which is actually a different issue. The reason I say that is the start-up has a planned cost base in there and we're getting ready for sales and shipments. So that's a little bit more predictable. Now the European structure side of it is a little more unpredictable because they're moving equipment and you're getting inefficiencies and then you may get efficiencies and they may come across something that's not working well. So one is a little bit more predictable and one is less predictable.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just real quick on equity income, which is down a little bit. I'm assuming that you had some FX hit in there? Is that fair and is it is possible to quantify?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","[indiscernible] That's a good question. I'm surprised that no one really asked that earlier, and you're absolutely right. It was FX related for the quarter or translation. I want to be more specific, translational currency effects in there, yes.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","All right. Is it possible to sort of give an indication of what that venture is doing organically?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","I would say that we have 2 major joint ventures there. One is in India that's been -- very good performance. And this K1 that ships into China. So the performance over there has been very good as well.","Operator","We have time for one final question, and that question comes from Itay Michaeli with Citi.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So I just want to go back to the raw material incremental margin discussion. Ron, can you just remind us what percentage of your raw material buy is passed through? And how should we think about the impact on incremental margins? So I would think that even for the pass-through element as raw materials decline and you kind of get back pass-through lower revenue, will that optically help the incremental module for you in 2015?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Itay, there's a lot of commodities involved and a lot of timing differences to put a simple analysis around what you're trying to do. I know logically what you're trying to get at and there is a calculation but it's much, much more complex to make it that simple. But what I would say is that over a period of time, there -- the shift and those timings are not material to our business where it would affect incremental margins significantly on BorgWarner. I can say that, okay? Maybe in other businesses, it can. We're too large of an organization with a lot of different commodities to have any significant impact on our total numbers.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. That's helpful. And then just a big picture, a product development question. You launched a lot of product recently, particularly on electrified vehicles, both for stop\/start and others. So just a question, just an update on how things are going there in terms of both developing product, going to market and your discussions with automakers as you pursue some of these new products that you have.","James R. Verrier","Yes, Itay, the thrust, if you wish, around continued electrification focus for BorgWarner particularly remains strong and we've seen over recent years product, specifically enabling and supporting stop\/start type of technologies, just to name a couple. And we continue to be very engaged with the automakers on the electrification of our current products, as an example. But also, as we see the evolution towards different forms of hybrid and 48-volt architectures that, that's leading to enhanced product opportunities for us. A quick example there would be different forms of electrical turbochargers would be an example. And then in the pure battery electric vehicle space, we've participated there and we anticipate playing in that space as we go forward, too. So in other words, saying it is, electrification absolutely is a content-add growth opportunity for BorgWarner and we're seeing more and more of that play out both through our organic actions and also as we look to acquisitions as well. I think it will be complementary as we look forward.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","James, and then just back on the midterm review. Yes, it was my understanding, just wondering if you have the same understanding that the review really is for the 2022 to 2025 time frame and not before that. So if there are any changes in the next few years, that's really the period in focus. Is that your understanding as well? Or is there some flexibility in terms of if there are changes made maybe affecting regulations prior to that?","James R. Verrier","No, I'm sure pretty much of a similar view that you talked. We may both be wrong but, I guess, we're at least having a similar view there. That's my interpretation.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And just lastly, just a clarification. If the company's leverage target, Ron, still in that 15% to 30% net debt-to-capital or has that changed at all?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","No, no change. That is our target.","Kenneth Lamb","Thank you, Itay. And I'd like to thank all of you for joining us. We expect to file our 10-K before the end of the day, which will provide details of our results. If you have any follow-up questions about our earnings release, the matters discussed during this call or our 10-K, please direct them to me.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to BorgWarner 2013 First Quarter Results Earnings Conference Call.[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Ken Lamb, Director, Investor Relations. Mr. Lamb, you may begin your conference.","Ken Lamb","Thank you, Michelle. Good morning and thank you, all, for joining us. We issued our earnings release this morning at approximately 8 a.m. Eastern Time, it's posted on our website, borgwarner.com, on our homepage. A replay of today's conference call will be available through May 2. The dial-in number for the replay is (800) 585-8367. You'll need the confidence ID, which is 29703435.

Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today.","Now moving onto our results. James Verrier, President and CEO, will comment on first quarter results and current industry trends; and then Ron Hundzinski, our CFO, will discuss the details of our operating results and also our outlook for 2013.","With that, I'll turn the call over to James.","James R. Verrier","Thank you, Ken, and good day, everyone. Today, I'm really pleased to review our first quarter results, as well as our first quarter accomplishments. First of all, I'd like to congratulate all of the BorgWarner employees on an excellent first quarter. Your efforts drove outstanding results in a very challenging environment.","Now let me talk about our results. Reported sales were $1.9 billion, which is down 1% from a year ago, excluding the impact of foreign currencies and dispositions made in the last 12 months. U.S. GAAP earnings were $1.22 per share, but excluding noncomparable items, earnings were $1.30 per share. Our reported operating income margin was 10.7%, but again, excluding noncomparable items, our operating income margin was an impressive 11.7% in the quarter. And Ron will discuss the noncomparable items later.","Two key factors drove our strong results. Sales were impacted by a weak production environment, most notably light vehicles in Europe and commercial vehicle in Europe and North America. Operational efficiency and cost controls enabled us to post a strong operating margin, despite these challenging market conditions.","Let me talk about the Engine Group. In the first quarter, sales were over $1.2 billion, that's down less than 1% from a year ago after excluding the impact of foreign currencies and dispositions made during the last 12 months. These results were led by higher sales of variable cam timing systems in Japan and emission systems in Asia and the Americas. These positive results were more than offset by the lower production volumes we saw in Europe.","In the Drivetrain Group, sales were about $610 (sic) \u0081 million, that's down about 2% from the first quarter of 2012 when we exclude foreign currencies. Drivetrain results were driven by increased overall drive system sales in North America and Korea and growth in traditional AT component sales in Korea. Again, these positives were offset by lower production volumes in Europe. So our earnings of $1.30 per share, when we exclude the noncomparable items, was a new first quarter record. It's a tremendous accomplishment considering the weak conditions in which it was achieved.","Let me look at a little bit to the future and BorgWarner continues to invest for the long term. Capital spending continues to grow. In the quarter, we spent about 5% of sales and we remain committed to supporting our future growth and productivity improvements. Spending for R&D was about 3.9% of sales in the quarter, that's just under the 4% that we target for R&D spending.","I'd also like to review some of the exciting announcements we made during the quarter.","BorgWarner's regulated 3-stage turbocharging system won 2 2013 Automotive News PACE Awards at a ceremony held in Detroit, Michigan earlier this month. We're very proud once again to be recognized as innovators and game changers in the industry. BorgWarner supplies its latest turbocharging technology for a new generation of medium-duty engines from Mercedes-Benz, the first commercial vehicle manufacturer to achieve Euro VI compliance of all its medium and heavy-duty engines.","We also opened 2 new production facilities -- a new production facility in Itatiba City in Brazil, which is twice the size of our former facility in Campinas. And we'll be producing several technologies at the facility for passenger cars and commercial vehicles, such as turbochargers, thermal systems, engine timing systems and emissions technologies.","BorgWarner advanced technologies are on the 2013 North American Car and Truck of the Year winners, the Cadillac ATS and the Ram 1500. For the Cadillac ATS, BorgWarner supplies friction plates and one-way clutches for the 6-speed automatic transmission and transfer case systems for the all-wheel drive models. And on the Ram 1500, BorgWarner produces viscous fan drives for the V8 engines, timing systems for models equipped with the Pentastar engine, friction plates for the 8-speed automatic transmission and transfer case system for 4-wheel drive models. We're very proud to contribute our technologies to these outstanding vehicles.","Also, BorgWarner Turbo Systems received a Daimler Supplier Award in 2012 in recognition of outstanding performance in quality, cost and delivery and reliability. Also 2 BorgWarner facilities received 2012 Supplier Quality Excellence Awards from General Motors. These awards recognize supplier manufacturing locations for consistently exceeding defined quality performance criteria.","Now let me shift and talk a little bit about the current outlook for 2013 light vehicle production, which is unchanged from our previous view. We expect global production volumes to be up approximately 1% from 2012. In North America, we expect production volumes to be up 3% for 2012. Europe down 3%. China up 10%. And Japan, down 10%.","In the commercial vehicle markets, generally, we expect stability in 2013, but not much growth. In Europe and North America, we expect production to be pretty much flat with 2012. In China, we now expect to see a double-digit decline in commercial vehicle production in 2013 compared to 2012. Our original expectation was flat; however, we've seen some weakened demand that has caused to lower our expectations. In Brazil, however, we do still see the potential for low, double-digit growth.","Finally, our sales and earnings guidance for 2013 also remains unchanged. Sales growth in 2013 is expected to be between 2% and 6%, or 3% to 7% when you exclude the 2012 dispositions. Our 2013 earnings guidance remains at $5.15 to $5.45 per share, and our operating margin is expected to be 11.5% or better for the year. So with 1 quarter behind us, I remain confident that 2013 will be another strong year for BorgWarner.","In conclusion, the macroenvironment, it certainly has challenges, especially in Europe. However, BorgWarner's financial results underscored our operational proficiency and our ability to manage costs during challenging times. And as we look ahead, we see that outlook for our business remains strong. In 2013, we expect to grow sales and profits for the fourth year in a row with more growth to come in 2014 and beyond. No company in the auto sector is better positioned for long-term profitable growth than BorgWarner. The industry's adoption of our leading edge powertrain technology will continue for years. And because of this, I feel very, very good about the company's future.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ron.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Thanks, James, and good day, everyone. Before I begin reviewing the financials, I'd like to put BorgWarner's performance into perspective relative to the industry.","Global light vehicle production was down 1% in the quarter compared with the same quarter last year. BorgWarner's reported sales were down 3% from a year ago. As James explained earlier, if we exclude impact of foreign currencies and M&A activity in 2012, our sales in the quarter were down 1%.","To get a clear picture of performance relative to our markets, we need to review the light vehicle and commercial vehicle markets separately. First, let's take a closer look at the light vehicle market from a regional perspective. In Asia, which I'm defining as China, Korea and Japan, light vehicle production was up 2%. Our light vehicle sales in Asia, excluding currency, were up 11%. In Europe, light vehicle production was down around 9%. Our light vehicle sales, excluding currency in 2012 disposals, were down 5%. In North America, light vehicle production was down 1%, our light vehicle sales growth in North America was about 1% positive, slightly better than the market.","Now let's review the commercial vehicle market. Commercial vehicle production was up in Brazil, but was lower in China and North America. Europe was basically flat. As a result, our commercial vehicle sales were down nearly 10% in the quarter.","Our typical outperformance of the light vehicle market by 8 to 10 percentage points was impacting[ph] Asia in the first quarter. We also outperformed the market in Europe, but less than typical, which is primarily due to unfavorable mix. While the entire light vehicle market was down 9% in Europe, the high end of the market, where BorgWarner has most of the content, was down more relative to 2012. Weak commercial vehicle markets resulted in a near 10% sales decline for us in a segment representing nearly 20% of our business.","Working down the income statement. Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 20.2% for the quarter, that's down slightly from 20.7% a year ago and includes about $3 million of higher raw material prices. SG&A were -- was 8.6% of sales in the quarter versus 8.8% of sales in the first quarter 2012. R&D spending, which is included in SG&A, was 3.9% of sales in the first quarter, up 40 basis points from a year ago. This implies a 60 basis point decline in other SG&A spending. We attribute the lower SG&A spending to good execution of our cost control plan and lower stock-based compensation expense.","Reported operating income in the quarter was $199 million. However, this includes 2 noncomparable items. First, there was $6 million of retirement-related obligations. This is the final charge related to the company's decision to waive the forfeiture provisions of existing stock grants to certain retiring executive officers. Second, there was $11 million charge related to a program termination agreement. A program was terminated after investments and commitments to invest have been made by a customer, BorgWarner and our supply chain. This is the impact of BorgWarner of the agreement payments. Excluding these charges, operating income was $216 million or 11.7% of sales, compared with $226 million or 11.8% of sales on a comparable basis a year ago. Excluding the 40% -- the 40 basis points increase in R&D spending, our operational spending was down 30 basis points on lower sales. After excluding the impact of foreign currency and noncomparable items in both this quarter and the first quarter of 2012, our decremental margin was around 19%, in line with our targeted 20%. This is outstanding performance. We are on track to achieve our operating margin target of 11.5% or better for the year.","As you look further down the income statement, equity in affiliate earnings was $10 million in the quarter, up from $9 million last year. This represents the performance of NSK-Warner, our 50-50 joint venture in Japan which sells transmission components to our Japanese customers in Japan and China, as well as TEL, our turbocharger joint venture in India.","Interest expense and finance charges were $10 million in the quarter, down from $15 million a year ago. This was primarily due to the maturity of our convertible debt settled with treasury shares in April of last year. Provision for income taxes was $51 million in the quarter, which is a 25.5% effective tax rate. However, the provision includes: a $2 million tax benefit associated with retirement-related obligations, I mentioned earlier; a $4 million tax benefit associated with the program termination settlement; and a $2 million of net favorable tax adjustments, which was primarily due to R&D credits resulting from the retroactive impact of U.S. legislation enacted in January of 2013. Excluding these items, our tax expense was 55 -- $59 million in the quarter or a run rate, effective tax rate of 27%, which, I'll note, is in line with our 2013 guidance.","Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests were $6.5 million in the quarter, up from $5.7 million a year ago. This line reflects our minority partner's share in the earnings performance of our Korean and Japanese consolidated joint ventures. That brings us back to net earnings, which were $142 million in the quarter or $1.22 per share on a reported basis. On a comparable basis, net earnings were $152 million in the quarter or $1.30% per share, up 2% from $1.28 per share a year ago. That's a 2% increase in earnings per share on a - on lower sales. Outstanding performance for a company considering the challenging market conditions.","Now let's take a closer look at our operating groups. Engine Group sales were $1.26 billion in the quarter. Excluding currency and 2012 dispositions, Engine Group sales were down 1% compared with the first quarter in 2012. Adjusted EBIT for the Engine Group was $202 million in the quarter or 16.1% of sales, that's up slightly from 16% reported a year ago. Excluding currency and 2012 dispositions, our year-over-year decremental margin was 19%. Great performance for the Engine Group.","In the Drivetrain Group, sales were $600 million in the quarter. Excluding currency, Drivetrain sales were down 2% compared with the first quarter of 2012. On a reported basis, adjusted EBIT was $56 million or 9.3% of sales, down from 10% a year ago. The year-over-year decremental margin for Drivetrain, excluding currency, was about 35%. The year-over-year comparison was challenging, considering the first quarter 2012 was a peak quarter for the -- for profitability for Drivetrain. Tough comparison aside, we view this that there is room for improvement in Drivetrain and we are focusing our attention on improving the group's performance.","If you look at the balance sheet and cash flow, we generated $16 million of net cash from operating activities in the first quarter, down $15 million from the first quarter 2012. Capital spending was $87 million in the quarter, down $8 million from the same period a year ago. This is primarily really due to foreign currency. Our capital spending is required to support our program launches around the world, particularly in Asia, South America, Eastern Europe and Mexico. Free cash flow during that period, which we define as net cash from operating activities, less capital spending, including tooling, was an outflow of $71 million, which is a typical seasonal occurrence. Our investment in working capital is typically substantial in the first quarter as business activity picks up from the end of the fourth quarter levels.","Looking at the balance sheet. Balance sheet debt increased by $134 million compared with the end of 2012. Cash decreased by $20 million during the same period. This $154 million increase in net debt was primarily due to seasonal working capital funding requirements I mentioned earlier and share repurchases. We spent $15 million repurchasing about 650,000 shares in the first quarter, leaving 2.5 million shares on the previous authorization. Yesterday, our board authorized the purchase of an additional 5 million shares of the company's common stock on the open market, bringing the total number of shares authorized for repurchase up to 7.5 million shares.","At the end of the quarter, our net debt-capital ratio was 13.8%, just outside of our targeted range of 15% to 30%. But up from 10% at the end of 2012. Net debt-to-EBITDA at the end of the quarter on a trailing 12-month basis was 0.4x. Our capital structure remains in excellent shape.","Now I'd like to discuss our guidance for 2013, which is unchanged from what was provided in January and reiterated in February. James reviewed our guidance at a high level. I'll discuss more of the finer points here.","Our sales growth expectations of 2% to 6%, or 3% to 7% excluding 2012 dispositions, still assumes no currency impact. We recognize that the euro is trending stronger than our original guidance of $1.28. But conversely, the Japanese yen and the Brazilian real are trending weaker than expected. This net impact of foreign currencies in the first quarter was minimal as the weakening yen and the real offset the strength in euro. We will continue to monitor foreign currencies and provide updates as needed.","We expect raw material inflation of $15 million to $20 million in 2013, down from just under $30 million in 2012. As James mentioned earlier, our operating margin -- operating income margin is expected to be 11.5% or better in 2013. In other words, despite lower sales growth, we expect to come very close to maintaining margins this year compared with 2012. Slower sales growth will mean less incremental income to offset the inflationary cost pressures. But we expect to supplement our incremental income with increased productivity gains and spending controls as seen in the first quarter.","Our diluted share count at the end of 2012 was approximately 117 million shares. This is the proximate share count on which our guidance is based. Any dilution from equity-based compensation in 2013 is assumed to be offset by share repurchases. Any additional share repurchases that we may execute over the course of the year are not factored into our guidance.","We continue to be very confident in our ability to execute in any market. This company has demonstrated a heightened focus on efficiency and cost controls since the 2009 recession. This focus resulted in highly efficient growth and record margins in each of the last 3 years. Weak market conditions, particularly in Europe, will likely result in sales growth below[ph] our long-term trend in 2013. Despite this, 2013 should be another year of record sales and record profits for BorgWarner. Over the long term, we intend to execute our growth strategy. And over the short term, remain focused on efficiency, regardless of the direction of the market.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ken.","Ken Lamb","Thanks, Ron. Now let's move to the Q&A portion of the call. Michelle, could you please reannounce the Q&A procedure?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","James, could you discuss how backlog contribution's trending so far in the year relative to the $450 million of contribution you talked about last year? Just given we're 1 quarter into the year, and you have some schedules that probably are going out 8 or 12 weeks. Just -- I know that was bit of a headwind last year for you, I'm curious to see how that's tracking now?","James R. Verrier","Yes. Good morning, Rich. We took a look at that, and so far, as we've looked at the year, it's about on track to where we would be expected to be at. You make get a few programs that may move a little up, a little down. But in a general level, the overall amount in the quarter that we would have been looking for to keep it on track was pretty much in line. And as we look out, we still feel pretty comfortable about how the backlog is tracking thus far. But to your point with the quarter behind us, it was good to say and pretty much confirm what we would want to say, Rich.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So the weaker mix was in line with expectation, the weaker mix in Europe?","James R. Verrier","Yes, it was. And if you remember when we did it -- last year when we set the backlog back in November, one of the things that we talked through and bridged from the prior view was there would be some mix adjustments, as well as the overall market conditions, that's what we talked about, I think, last November. And it's pretty much what we saw come through and play out in the first quarter. So on track, Rich, is kind of where we see it so far.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, Ron, could you address Drivetrain. You kind of alluded to trying to improve margins there from the current level. And what -- are there any actions that you're taking that are going to be noticeable to us or what other productivity measures are you doing to get the margins increasing from here?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Well, I'd say, Rich, right now, we had a target of 9% and we're there. But when we look at the business -- we just want to be more focused in the fact that we feel we could probably get better performance out of that segment. And I would just leave it that James and I have been spending a lot of time focusing in that segment of late. That's why I made a comment in my remarks. We are not 100% pleased, I guess. We're going to spend more focus in that area.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then the last one for me on -- would this reload of the share repurchases seemed like any chance of a dividend's off the table, at least at this juncture, is that a fair statement?","James R. Verrier","I wouldn't draw that conclusion, Rich. Is probably the way I would phrase it. I think the way I would look at it is, our CapEx spend is very consistent with what we've typically done over time. I think this share authorization is somewhat typical of what we've done, and so I think we're continuing on that. And what we've said over the recent months is we continue to, very openly, look at a dividend. So I wouldn't conclude, Rich, based on the today's news on the share repurchase that the dividend is off the table that remains very much on the table for discussion within the company, very much so.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Can you give us a little more detail on this program termination? What product was it? Which region? What caused that to happen? And did that come out of your backlog?","James R. Verrier","Yes, Ravi, this is James. The issue with the agreement is we've signed some confidentiality agreements, both with our supply base and with our customers. It doesn't allow us to share any detail around the program itself. So unfortunately, I can't offer color on that. I will say, it was not in the backlog. I can confirm that it was not in the backlog. But the details, Ravi, in terms of program, region, group, segment, I'm just not allowed to do that. So...","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's totally fair. Also, very pleased to see the margin you delivered in this quarter, despite the year being down so much and also above your full year guidance. I think most people expect macro and conditions to basically improve from here. So any reason why you shouldn't be topping these margins in the remaining quarters?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Ravi, all I'm going to say is that our guidance at 11.5%, or better, and we achieved over that in the first quarter. And we kept our guidance intact on the top line and the margin line. And I think our perspective from this point is that guidance is appropriate.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And just finally, Volkswagen had this recall in China with the DCT program, which I think you are on. I think you'd said at the time that it didn't affect you. Any update there regarding that program?","James R. Verrier","Yes, just to clarify, Ravi, BorgWarner was not impacted by that. We were not on that particular program. What we talked about on the last call is we want to respect Volkswagen's perspective. It's really their issue, obviously, for them to comment on publicly. But we did want to clarify the technology they used on those applications is not BorgWarner product or BorgWarner technology, so we're not involved.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Right. Lastly, apologies if I missed this, but did you change any of your end market or FX assumptions for your guidance?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","No, we have not.","James R. Verrier","Ravi, the only -- from a light vehicle perspective, they were all the same region by region. The commercial vehicle globally stayed the same. We just had a little bit of a down -- a little bit of a lesser view on China. And we felt a bit more comfortable about the upside this year in Brazil. So those were little bit of nuances underneath the macro level. And then on light vehicle, it was the same as our prior guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from Itay Michaeli from Citigroup.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","First question just on the European production outlook for the year, it looks like you've kept it down 3% year-over-year. If you talk about what gives you the comfort that, that still is the right level after a tough Q1? Maybe, James, talk about the visibility currently in the production schedules in Europe?","James R. Verrier","Yes, Itay, it's a great question and we -- let me just talk a little bit about how the first quarter itself played out from our view. As the quarter started running, we -- it was pretty good and we felt, I'd say, incrementally more comfortable about our view of the market for the year in Europe on light vehicle. And as the quarter came to an end and we started turning into April, it was little less exciting, I'll put it that way. So as we look out, we look at schedules, which are pretty decent through at least 45 to 60 days, that gives us comfort of what we'd see. And we feel pretty comfortable with the 3% down. The only thing I would say is, could that get incrementally a little worse? We're always paying a lot of attention to that. Could it be 4% down? Could it be 5% down? I think those are possible. It's possible. And the only thing that -- I think I've said in the past, Itay, is if it drifts to 4% or it drifts to 5%, we're ready for it and we've got the levers necessary to pull, and we will, to deliver the type of financial performance that you've become accustomed to with global NSO. It's a long answer, Itay. It's still a little shaky. It's still not as settled as any of us would like it to be. But we feel as good as we can about the 3%, but we're always paying a lot of attention. It could be 4% or 5%. And if that happens, we're ready.","Ken Lamb","Itay, this is Ken. I'm going to make the answer that's a little bit long and make it a little bit longer, and talk about some of the numbers. We looked at this and -- if you take Q1 and multiply it by 4 and then adjust Q3 for normal seasonality, that still gets you down someplace between 3% and 4%. So we're not actually looking for or expecting a recovery in Europe in the second half and we still feel comfortable with our guidance despite that.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's very reassuring. And then James, can you talk about the booking activity in the quarter? Are you pleased with the request for proposals and just the overall level of bookings for some of your programs?","James R. Verrier","Yes. It was -- in a nutshell, Itay, it was good. It was a strong quarter for us in terms of booking. And I would say pretty much in line with our historical performance, both in the ratio of the programs we won and we didn't win and from a dollars[ph] point of view. It was another, another solid, solid, solid quarter for us in terms of the booking. It was good.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And then just a quick last question for Ron. CapEx $87 million, a little bit lighter than we thought. Is it fair to say you're running, perhaps, at the lower end of the $450 million to $500 million full year range or is that just sort of a timing issue?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","No. I would say at this point, it's a timing issue, Itay. And also, I mentioned in there it had a little bit of currency that brought that number down, that's exaggerated it as well. So you can't take it for the face value. We probably were actually a little bit above last year. And then at the rate -- and at the run rate from that point, I would say, that seasonality being a little bit low in the first quarter, which you typically see.","Operator","Next question comes from John Murphy from Bank of America.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a first question on Europe, to follow-up on sort of the downside risk here. Can you remind us what percent of your workforce in Europe are temp workers now? And maybe sort of benchmark that against year end 2012 and beginning of 2012 levels?","James R. Verrier","Yes. Yes, I can, John. If you think of this as European direct workforce -- and I'll talk to you about the percentage of those workers that were temporary versus not temporary. If I go back about a year ago, so early part of 2012, to your point, we were running probably mid-20s percentage of direct worker -- temps. As we went through the year, we ended up roughly around 15-ish percent as we closed out 2013. And where we're sitting right now is a little north of that. So we're somewhere between 15% and 20% of our workers in Europe, direct to temps. And part of that is that move from the end of the year to where we are is, sequentially, our sales went up from 4 to 1 and we did that by adding more temporary workers as we did that. So it kind of gets to the point earlier, we feel good about the flexibility that we've got if there is a little bit of drift down beyond where we are in Europe.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So the cushion right now is probably is at least as big as where it was or about the same level as it was in the beginning of 2012 for temp workers?","James R. Verrier","A little less, John. A little less. But still healthy in our view. That 15% to 20% range is good for us.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Then second question, just to follow-up. I understand you can't disclose where the product termination was and any details around it. But how often do you run into that kind of an issue? It sounds like it's fairly unique and not something I've really heard a lot about in the past. Just curious how often something like that happens?","James R. Verrier","It's pretty unusual, for us, John. And certainly of this magnitude, it's very unusual for us. So, yes, it's unusual, especially at this size.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, Ron, just to follow up on this dividend question and to beat a dead horse a little bit here. What's the trigger that you're waiting for? I mean, right now you guys are incredibly well capitalized, your full year numbers look like they're coming through pretty well, you got cushion on the downside in Europe. What do you guys waiting for on getting this dividend out there? I mean, do you have to be at 0x net debt-to-EBITDA? Or -- I mean, what's the trigger?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","0 is not the trigger.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, but what is?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","No. There's-- if you recall some time ago, we were discussing things about repatriation activities. And we spent a lot of work in the last 9 months about doing a repatriation activity of sustaining that dividend. Remember, this gets in the discussion of where cash is generated. And I've mentioned in the past that 75% of our sales are offshore. You could probably make the logical conclusion that 75% of my cash is offshore. I got to make sure working with the tax people. We have a tax efficient structure to repatriate it back into the United States. And I will say, we've done a lot of work in that area. So that's one triggering event. Also, I just -- right in the process of going through some management changes, James is the new CEO, we have a new chairman that was appointed yesterday. And the transition -- a lot of people are asking more questions about dividends and we have to go through management change as well. So I'd say those are the 2 major events right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Ceraso from Credit Suisse.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","One follow-up item and then a couple of others about the backlog that came on. Do you have a rough number for us about how much new business came on in the quarter? Was it in the $75 million to $100 million range?","Ken Lamb","Chris, this is Ken. We don't have a specific number for you. But as you know, the backlog is probably a little bit weighted towards the second half of the year. We've talked about that before. And generally the comment is that it's on track for what our expectations are.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. The -- and again, to come back to something you've talk about. But just -- what's your view on where inventories in Europe are now? And to the extent that Europe output was little better in Q1, are you baking in, perhaps, a little bit weaker in the back half?","James R. Verrier","I think, Chris, inventory visibility is a challenge for all of us, especially in Europe specifically. It's just a lot less visible than so many places like the U.S. So there's a little bit of guesswork there. I would go back to the point that Ken and I discussed earlier, though, and I think this is pretty key for us. We're not planning on -- we weren't planning on a big uptick in the second half of the year indicating a significant recovery in Europe. We see -- when we compare the first half to the second half, there's not much of an adjustment at all at a market level. So I think that's the important thing. What we do in absence of the inventory lack of visibility, to put it that way, Chris, is we really focus heavily on our schedules. And as I said earlier, they're holding up pretty robustly, in line with what we thought as we've started into the second quarter, and what we saw in the first quarter.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then -- just the last item -- again, a topic that you've touched on. But the debt to capital in the 13s was below the low end of your range, should we read that you -- you do have an appetite to add some leverage to put capital to work whether through more buybacks or acquisitions or to grow the business?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Well, Chris, we came out with a range guidance coming into the year here just recently. And I would say, yes, I would be -- that's what my target range is, to get in the north of 15% in that range. And I'm close, I got to 13.8%, but yet that's my intent, to get to that range.","Operator","Your next question comes from the Brett Hoselton from KeyBanc.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just to kind of a wrap-up the capital deployment questions. Is this a 1-month, 1-quarter, 1-year, 1-decade timing wise? What are your thoughts there? Is this something you think you might wrap up shortly or is this something that you're -- that's going to take some time to kind of work your way through it?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Brett, could you clarify?","Ken Lamb","Yes. Is that the dividend?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Right.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Well, whether it be dividend or share repurchase just capital deployment in general?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Oh. The way I view this, Brett, is we didn't have an M&A transaction 2012. And as a result, cash started to build up. And we had to become very assertive in our capital structure and we started on that process probably, what, last year I bought 4 million shares, I was very active in the fourth quarter. We gave now a range of leverage that we're comfortable with. And I would say, this is just a process we're going through that -- to convey to you where we like to be. And we're migrating toward that target right now. In the first quarter, we purchased some shares. And all I'm saying is that we have to be more assertive when the M&A activity transactions don't come as timely as we would like.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Well, I understand that. I guess, what I'm wondering is, you obviously have a very healthy balance sheet at this point in time. You're forecasting maybe $500 million of free cash flow and a $50 million repurchase rate, that's $200 million. So basically, you're going to build about $300 million in cash this year, which is a pretty healthy increase. And it seems like your balance sheet has plenty of capacity to make an acquisition. So I'm kind of wondering if it's fair to anticipate some sort of a step up in capital deployment within the next 2 to 3 quarters? Or is this something that, look, it may take another 1 or 2 years to work this issue or that issue?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Okay. I see where you're at now, Brett, on this. I wouldn't indicate the first quarter as the full year run rate on my repurchases, first of all, right? Because I was very aggressive in the fourth and there's some administrative issues, quite frankly, in the first as far as blackout periods that prevents me to be as active as I could have been. That's one issue. So I wouldn't think that's an indication of where I'm going forward. Two, the M&A pipeline comes into view as well, right? So I have to basically look at the M&A activity that could change all of the economics and the ratios, quite frankly, with a -- say a $200 million, $300 million M&A activity at a given quarter. So I got to look at the future as far as what's coming on M&A versus the share repurchase events I do get in the quarter. So I'm looking at quite a few things right now moving forward.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then just -- as you think about -- you obviously had very good first quarter, better than we expected, better than the Street expected. It seems like you would generally feel a little bit better about your full year guidance. Would you consider yourself to -- I guess my question is simply, why would you not bump your guidance up?  Is it just kind of, \"Look, we want to be conservative because we're concerned about Europe and we just don't know and there's some uncertainty and little earlier in the game?\" Or is there something else that you see deteriorating as you move through the remainder of the year specifically?","James R. Verrier","Brett, this is James. I think -- I'll say it this way. After a really solid first quarter, as you point out, just -- it really helps. When you actually get over that 11.5% out of the shoot in your first quarter, it's a really -- it's a good feeling in terms of how you feel about the rest of the year. I think just some of the uncertainty that is still out there in Europe, it's pretty significant. I mean, that's still 40-plus percent of our business. The commercial vehicle space continues to be a little bit volatile. Those are kind of the 2 things that cause us to just keep monitoring. I would tell you it's less on the operating side. I have a lot of confidence in the[indiscernible] and I think we've showed that in the first quarter. So it's not an executions issue at all. I feel very good about our operational proficiency and our performance. It's more just the uncertainty that overhangs in Europe, light vehicle and commercial vehicle that just -- we kind of want to get another quarter behind us to see how that plays out before we would feel more comfortable. If that make sense to you.","Operator","And comes from Colin Langan from UBS.","Rahul Chadha - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","This is Rahul Chadha for Colin Langan. Just wanted to -- a follow-up on Chris' question from earlier. Could you provide some granularity into the inventory situation in Europe? How is the inventory looking at the luxury OEMs versus mass market? And how does that translate into your mix outlook for the rest of the year?","James R. Verrier","I think as I was talking about earlier, the specific inventory levels in Europe are just really -- we don't have that visibility. So again, we focus more on the schedules. I would say, from a BorgWarner point of view, the mix projections that we see, predominately with the luxury vehicles and the higher-ended contented[ph] vehicles, is playing out about what we expected it to be. And maybe I could just add a little bit of color on that. If you go back to the first quarter of 2012, that segment was performing extremely well. As the year played out, particularly in the third and fourth quarters, we sort of pulled back somewhat on the luxury segment, which caught up with the lower-ended contented[ph] vehicles. And the way we're running now and the way we're expecting it to run is for that mix to continue more in line with the second half of 2012. And that's about what we're seeing right now in the first quarter and as we look out to our schedules into the second quarter.","Rahul Chadha - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. In terms of the diesel mix, what's your outlook on that for the year?","James R. Verrier","It's pretty much stable in that 53% type range for diesel in Europe. So no, no meaningful adjustment there.","Rahul Chadha - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And just one last question. Ford and GM are -- could be moving to a 9- or 10-speed transmission. Is that a positive trend for the traditional clutch business?","James R. Verrier","Yes. Yes, it is. They are definitely moving in that direction collaboratively, as you all know, with that 9- and 10-speed architecture. And BorgWarner is an integral part of working with both Ford and GM on utilizing some of our new technologies to help bring those transmission to the market. So directionally, it's a good move for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan.","Ryan Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. But just one on turbocharger take rates. We continue to hear a lot about rising turbocharger penetration on light vehicles here in the United States as they proliferate into gasoline powered vehicles. But can you maybe talk a little bit about the trend that you see in turbocharger take rates in various different other regions around the world?","James R. Verrier","Yes, we see a continued adoption rate. I think we've talked about this where, today, the global number of engines that are turbocharged is around 30% of the world, and that will climb up in the next 5 to 6 years to about a 40% adoption rate. And a lot of that is driven by a couple of things, really. One is, increased turbocharged gasoline engines and that's a global phenomenon. But geographically, the 2 areas that are seeing and getting the biggest growth rates are North America and China. That's where there's particular very high penetration rates over the next 5 to 6 years that get you from the 30% to the 40% penetration growth rate[ph].","Ryan Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then just on Europe, on your book of business over there. Sometimes, the registration data we get is more timely than the production data that we get out of that continent. Can you just kind of update on the latest trends and the automakers that are disproportionately exposed to over there for example, some of the German customers, did they continue to do better than the market overall?","James R. Verrier","I think if I got it right, Ryan, you're just asking for kind of outlook view on production volumes? Is that...","Ryan Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just the latest trend in your largest customer's production rates?","James R. Verrier","Okay. Yes. I mean, we're seeing -- what we're seeing from majority of the customers are the schedules are holding up about what we anticipated both in terms of actual volumes and then mix of product. So we're not seeing any meaningful change out of them and its holding up pretty well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Spak from RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Ron, you mentioned earlier about keeping options open for the M&A pipeline. Maybe you or James can just give a little bit more texture about what you're seeing there, whether stuff seems to be loosening up a little bit? And also, potential multiples?","James R. Verrier","Yes. I would say a couple of things, Joe. The intensity and the processing side of the company is in not letting up at all. We're still very pushing that process robustly. We do have a few targets that we're engaged in discussions with, I'll put it that way, that are very -- of high interest to us. So we've got a number of those moving forward. I think you know typically the companies that we're looking for are company's not for sale, they're family owned. So that process is a little bit hard to predict how it would play out in terms of closing a deal or getting the deal over the line. But I would tell you, the intensity's high. The number of targets in play is significant for us. And we're doing all we can, Joe, to bring one of these targets home as quickly as we can.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And would the focus be more on technologies that could help near-term -- or sort of next-generation technology that may take a little bit to develop, that might come a little bit cheaper, but could be home runs down the road?","James R. Verrier","The real quick answer is both, Joe. We very much look at products of technologies that we can bring into the companies that are already in place, so to speak, that we can bolt on and go running with those. So examples of those would typically be the Haldex deal, the ENSA deal that we've done in recent years, and then the Etatech technologies, a good example of the other part of the profile, which is a technology that's yet to be fully developed and brought to the market. So both. Both is where we're looking, Joe.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then you've mentioned the weaker yen as a reason why, as an offset to maybe the stronger euro. Just out of curiosity, with the NSK-Warner JV, competitive wise -- are most of your competitors also based over in Japan, so there's no sort of competitive advantage there for you? Or is that -- with that relatively cheaper, is that a potential advantage for you?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","The way I would answer that, Joe, is obviously, NSK-Warner ships -- I mean, they're shipping to Toyota and to the extent that Toyota can get a benefit of cheaper yen, we'd see more volume going through the joint venture, right? So everyone's been talking about how Toyota's going to respond with a lower yen. We would get volume increases through there.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Great. And one quick one. I realize there's a ton of moving parts. But broad strokes, is it fair to say that when you talk about Europe down 3% production year-over-year, does that more or less correlate to the midpoint of your guidance?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Yes, more or less, I would say, to the mid-point. Yes.","Operator","We have time for one final question and that question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes. I don't think we've discussed kind of your relative outperformance in Asia. Just a couple things. Kind of given your selective participation in Japan, how did those production trends stay out? And do you know your -- if you look at Japan versus China, what your growth there was relative to production in each of those markets? And then the second is kind of what's behind that? And then third would be, with the yen now broaching 100, are you seeing more signs of life out of the Mitsubishi turbos, the[indiscernible], Sekos and other Japanese powertrain vendors?","James R. Verrier","There's a lot of questions there, Brian, but let me talk, first about Asia in itself. We saw a very good -- we have a Japanese facility that had extremely good volume year-over-year in the first quarter. That's where we saw a lot of good growth in Asia came out of Japan. China's been a good market for us. Korea wasn't as good in Asia as we've seen in the past, maybe the holiday season, not quite sure. But the majority of that growth came out of a Japan facility and China, which has been an ongoing story for us for some time. Now you had a bunch of other questions on data, but quite frankly, if you wouldn't mind, I -- we're still going through all those numbers, maybe we can get with you later on some on these, Brian, okay?","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Well, I guess then -- speaking of Japan, with the yen at 100, are you seeing any different competitive profile coming out of the Japanese domicile powertrain vendors?","James R. Verrier","Not significantly, Brian. I - the only trend that I think is pretty meaningful is -- you do see a trend to more localization efforts. And I think that's not driven purely by the yen movement, that's the result of some of the natural disasters that were suffered there. So I think that's a been playing out over the last year or so where we're seeing, particularly in North America, the Japanese OEMs looking to increase local content and I think that's playing out. And that's a meaningful move that we talked about in prior calls, that potentially creates opportunity for BorgWarner.","Ken Lamb","I'd like to thank you all for joining us.

It's posted on our website, borgwarner.com, on our Investor Relations homepage. A replay of today's conference call will be available through November 6 also on our website.

Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today. Now moving on to our results. James Verrier, President and CEO, will highlight our quarterly operating results as well as some of our recent noteworthy accomplishments. And then Ron Hundzinski, our CFO, will discuss the details of our quarterly operating results and also our updated outlook for 2014. With that, I'll turn it over to James.","James R. Verrier","Thank you, Ken, and good day, everybody. Ron and I are very pleased today to be reviewing our third quarter results as well as some of our recent accomplishments. But before I get into the details, let me just take a moment to thank all of our BorgWarner employees around the world for delivering yet another outstanding quarter for the company.","So on to the results. So for the third quarter, reported sales were just over $2 billion, which is up 13% from a year ago or 8% when we exclude the impact of foreign currencies and the Wahler acquisition. U.S. GAAP earnings were $0.73 per share or $0.79 per share excluding nonrecurring charges. Our operating income margin, again, excluding nonrecurring charges, was an impressive 12.5% in the quarter. Two key factors that drove our strong results: solid sales growth and operational efficiency in the Engine segment and good cost controls across the corporation. So outstanding performance again by our operations.","Let me talk a little bit about the 2 segments. First, in the Engine segment, third quarter sales were $1.4 billion, which is up 17% from a year ago or 10% after excluding the impact of foreign currencies and Wahler. Those results were led by strong turbocharger sales in Europe, China and Korea and new VCT launches in China. I'll switch over to the Drivetrain segment where sales were approximately $630 million, which is up 4% from a year ago or 3% when we exclude foreign currencies. Drivetrain's sales growth is driven by high dual-clutch transmission volumes in Europe, but this was partially offset by a planned slow ramp-up of a major program by a North American customer. Drivetrain continues to grow and our restructuring plan is on track. In July, we began moving equipment from our Western European operations to Poland. And we've said that before that the equipment moves may cause some inefficiencies in the business, which we saw a little of in the third quarter. However, these actions which will enhance Drivetrain's competitive position are critically important to the long-term success of the business.","The segment review highlights BorgWarner's core strengths, a product portfolio in high-demand in markets around the world, strong operational performance from the Engine segment and very good execution of the Drivetrain restructuring plan designed to improve long-term performance. Our financial strength and strong performance is based on our ability to anticipate and drive the next technology waves. As we look to the future, BorgWarner continues to invest for the long term. Capital spending continues to grow. We spent about 7% of sales on capital in the third quarter, which is slightly above our target of 6%, and we remain committed to supporting our future growth and productivity improvements. Our investment in R&D was just over 4% of sales in the quarter, which is in line with our target for the year. And the intensity around organic innovation and product development remains very strong.","I'm also proud to share some exciting announcements we made during the quarter. First of all, BorgWarner supplies its mini direct-acting variable force solenoid for General Motors global front-wheel-drive 6-speed automatic transmission program. Featured in the range of 2015 Chevy, Buick and GMC vehicles, BorgWarner's solenoid enables improved fuel economy and shift feel and applications exist in every major global market including the Americas, Europe, China and South Korea.","Last month, we officially opened our second turbocharger production facility in China, the new green facility is strategically located in the city of Taicang, a major development area close to Shanghai, and the facility will produce advanced turbocharging technologies for several automakers. Our production facility in Ningbo, China has produced more than $1.5 million exhaust gas recirculation valves or EGR valves for both passenger cars and commercial diesel vehicles. EGR helps reduce emissions and improve fuel economy. And the plant has been supplying our customers in China with EGR valves since 2010 and also EGR coolers and modules since 2013. BorgWarner expects to produce about 1 million EGR valves annually in Ningbo beginning in 2016.","Also, BorgWarner supplies its high-performance wet friction technology for Volkswagen's new hybrid DQ 400e dual-clutch transmission launching in the 2014 Volkswagen Golf and the Audi's A3 e-tron. The transmission hybrid vehicles employs 3 clutches, the dual-clutch module plus a disconnecting clutch to smoothly connect and disconnect the electric engine from the drivetrain. For all 3 clutches, BorgWarner's leading wet friction technology improves shift performance, NVH and fuel economy.","BorgWarner's production facility and engineering center in Itatiba City, Brazil recently received Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, also known as the LEED certification. This achievement is a first for an automotive supplier in Brazil, and LEED certification affirms sustainable building strategies and practice. Our environmentally friendly Brazilian campus was specifically designed and built to fulfill the demanding requirements for this LEED certification, and it's one of several BorgWarner facilities around the globe to achieve this prestigious certification.","Now let me take a moment to provide an overview of our revised guidance for 2014. Sales growth in 2014 is expected to be 12% to 13%, which is down a little from our previous guidance range of 13% to 15%. This change is due to weaker foreign currencies. So as a result of the lower sales guidance, we're trimming our earnings guidance to a range of $3.23 to $3.28 per diluted share, and the range excludes noncomparable items. Our operating margin is still expected to approach 13%. Our operations have performed at a very high level for the past several quarters, and we expect that to continue. I recognize this is only a high-level overview of our updated guidance, and Ron will take you through the details shortly.","So the first 3 quarters of the year were very strong for BorgWarner, and as we look ahead to the remainder of the year and beyond, our expectations for the company are unchanged. We're expecting industry-leading revenue growth and continued excellence from our operation, and that combination will result in tremendous earnings power for our company. The industry's adoption of our leading-edge powertrain technology will continue for years, and I feel very, very good of our company's future, and I see no company in the auto sector better-positioned for long-term profitable growth than BorgWarner. So now with that, let me turn the call over to Ron.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Thanks, James, and good day, everyone. Before I begin reviewing the financials, I also would like to commend all of our employees for their hard work and congratulate them on another solid quarter. So now, on to our financials. James already provided a detailed review of our sales performance in the quarter. In summary, sales were up 13% from a year ago or 8%, excluding the impact of foreign currencies and the Wahler acquisition. The growth in the quarter came primarily from the Engine segment, while the Drivetrain segment had a tough year-over-year comparison. I'll talk more about that later. Overall, it was a strong -- another strong quarter for our sales.","Working down the income statement, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 20.9% in the quarter, down 10 basis points from a year ago. During the same period, SG&A as a percentage of sales was 8.6%, down 10 basis points. R&D spending, which is included in SG&A, was up 20 basis points. This implies a 30-basis-point improvement in other SG&A spending. Reported operating income in the quarter was $238 million. However, this includes nonrecurring items related to restructuring activities and a pension plan settlement. The $13 million restructuring charge includes expenses related to the continued relocation of 2 drivetrain facilities from Western to Eastern Europe, the continuing investment in improving Wahler's operational efficiency and footprint, and a global legal entity realignment plan and tentative enhanced [ph] treasury management flexibility. The $3 million pension plan settlement is related to a lump sum payment made to former employees to discharge our obligation under the plan.","Excluding nonrecurring items, operating income was $254 million or 12.5% of sales, flat with the same period a year ago. However, if you exclude the Wahler acquisition, operating margin would have been 13.2% of sales or 70 basis points better, a strong performance concerning the restructuring-related inefficiencies -- efficiencies that we were working through. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, the Wahler acquisition and nonrecurring items, our year-over-year incremental margin was 22%, above our mid-teens incremental margin target. This is the sixth straight quarter in which we have surpassed our target. As you look further down the income statement, equity and affiliate earnings were $15 million in the quarter, up from $10 million last year. This represents the performance of NSK-Warner, our 50-50 joint venture in Japan, which sells transmission components to our Japanese customers in China and Japan, as well as TEL, our turbocharger joint venture in India.","Interest expense and finance charges were $9 million in the quarter, up slightly from a year ago. Provision for income taxes in the quarter on a reported basis were $72 million. However, this included a tax benefit of $2 million related to the restructuring and pension settlement charges. Excluding the impact of the nonrecurring items, provision for income taxes was about $74 million, which is an effective tax rate of about 28.5% in the quarter. Our estimated effective tax rate for the full year, excluding noncomparable items, remains at 28.5%. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest was $6 million in the quarter, basically flat with the third quarter 2013. This line item reflects our minority partner's share in earnings performance of our Korean and Chinese consolidated joint ventures. That brings us back to net earnings, which were $167 million in the quarter or $0.73 per share. Excluding the impact of nonrecurring items, net earnings were $0.79 per share, up 13% from $0.70 per share a year ago, outstanding performance for the company.","Now let's take a closer look at operating segments in the quarter. As James said earlier, reported Engine segment sales were $1.4 billion in the quarter. Excluding currency and Wahler, Engine segment organic sales growth was 10% compared with the same period a year ago. On a reported basis, adjusted EBIT for the Engine segment was 15.8% of sales. Excluding currency and Wahler, adjusted EBIT for the Engine segment was 17% of sales, up 80 basis points from 16.2% reported a year ago. Excluding currency and Wahler, the Engine segment's year-over-year incremental margin was 26% in the third quarter, very good performance by the Engine segment. Restructuring plan for Wahler is on target. The remaining charges will be recorded over the next 2 years or so, after which Wahler is expected to be a double-digit margin business.","So now the Drivetrain segment. Reported sales were about $630 million in the quarter. Excluding currency, organic sales growth was just over 3% compared with the same period a year ago. As I said earlier, Drivetrain faced a tough year-over-year comparison. The third quarter 2013 was the beginning of a surge in all-wheel drive sales in North America and dual-clutch module sales in Europe for the company. Third quarter 2014 is the anniversary of that surge in growth, making it a tough comparison. Also, in the third quarter of 2014, Drivetrain was impacted by a planned slow ramp-up of a major program by a North American customer.","On a reported basis, adjusted EBIT was 10.8% of sales. Excluding currency, adjusted EBIT was 10.7% of sales, down slightly from 10.9% of sales a year ago. Excluding currency, the Drivetrain segment's year-over-year incremental margin was about 5% in the third quarter. So let's keep this in perspective. Drivetrain delivered $1 million of incremental adjusted EBIT on $20 million of incremental sales. That means the segment was only $2 million to $3 million shy of a 15% to 20% incremental margin, which can be attributed to costs associated with our new DCT component plant in Taicang, China that has not yet launched production and the restructuring challenges faced in the quarter. The Drivetrain restructuring plan is also on target with regard to both timing and cost. We still expect to have the relocations completed by the end of 2015, after which, Drivetrain would be in a much better competitive position in Europe.","Now let's take a look at our balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $546 million of net cash from operating activities in the first 9 months of 2014, up from $514 million a year ago. The increase was primarily related to higher net earnings. Capital spending was $398 million in the first 9 months of 2014, up $100 million from a year ago. The increase was driven by capital required to support our backlog of net new business. Free cash flow, which was defined -- which we defined as net cash from operating activities less capital spending, was $146 million in the first 9 months of 2014, down from $216 million during the same period last year primarily due to higher capital spending. Looking at the balance sheet itself, balance sheet debt increased by $89 million at the end of the third quarter compared with the end of 2013. Cash decreased by $157 million during the same period. The $246 million increase in net debt was primarily due to dividend payments to shareholders, share repurchases and the Wahler acquisition. Our net debt to capital ratio is 12.2%, up from 7.2% at the end of 2013. Net debt-to-EBITDA at the end of the year on a trailing 12-month basis was 0.4x. Our capital structure remains in excellent shape.","Now I'd like to discuss our guidance for 2014. James reviewed our guidance at a high level. I'll discuss some of the finer points. As James said, the decrease in our sales guidance is due to weakening foreign currencies, mainly the euro. We've taken our full year forecast for the euro down from $1.35 to the euro to approximately $1.33 to the euro. Our sales and margin guidance implies a mid-teen incremental margin in the fourth quarter on a comparable basis. While this is in line with our long-term target, we do not concede that this is at the end of our above-target performance. We think this is more a function of our near-term environment spending for our new DCT component plant in China and restructuring-related efficiencies.","Finally, our expected diluted share count for 2014 is now 229 million, down from approximately 230 million shares primarily related to share repurchase executed today. We continue to be very confident in our ability to execute in any market. This company has demonstrated a heightened focus on efficiency and cost. This focus resulted in a highly efficient growth and record margins in each of the last 4 years. With return to historical growth rates and operations performing at a very high level, 2014 should be another record of sales and profits for BorgWarner. So as we look beyond 2014, we intend to execute our growth plan yielding high single to low double-digit growth and to efficiently convert our sales growth to profits. The future is bright for BorgWarner. So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ken.","Kenneth Lamb","Thanks, Ron. Now let's move to the Q&A portion of the call. Kyle, can you please remind everyone of the Q&A procedure?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo Securities.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Ron, on the comment about Drivetrain with mid-teens incremental margins, is that exclusive of the restructuring inefficiencies? So should we assume a lower rate for Q4 because of ongoing inefficiencies from the restructuring?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Rich, mid-teens is our target exclusive of restructuring. Am I saying that right? However, the restructuring inefficiency is included in that mid-teens incremental target.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, alright. I just wanted to clarify that. And then on the currency assumption, that 1 33 is the average for the year, not for the quarter, correct?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","That's correct. I knew Rich was wanting to talk about currency for a second. You're absolutely correct. The spot rate is about 1 26, 1 27. BorgWarner uses an average. So the 1 33 is the average that would be -- we're anticipating for the full year if the spot rate remains in this 1 26, 1 27 range.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Alright. And then on commercial, off-road has been weak here recently. Could you just remind us your exposure both -- to that end market both from a regional standpoint as well as an end market, whether it's ag, construction, et cetera?","James R. Verrier","Yes, Richard, this is James. Roughly about 15% thereabouts of our annual revenue is commercial vehicle. And that's pretty well split relatively equally between on-road and off-road. And from a geographical perspective, the 4 markets primarily we serve are Europe and North America, which are the 2 bigger markets for us, and then we also serve Brazil and China. And our view, Rich, is those markets, with the exception of North America, remain kind of weak, particularly obviously in South America. So if that helps you out, that's a general thing. And then the last comment, Rich, just from a product perspective, the 3 primary products that we serve our market with are turbo and fan drives business in the thermal part of the company and our emissions products, both valves and coolers [ph]. So hope that's gives you hopefully a bit of a summary.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","On the North America piece, are you -- others have talked about some weakness here lately. You're not seeing that in your book of business, off-road specifically?","James R. Verrier","Not significantly. Not enough to move us significantly, Rich. No.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton from KeyBanc.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I apologize. I guess, I'm kind of -- I'm trying to think -- I'm thinking about the fourth quarter, and I'm thinking about contribution margins. And my simple back of the envelope math leads me to a 6% contribution margin in the fourth quarter. And I'm kind of thinking 12.2% operating margins and $2,050,000,000 in sales, or something along those lines. I'm thinking that seems a lot different than mid-teens. I know that you just kind of addressed that to some extent. But I guess I'm still somewhat confused. Is my math completely incorrect? Feel free to say that. Or is there some headwinds I need to account for that caused that differential.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Brett, are you doing a fourth quarter year-over-year comparison?","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","So have you taken into consideration the Wahler impact on us?","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","No, I'm just saying all-in total company, you're at 6%, so I guess Wahler would be one of the major differentials there.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Right, right. Well, no. In the quarter, Wahler on the total company was about 70 basis points impact. On the full -- and I think I gave the color around the actual segment, so it's a significant margin impact if you do the math. Go back through the transcript and you'll see the magnitude of that I gave you.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Yes, okay. I guess, and then, let me ask you about just capital deployment, just switching gears here. As we think about capital deployment, it sounds like you're moving toward a more deliberate approach towards capital deployment, particularly share repurchase. I'm wondering, how should we think about the pace of share repurchase as we move through 2015?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Okay. Brett, so, let me just talk about total capital deployment. I think we have a very balanced approach right now, is what you're seeing. You're seeing CapEx is up, so we're funding the CapEx. We put in a dividend, so the dividend payments are in there, then the share repurchases. And then you go take into consideration M&A activity, right? So I would take a look at M&A and share repurchases together. And I think we've said in the past, in the absence of M&A activity, we would fill that gap with share repurchases. So to answer your question, in '15, I think, one of the question needs to be the M&A activity consideration, right? In absence of, we would move to share repurchases. If we had M&A activity, we would focus on M&A activity.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And that makes sense. I guess what I'm asking here is, if my calculations are correct, if I use your leverage targets, your debt-to-capital targets, I've got about $1 billion of buying power out there, and that's a lot. And so it seems like your incremental capital free cash flow might be available towards share repurchase, and we might be able to think about modeling maybe a more consistent level of share repurchase activity than we've seen over the past 8 quarters. And I guess I'm wondering, is that the direction we're moving? And if so, is there a dollar amount that you'd recommend or would you just, \"Look, I wouldn't model anything for now. Just hold off and it'll all be incremental upside.\"","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Brett, the unknowns here are the size of the M&A activities, right? And what I mean by that is, if you have an M&A activity that's pushing $500 million, $600 million, that changes that discussion because that would give us in a leverage range quicker. So I would say this though. Share repurchases are part of our deployment of capital. That's the bottom line. We're not going to give guidance at this point as far as what value that is because it's predicated on an M&A strategy, and when transactions in M&A actually happen.","Kenneth Lamb","And Brett, this is Ken. I want to add to what Ron just said. He mentioned in his prepared remarks about the global realignment plan to increase our treasury management flexibility. And a part of that flexibility is around using cash for various things including share repurchases. That's the plan we've been talking about for the last several months. It is underway. We expect to have that in place no later than the beginning of 2016. And I think that there can be some more consistency in our share repurchases at that time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's Rob Lache here. So a couple of questions. First is, could you maybe help us with a couple things on the organic growth in the fourth quarter? You may be -- just first of all, what is the FX impact that you're expecting in terms of dollars. Is it around $75 million for Q4?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Relative to what, Rod? To...","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Prior year -- no, no the year-over-year effect. We're just trying to back into what you're achieving.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","That's correct. You're in the range, yes.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So if you use the midpoint of your guidance range, revenue growth is around $170 million. Add back the $75 million from FX, maybe subtract the $88 million from Wahler. So organic growth is maybe $157 million, $158 million, up around 8.5% from last year? You did 1.885 . Your production is a positive. Obviously, pricing is a little bit of a negative. So there was expected to be some uptick in your backlog to get to that $700 million full year backlog. I think that the uptick -- you'd have to do something like north of $200 million, maybe $250 million of backlog in the fourth quarter? Is there something that is meaningfully affecting that $700 million full year backlog? Is that the slow ramp-up from the customer. Can you maybe just elaborate on what are some of the components of the organic growth guidance for the fourth quarter?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","So I'm trying to keep up with your math. But essentially, our guidance, when we came into the year, organic sales growth was going to be between 7% and 11%. And as we do all the puts and takes that we just talked about, I think, that's exactly where we ended up landing. And that original guidance was based on our backlog of around $700 million this year. So last year, well, I'll just say that the impact that you talked about, they seem to be in the range. I'll have to maybe work with you offline to see if there's any other missing pieces, but that sounds right.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Were you expecting an uptick in the contribution from backlog in the fourth quarter relative to earlier in the year? And is that still the case?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","No, no. We, as you know, when we give our guidance for the year, even our backlog, it's kind of an annual look. I can't say that there's an expectation that there is going to be any strong lift in the fourth quarter versus the other quarters. And then let me reiterate, our guidance now is very well-aligned with what our guidance was in January, which was based on our backlog that we -- the announcement we made last November.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Could you talk a little bit about the timing of the drag from restructuring inefficiencies in Europe? How should we be thinking about some of the big moves that you're making and how that kind of flows through? And then, lastly, I don't know if you have any comments on this, but obviously, there's some reviews of testing procedures that's going on in Europe. One of which -- one of the changes being discussed is moving from this new European driving cycle to WLPT. Do you see that as having any puts and takes or puts or takes vis-a-vis the outlook for backlog or for mix for you?","James R. Verrier","Rob, this is James. I'll comment a little on the evolution of driving test cycles, et cetera. In a nutshell, we don't really expect any meaningful change in -- for us in terms of our product strategy, our growth expectations. We just -- we don't. I think there's always been this element of test cycles versus real world driving and there's always been some disparity. I think any move towards aligning those closer or aligning it consistently globally, around the world is a good thing. I don't believe there's anything materially that's going to adjust the automaker strategies around maybe fuel economy and emission standards. And so therefore, I think, our product plans will stay in place. So I don't think it's going to really make any much difference to BorgWarner, Rod, if that helps you. But in terms of the Drivetrain piece, let me just comment, if I can, just from a macro point rather. Then if Ron or Ken want to add detailed numbers, that's fine. First and foremost, the Drivetrain restructuring remains really important for us, and the reason it remains important for us is to support our growth plans for Drivetrain. It's an integral part of our growth strategy and we wanted to put ourself in a position where we can capitalize on that growth by an optimized footprint. Let's just -- it's a refresh. And the really good news, that plan stays on track where, as Ron alluded to, we're now in a phase of moving equipment and then going through all that stuff. What we've talked about, Rod, is that would meaningfully kick off in the middle of this year and it would run through most of next year until we're fully, fully done. And I think what we talked about -- that's staying on track. And what we talked about is, when we were running in the higher incremental lines earlier, in earlier quarters, in the 30s, we talked about a couple of headwinds and one of them was Drivetrain restructuring but our target and our goal is that would probably moderate us back to the mid-teens or maybe a little more than that. And I think, we feel good actually, that's kind of what we're seeing play out. So it's not a 1-quarter event, Rod. We'll see some noise in that over the next few quarters, but that's not going to take us through all our commitment to the mid-teens. And if it works out a little better than we hoped, it'd maybe take us a little north of the mid-teens. So does that help a little, Rod, give you some better understanding on it or...","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So just kind of at a high level, if you were to do 15% incremental in 2015, because this is, obviously, this is going to take a while before this is done, would 15% be in line or somewhat disappointing for you?","James R. Verrier","I would say, the mid-teens is our expectation, and we would look to hope to exceed that. I mean, that's typically the way we look at it, right? We don't manage the company to run at mid-teens. We're always looking to improve. And I think what I'm trying to characterize a little, Rod, is there's a lot of moving pieces when you do it over a 12- or 18-month period. So there's going to be noise, but we'll look to try and exceed that if we can. But I think, mid-teens is a reasonable minimum expectation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I'm sorry, I'm going to ask you another guidance question because I still can't make the math work. If I were to just take, just for ease of calculation, the high end of your guidance for revenues at 13% and your margin of approaching 13%, I get to an EPS number that's about $0.05 above the high end of your guidance range on EPS. I'm just kind of starting to figure it out, is there anything below the line that's hurting numbers? Or why that would be the case?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","No, there's nothing that would be a negative that -- we know we have restructuring at this point, and we're trying to work through what those restructuring impact of moving those facilities to Western Europe are. But that -- there's nothing really I can say that's a negative.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Maybe I'll follow-up with Ken post the call, but I think you're getting a number of these questions because I think people are just trying to make the math work. And I think your guidance change on revenues and margins makes a lot of sense. But it just seems like EPS is moving a lot more than that. And I think people want to figure out why. I'll follow up again post the call.","Kenneth Lamb","One comment, Ravi, just before you move on. Our -- the difference -- the main difference is that expectations may have been different than our guidance as of the last quarter, I think. But our -- we can work through that offline, but I have a math model here that supports this. So I'm sure we'll figure it out.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Understood, understood. Just on the slow ramp by that North American customer, can you just give more detail on who, what, why, how long it's going to last, or how much dollar impact that is on 3Q and going forward?","James R. Verrier","Ravi, I don't want to give too much specificity about which customer, but what I will say is, it's planned and it's in line with what we were kind of expected, and it's not a long-term thing. I think it'll be sorted by the fourth quarter and back to normal levels. So it's not a surprise or a shock. It's kind of about on track to what we were expecting actually, and we should be through it by the end of the year.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, you guys had hinted earlier in the year that you may be closing in on another acquisition before the end of the year. Any update on that?","James R. Verrier","The update probably, Ravi, is we continue to have a number of targets in the pipeline. And I think what has been typical over recent quarters, we've always got 1 or 2 that are kind of closer towards completion than others, and I think that's pretty much where we are right now. So we're working really very hard and very diligently to try and get one completed. I think you just know. It's just -- you can't predict that date just because of the uncertainty of the process itself. But the intensity is strong. The pipeline is very robust actually. And again, typically, we've got 1 or 2 that are kind of getting closer to completion and I think -- I would say that's where we're at right now, Ravi.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And I'm sorry, just one more. Just on the backlog and recently, you guys sounded fairly confident in talking about the backlog math. I think you've -- Ken even said that it's best macro environment in 2 years, doing [ph] the backlog math. And any update on that? I mean do you feel like things have deteriorated as you've done more math? Or what's your view going into a couple of weeks now?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","I think that if you visit us at November 10, you'll get the whole picture of what you're looking for, Ravi.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's very helpful.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","I know that it's not, but I have to defer till then. Sorry.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Spak from RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","First, maybe to just talk about the fourth quarter guidance in a different way. If you do the math on the FX impact, it does come to about -- down [ph] EPS level, $0.03. The low end of the range lowered by about that much but the high end was more like $0.07. So I'm just wondering what the delta is and what could really cause that larger discrepancy behind. Is it more cost? Is it some additional volume pressure?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","All right, Joe. So the first question, are you referring to the prior guidance number sequentially you're trying to do it or year-over-year? Because that's important too.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes. Well. I guess, what I'm doing is I'm looking at sort of your prior full year guidance range versus your new year guidance range.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Yes, alright, so I get about a little bit north of $100 million in sales reduction, okay? Now maybe the difference is the third quarter difference as well but I get $100 million. And typically, it's $0.12, $0.14 on the dollar that FX impact has on the operating income, then you have to flush it through the EPS. So I get more of a $0.05. I think, you're getting $0.03 a share, right?","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So just to be clear, I guess, I'm wondering, so if you look at just new versus old for the full year, the high end was lowered by much more than the low end. I'm just wondering what caused that discrepancy.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","We'd have to...","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","We could follow up later.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Joe, I get $0.05 at the midpoint, I will say that. Now, if it's $0.06 or $0.005 on the high end, low end, in the midpoint, it's roughly $0.05. And it's not just the euro, you have to take into consideration that there's strength against just about every major currency except the Korean won. So there's currencies involved. But top level, it's about 100-plus million. You can always use this $0.11, $0.12, $0.13 decremental to the operating number, and then you flush it through the EPS, you get about $0.05, I think on the midpoint.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on the Drivetrain revenues, so it sounds like some of the delayed program should be through by -- or delayed ramp should be through by the fourth quarter, but you also mentioned the tougher comps, which really should persist for, I guess, another three. So is it -- and should we expect just some lower growth overall in that segment for a couple of quarters here before a little bit of an acceleration and more towards the back-half of '15? Is that a fair way to think about it?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Well, we'll have to talk about 2015 a little bit more in January. But I think it's a fair way of thinking about it. If you look at the progression of Drivetrain over the last 18 months, you will see that surge in the second half of last year, and it has anniversary-ed now. So yes, that's going to slow down the growth a bit. And the other things that we've been talking about in that segment, the restructuring-related inefficiency. This new plant that we opened in China that's not going to start producing parts until third quarter 2015, those are going to be things that we're dealing with. We have been saying over the last couple of quarters, Drivetrain is going to be a little bit bumpy for the next few quarters, but at the end of that, the thing is going to be a much more competitive business. So we're taking those steps for the benefit of the long term.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan.","Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I know that you already dodged one backlog question, but just approaching it a different way just in terms of an overall industry background question. Can you remind us of what drove in recent years the phenomena of automakers pushing out the timing of planned new programs? Was that more about them trying to cut cost during the downturn particularly in Europe. And as sales are improving in that region, have we maybe cycled past this phenomena?","James R. Verrier","Yes, I mean just from my point, Ryan, I think if you look back on it historically, if you -- the downturn period clearly caused some of the automakers to stall and postpone and realign programs. So that was obviously a significant event. Over and above that, generally, programs really move around a little bit just based on more than anything the ability of the OEMs with their suppliers to get products launched. And when you're managing a transmission or an engine program launch over a 3- or a 4-year period, to have a month or a quarter change or a slight volume adjustment up or down, is very normal, and we have a lot of those just like any other supplier does. But -- so I would say those are the 2 points that there was a big adjustment in the past. And then normal course of business is customers will tweak programs and volume launch dates based on a number of things, and we just try and true that up, and that's why we do the backlog press just [ph] once a year.","Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And then relative to the planned slow ramp at a major customer program in North America. Now you earlier didn't want to identify that specific customer program. But maybe just along those lines, can you remind us what your biggest programs in North America are? And then specifically, what your revenue exposure might be to the Ford F series program, on which I know you've got some great turbos including 2 I think on 1 Engine, right? So...","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Yes, our largest programs are the truck programs with the domestic OEMs, generally speaking.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, a couple of questions. I just want to kind of reiterate what I think I'm hearing on Drivetrain going into 4Q in 2015. Basically, that while we have been spoiled by very strong sort of 20-ish percent incrementals in a pace to 15% margins there, at least for the first couple of quarters of 2015, as you grow into the DCT plant, before you get the benefit of other restructuring, we're not going to see that same kind of margin expansion?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","You said it very well, but I'm not going to agree to the numbers yet until we work through our 2015 plan, Brian. But I think the high level of analysis you just played out could play out that way, okay? It was very well put.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And is there any tailwind there from the shift to see these SUVs either in Europe or in China? We had great Jeep numbers yesterday, and they're launching their -- not necessarily the program you're on, but as evidence of the segment. And is that that potentially providing some revenue upside in Drivetrain?","James R. Verrier","No, I'm not sure I have that specific level of detail on that, Brian. I'll just say, in general, the growth on Drivetrain, it's been strong across both our transmission business and the overall drive business, and it's kind of multiple programs, multiple regions of the world. I mean, I think, at a macro level, I would say we've certainly benefited well from truck mix and truck strength in North America. I think that's for sure. And in Asia or China specifically, we've done very well. So I wouldn't want to break it down vehicle segment so much other than truck in North America and generally Asia, both China and Korea has been strong for us.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And as a final housekeeping, just for the fourth quarter, equity income, I think a fair amount might come from NSK-Warner. Should we be thinking about this mystery around the top line, op income and EPS? Could currency pressures in the equity income line be part of what the fourth quarter guided here?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","No. I just want to comment on the third quarter. Equity income was outstanding, and the year-over-year variance looked quite large. But actually, Brian, if you go back sequentially, it's not that far off on a sequential basis. We're just -- NSK-Warner also serves to the Chinese market, I'll just point it out that way, and a lot that came from that side of the business. But no, to answer your question, that is not impacting us on the fourth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citi.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a quick question on cash flow actually. Any update to the outlook for the full year? It seems like the operating cash flow was running a little bit behind your -- perhaps what was implied in the prior 2014 outlook.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Yes. Yes, it is. In fact, we're just talking about that a little bit this morning, about that stuff. Operating cash flow, is -- I think what we're being impacted by is restructuring activities floating in and out. Because remember, we have to start from a GAAP basis. We don't normalize it for a continuing basis, so we're seeing some of the spending of cash in restructuring activities.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Do you still expect to kind of hit that range you've previously outlined?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","No, I think, the range is going to come down slightly. We're going update that range slightly down.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, great. I'm just hoping we could talk a little bit about just your overall tone of global macro where you're seeing things a little bit better, maybe worse, and just your initial kind of industry view perhaps into 2015. Just love to get your updated thoughts there.","James R. Verrier","Maybe I would -- maybe we can start in Europe. I think as we came into the year, Itay, we were relatively cautious around growth in Europe. We said it'll be relatively very small and slow and a little bit bumpy through the year. I think that's pretty much what we've seen and we -- as we talked about it through this year, we probably anticipate a similar thing going into next year. So I think it's going to be very small kind of growth and a little bit lumpy. North America, I think, has been a strong market this year. And it's a little early to know what '15 is going to look like, but I think that's a robust market, and there'll be some growth in North America going into next year also. I think the other market of note on the macro is China, and we continue to see a relatively strong market growth in China both this year, and I wouldn't expect that to change. Next year, I think it'll be another strong growth year for China. Whether it moderates between 7%, 8%, 9% in that range, we'll see, but it's still meaningful growth. And obviously, when you layer the content growth on top of that for BorgWarner, it's a real strong platform for us. And then the other macro that we -- I alluded to earlier, Itay, was commercial vehicle, there's a little been bit of growth in North America, which has been welcome. The other regions of the world continue to be a challenge, and we're going to take a good look at that as we go through the fourth quarter of how we think that will play out next year. So not too bad overall. I mean, there's still modest to moderate growth for the industry, and it's just primarily China and North America are the 2 stronger zones for the world and for us as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault from Goldman Sachs.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just maybe 2 items left for me. So there was a question earlier about the timing of the footprint actions. Can we just go through the catalog of some of those onetimers that aren't restructuring charges, that are kind of temporary factors? I think you talked about those. Obviously, you talked about the China plant, which isn't really seeing revenue until the fourth quarter, I think. And then I thought there were some other costs had been deferred maybe in the first half of this year, end of last year that were also still coming back. So maybe just going through those items and when they're actually sort of impacting you and also how much of an impact they had this quarter would be helpful.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Sure, Pat. So we announced this restructuring back in the third quarter -- fourth quarter of 2013. And typically in the first 2 quarters, what we saw is mostly severance cost and so on and so forth, then that gets put into restructuring. What doesn't get put into the restructuring and call-out line items are items like excess labor sitting at the receiving plant, transportation cost for bringing in more inventory or shift in inventory between the plants, some bringing cost for example. Those inefficiencies at start-up, those costs are not pulled out. Those are in our operating results. Now they can be -- they can run very high at times or we can control them, but they're very difficult to actually predict to be honest. But those are the types of cost that comes into the operations at the gross profit numbers, which you saw here a little bit of a 10 basis points reduction. Those are the type of costs that come into the business. The other costs you were referring to were more on SG&A side that we deferred in 2013 for, I would say, personal development investment, I guess, is one way to say it, everything from training activities, IT, improvement, things of that nature. Those items we deferred in '13. And once the organization was given the greenlight basically in '14, that the growth was back to spend those. Those start to come into the business. So you're going to -- at the gross profit line and you starting to see that coming in SG&A line as well. Does that help you out? The timing is -- when they came in. Remember, we thought the second quarter was going to be a little bit but we saw them in the third quarter. So -- okay?","James R. Verrier","So I just want to put all Ron's explanation together, I think it's kind of worth it as we kind of come towards the end of this. BorgWarner's been performing in the mid-30s and low 30s incremental rate over a number of quarters, which is just incredible performance, which we've all talked about. And I think just to refresh what we talked about was some moderation of that back towards the mid-teens or a little above. I think that's what we're seeing. So I just want to reiterate that this is -- I think what hopefully we've been projecting and I think that's what's coming. We remain very confident that we're going to run this company with that mid-teen incremental and\/or above. And I think that's what we've demonstrated. And the third quarter is another great example of it. With all of those headwinds, we still delivered a very solid incremental. So I think -- I just think it's important we don't lose sight of that bigger view as we go forward.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, helpful. Can I just fit in one more? Just on -- there's something you said earlier I wanted to clarify about, I guess, the -- restructuring some of the -- I'm probably saying this wrong, but the legal aspects to be able to repatriate cash more effectively from overseas. And I thought you had said that that's -- maybe the language was that's going to make it easier to kind of pay dividends kind of in the 2016 time frame. But I just want to make sure that wasn't precluding cash deployment between now and then just because obviously right now you do have some acquisitions in the hopper, but you are fairly far out of that leverage range that you guys have typically kind of guided to.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Yes, let me restate what's going on here maybe. Back in the early part of the last decade, there was a legal structure that was put in place to support the strategic growth of the company. We've outgrown that structure. And growth is a little bit different now. It has to be reengineered, and we're going through the process of reengineering that structure to support different growth objectives in other parts of the world. So what this will do is this gives us more flexibility to execute that plan basically, okay? So that's what it really is. It's just that 10 years ago, it was a different business than it is today. This work that we're doing is going to provide a tremendous amount of flexibility in all aspects of our business from cash flow to other strategic items that we have on the table, and it's not inhibiting us tremendously today. It would just enhance and give us flexibility to be more proactive in the future.","Operator","Our last question will come from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just have 2 quick ones here. Just first, as we think about the pressure that you're seeing from the slow ramp of this program in North America in Drivetrain, I would assume that you'd see some pressure in the Engine business just because you have turbos on that same program. So as we see sort of this lift from the slow ramp impacting positively Drivetrain, could it also have a real positive impact on the Engine business as well as we get through the fourth quarter?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Well, I mean, yes. But to a lesser degree, I think, it's less impactful on the Engine side of the business because it's bigger business. So relatively speaking, it's not going to have a material impact. But, yes, directionally, that's correct.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And just a last question, and I hate to keep asking about this treasury reorg, but could that potentially have any impact on taxes positively or negatively, and hopefully positively, as you go through this reorg?","James R. Verrier","John, I'm not going to predict which way, but to answer your question, it would impact cash, taxes and various other items. It impacts quite a few things. We have to work through the plans. Ken, I think, said earlier is going to take us through next year. And then the outcome of that will be more clear as far as the total impacts on the total company, all right?","Kenneth Lamb","I'd like to thank you, all, again for joining us. We expect to file our 10-Q before the end of the day, which will provide details of our results. If you have any follow-up questions about our earnings release, the matters discussed during this call or our 10-Q, please direct them to me. Actually, I think I'll be quite busy this afternoon.

Also for the Q&A portion of the call, we have James Verrier, President and Chief Operating Officer ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tim.","Tim Manganello","Thank you, Ken, and good day, everyone. Today, I am pleased to review our third quarter results, as well as our third quarter accomplishments.","First, our third quarter results. Reported sales were $1.7 billion, down 5% from the same period last year. However, foreign currencies were working against us during the quarter. On a comparable basis, excluding currency and the 2011 dispositions, BorgWarner sales were up 2%. U.S. GAAP earnings were $0.85 per share, but excluding non-comparable items, our earnings were $1.19 per share.","Our reported operating income margin was 9.6%, but excluding the impact of non-comparable items, our operating income margin was 11.3%, up from 11.1% a year ago. This is outstanding margin performance in a challenging market. Two key factors drove our results. Sales were down due to a weak global economy, most notably Europe and our operating margin improved due to operating efficiencies and cost controls.","In the Engine Group, third quarter sales were about $1.2 billion, however excluding currency and 2011 dispositions, sales were about $1.3 billion or up 1%. Sales growth in Engine Timing Systems in Asia and light vehicle turbochargers in Asia and North America were offset by weak market conditions in Europe.","The Drivetrain Group also performed well in the quarter. Sales were about $534 million, up slightly from the third quarter 2011. Excluding currencies, sales were up 5%. Drivetrain\u2019s growth in the quarter was due to solid growth in all-wheel drive sales around the world, primarily in North America.","BorgWarner also continues to reinvest in our business. Our near-term capital spending plan includes increased capacity for dual-clutch transmission modules in Europe, Engine Timing Systems in Asia, transfer cases in North America and turbochargers all over the world. For the quarter, we spend about 6% of sales on CapEx and we continue to invest in technology, which is the life blood of our company. We spend about 3.8% of sales on R&D in the quarter.","I am also proud to review some exciting announcements we made during the quarter. Three BorgWarner technologies had been named finalist in the prestigious Automotive News PACE competition. We are proud of our winning record and pleased to have our technologies in the final competition once again.","BorgWarner is supplying our EGR technology to new markets; the MTU diesel engines used to power locomotives, mining equipment and pumps for the oil and gas industry are equipped with BorgWarner EGR coolers to reduce NOx emissions. ","BorgWarner\u2019s unique Cam Torque Actuated device with mid-position lock helps the 2012 Subaru Impreza offer a 30% better fuel economy compared with the previous model.","BorgWarner\u2019s Turbo Systems received the Porsche Supplier of the Year Award. The honor was given for quality, reliability and our partnership with Porsche in developing the world\u2019s first mass produced variable turbine geometry turbocharger for gasoline engines.","BorgWarner recently finalized the sale of its spark plug business which was a part of the BERU acquisition. Sales were approximately $80 million in 2011 and this will allow us to continue our focus on expanding BERU\u2019s core product lines which include glow plugs, diesel cold start systems and other gasoline ignition systems including EcoFlash.","Now let\u2019s take a look at our current outlook for 2012 light vehicle production. In North America, our outlook has improved. We now expect year-over-year growth of above 5% for the fourth quarter, up a few percentage points from our pervious outlook; strong year-to-date sales, better credit conditions and healthy inventory levels have improved our outlook. Japanese OEMs in North America continue to replenish their inventory and this is driving a significant portion of this year\u2019s growth in North America.","Our outlook for Europe has weakened. The economic slowdown that has impacted Southern Europe has now spread to Northern Europe. As a result, we saw steep schedule cuts across Europe in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter. Previously, we expected light vehicle volumes to decline about 5% in the fourth quarter, we now expect volumes to be down around 13% and much of the change in our outlook is due to the volume declines in high end vehicles. These high end vehicles tend to have more BorgWarner content than the lower end vehicles.","We also expect slower light vehicle production growth in China for the remainder of the year. Previously, we expected growth of merely 10% in the fourth quarter of 2012. We now expect growth in China of around 5%.","Our outlook for the commercial truck market has also weakened. In all four markets where we compete, Europe, North America, Brazil and China projected volumes for the fourth quarter have decreased. We still expect growth in North America for 2012, but this is down from our July projection. The other three markets are expected to contract.","Finally, let\u2019s review our updated sales and earnings guidance. Our sales growth in 2012 is now expected to be zero to plus 1% compared with our previous guidance of 4% to 6% growth. Excluding currency, our sales growth is now expected to be 5% to 6% compared with our previous guidance of 9% to 11%.","A lead change in our sales guidance is due to the broadening global economic slowdown especially in Europe and its impact on the automotive industry. Despite this, we expect our sales growth to outperform the market this year on a comparable basis. And Ron, will provide details about our performance relative to the market in a few minutes. Our 2012 earnings guidance excluding non-comparable items is now $4.90 to $5 per share, down from $5.05 to $5.25 per share previously. This change is due to our expectation of lower sales and again Ron will explain that shortly. We are on track towards achieving our targeted full year operating margin of 11.5% or better, having posted 11.9% excluding non-comparable items in the first nine months of this year. ","Now in conclusion we have lowered our expectations for the remainder of the year in light of the broadening global economic slowdown and its impact on the automotive industry. Despite these headwinds, our company is operating at a very high level. Our expected operating margin of 11.5% or better excluding non-comparable items will be an all time record high for BorgWarner. And the new EPS guidance also represents an all time record year for BorgWarner with an increase of 10% to 12% over our 2011 EPS. ","No company in the auto sector is better positioned to absorb short term market fluctuations and to deliver long term profitable growth than BorgWarner. Our confidence is based on our proven business strategy. We see field cost continuing to trend higher. The regulatory environment continues to become more stringent and drivers continue to demand better performance. BorgWarner\u2019s focus on advanced technologies to improve fuel economy, reduce emissions and enhance vehicle performance is right on target. And we expect strong demand for our products to continue for many years to come. ","Our technology leadership, strong global presence, financial discipline and our focus on attracting and maintaining a talented work force had been the keys to BorgWarner\u2019s long term success. I feel very good about the company's future and so should our shareholders. ","And now I would like to turn the meeting over to Ron.","Ron Hundzinski","Thank you Tim and good day everyone. Before I begin reviewing the financials, I would like to put BorgWarner\u2019s performance into perspective within the broader auto industry. Global light vehicle production was up 2% in the third quarter compared with the same quarter last year. BorgWarner\u2019s reported sales were down 5% from a year ago. As Tim explained earlier, if we exclude the impact of foreign currencies and M&A activity in 2011, our sales were up 2% in the quarter. To get a clear picture of our performance relative to the market, we need to review light vehicle and commercial vehicle market separately. ","First let's take a closer look at the light vehicle market from a regional perspective. In Asia which I'm defining as China, Korea and Japan, light vehicle production was up 2%. Our light vehicle sales in Asia excluding currency were up 15%. In Europe, light vehicle production was down between 6% and 9% depending on the source. Our light vehicle sales excluding currency in 2011 disposals were flat. In North America, light vehicle production was up 12%. As Tim said earlier, Japanese vehicle manufacturers continued to replenish their inventories in North America. This activity drove much of the volume growth in North America in the third quarter. Our light vehicle sales growth in North America was about 12% in line with the market. However, excluding (inaudible) the Tsunami related inventory replenishment, we outperformed the North American light vehicle market as well.","Now, lets review the commercial vehicle market. The third quarter saw continued weakness in commercial vehicle markets around the world, with exception of North America, which was basically flat. Each of our commercial vehicle markets experienced double-digit production volume declines. As a result, our commercial vehicle sales were down 10% in the quarter.","Let me summarize this. Our typical out performance of the light vehicle markets was intact in the third quarter, despite outperforming the market in Europe at 6% to 9% volume decline in that market had an oversize impact on BorgWarner. The European light vehicle market represent nearly half of our sales, but less than quarter of a global light vehicle production market. Also weak commercial vehicle markets around the world resulted in a 10% sales decline for us in the segment, representing nearly 20% of our business.","Alright, let me go to the income statement. Working down the income statement, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 20.3% for the quarter, that\u2019s up from 19.6% a year ago despite about 5 million in higher raw material prices. SG&A expenses were 8.9% of sales in the quarter versus 8.5% of sales in the third quarter last year. The increase was due to an increase in R&D spending, which as a percentage of sales was 3.8% in the quarter, up 50 basis points from a year ago.","Reported operating income in the quarter was a 163 million. However, this includes disposal and restructuring expenses associated with the sale of our Spark Plug business. You may recall that in the second quarter, we signed a master purchase agreement for the disposal of the business and wrote down 38 million of prior purchase accounting adjustments relating to spark plug business. ","In the third quarter, we incurred an additional 28 million of restructuring related costs associated with the asset disposal and future requirements of the BERU ongoing business. ","Of the 67 million, total charge taken over the two quarters, only about 20 million will be cash payments, primarily related to severance cost. Most of this cash will be spent in the next two quarters although there may be some minor payments that extent beyond that period. ","We estimate that our savings also primarily related to severance will be about [$30 million] per year or about a year and a half payback period. The $29 million charge taken this quarter and shows up another income expense line item of our income statement. Excluding the charge, operating income was a 192 million or 11.3% of sales compared with a 199 million or 11.1% of sales on a comparable basis a year ago. The 11.3% operating income margin is a new third quarter record for the company, after excluding the impact of foreign currency in non-comparable items in both this quarter and the third quarter of 2011, our incremental margin was about 17% in the quarter which reflects outstanding cost control in a very challenging sales environment.","As you look further down to income statement, equity and affiliate earnings was 11 million down slightly from 12 million last year. This represents the performance of NSK-Warner, our 50-50 joint venture in Japan, which sells transmission components to our Japanese customers in Japan and China, as well as TEL, our turbocharger joint venture in India. Interest expense and finance charges were $5 million in the quarter, down from $19 million a year ago.","This was primarily due to the maturity of our convertible debt settled with treasury shares in mid-April. Note that this reduction in convertible related interest expense did not impact earnings per share. We have been calculating EPS on an if-converted basis from the first quarter of 2010 until the securities matured in mid-April.","Provision for income taxes was $64 million in the quarter, which is a 38% effective tax rate, however the provision includes a few items were noting here. There was an $8 million tax benefit related to the restructuring activities, there is a $7 million tax expenses related to the closure of certain tax audits in the period and then $11 million tax expense due to capital gain on the assets disposals that we discussed earlier.","The net impact of all these items is $10 million increased in tax expense. Excluding these discreet items, our tax expense was $54 million in the quarter or a run rate effective tax rate of 27%. Net earnings attributable to non-controlling interest was $4.8 million in the quarter, down slightly from $5.1 million a year ago.","This line item reflects our minority partners share in earnings performance of our Korean and Chinese consolidated joint ventures. This brings us back to net earnings, which were a $101 million in the quarter, or $0.85 per share, on a reported basis. On a comparable basis, net earnings were $141 million in the quarter, or $1.19 per share, up from $1.15 per share a year ago. That's a 4% earnings growth rate on a 5% declined on reported sales. Very strong performance for the company. Also note that foreign currency reduced earnings per share by about $0.08 in the quarter. ","Now let's take a closer look at our operating groups. Engine group sales were $1.2 billion in the quarter, excluding currency in 2011 dispositions, Engine Group sales were up 1% compared with the third quarter of 2011. We are seeing good growth in engine timing including VCT in Asia and light vehicle turbochargers in Asia and North America. ","However, the slowdown in light vehicle production in Europe and in the commercial vehicle markets around the globe offset much of that growth. Adjusted EBIT for the engine group was $184 million in the quarter or 15.8% of sales. That's a significant improvement from the 15% adjusted EBIT margin we reported a year ago. The year-over-year incremental margin excluding currency and in 2011 dispositions was over 40% in outstanding operational performance by the Engine Group. ","In the Drivetrain Group sales were $534 million in the quarter, excluding currency Drivetrain Group sales were up 5% compared with the third quarter of 2011, strong all-wheel-drive system sales around the world but primarily in North America were the key growth driver in the quarter. ","On a reported basis, adjusted EBIT was $44 million or 8.3% of sales. This is up 20 basis points from the third quarter of 2011. The year-over-year incremental margin for the Drivetrain Group excluding currency was 9%. While this appears to be under performance to our BorgWarner standards, the year-over-year variances were very small. A $2 million improvement in operating income over $25 million improvement in sales is very small change in the business can have an outsized impact in the calculation when the numbers are that small. ","The Group\u2019s EBIT margin for the first nine months of this year was 9.2%. This is a good indicator that we are still on track for the Drivetrain Group to achieve an EBIT margin of 9% or better this year. If you look at the balance sheet and cash flow, we generated about $543 million of net cash from operating activities in the first nine months of 2012. This is up $70 million from the first nine months of 2011. ","Capital spending was $283 million for the first nine months of 2012, up $9 million from the same period a year ago. Our capital spending is required to support our program launches around the world particularly in Asia, South America, Eastern Europe and Mexico. ","Free cash flow during the period which we define as net cash from operating activities less capital spending including tooling was $260 million. Looking at the balance sheet itself, balance sheet that decreased by $226 million compared with the end of 2011. Cash increased by $262 million during the same period. This $488 million decrease in net debt was primarily due to net cash provided by operating activities and the maturity of our convertible debt partially offset by share repurchases in the first and second quarters. ","At the end of the third quarter, our net debt-to-capital ratio was 14.3% compared to 28.3% at the end of 2011. Net debt-to-EBITDA at the end of third quarter of 2012 on a trailing 12 months basis was 0.4 times. Our capital structure remains in excellent shape. ","Okay, I will go to the 2012 guidance now. Due to weaker global economic conditions particularly in Europe and its impact on automotive industry, our sales guidance has come down. We now expect sales to grow from 0% to 1% in 2012, compared with our previous guidance of 4% to 6%. If you do the math, our full-year guidance implies fourth quarter sales should be down 3% to 7% year-over-year.","Excluding currency, our 2012 sales growth is now expected to be 5% to 6% compared with our previous guidance of 9% to 11%. We now expect our full-year earnings to be within a range of $4.90 to $5.00 per diluted share compared with our previous guidance of $5.05 to $5.25 per diluted share. The lower EPS guidance is directly resulted of our lower sales guidance.","From a margin perspective, we still expect to achieve our operating margin of better than 11.5% for the full-year. Our operating margin of 11.9% in the first nine months of the year is a solid indicator that we're on track to meet that goal. We have tightened the range on net cash provided from operating activities to $900 million to $950 million, within the previous range of $900 million to $1 billion. ","Capital spending is now expected to be within a range of $400 million to $450 million, down from $450 million to $500 million previously. Free cash flow which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending is expected to be about $500 million this year.","The tax rate remains at 27% and the return on invested capital is still expected to be greater than 20%. Our year-over-year incremental margin for 2012 is complicated by the projected sales decline in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date, our incremental margin was about 24%. In the fourth quarter, we are targeting a decremental margin in that same range. ","We still believe that the impact of higher raw material costs will be in the $25 million to $30 million in 2012. As we stated all year, we will absorb and manage our inflationary costs including raw materials. We will not (inaudible) to have a material impact on earnings expectations for the year.","So in conclusion, our operating margin and earnings per share in the third quarter on a comparable basis were third quarter records for the company. Operationally, the company continues to perform at a high level in a very challenging environment for growth. Weakening market conditions have resulted in a lower outlook of sales growth and earnings growth in 2012. ","However, we expect 2012 to be another year of record margins and record profits for BorgWarner. Tim talked about confidence in their strategy over the long-term, but we are equally confident in our execution over the short-term. This company has demonstrated a heightened focus on efficiency and cost control since the 2009 recession. This focus resulted in a highly efficient growth and record margins in 2010 and 2011 and despite the 2012 being a challenging year from a growth perspective we expect to achieve record margins again. ","Over the long-term, we intend to execute our growth strategy and over the short-term remain focused on efficiency regardless of the direction of the market. ","With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Ken.","Ken Lamb","Thanks Ron. Now let\u2019s move to the Q&A portion of the call. Ron Hundzinski and James Verrier will be taking your questions. I would ask the call coordinator to please announce the Q&A procedure.","Question-and-Answer Session"," ","Operator"," ","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities","I guess Ron, or James. Could you give us a just a feel for what you seeing are right now in Europe, you took the production down 13% for the fourth quarter that may not be as conservative as what we extend from other supplier that are thinking it could be on 15% or more. How confident are you in the 13% number and then it looks like first quarter looks to be something similar in terms of a decline for next year at least according to [IHS]? What do you see, you are seeing any signs of stabilization right now or is this kind of still job that cuts it still and then there are still risks to it?","James Verrier","Rich, this is James. Let me talk probably about the fourth quarter more than the first quarter. I think candidly we need a little more time to really get a better view of the first quarter; we are trying to work away through the fourth quarter. In terms of the 13% number for the fourth quarter, we feel pretty comfortable with that number, the risk to it frankly is the month of December, that's the element that makes it a little challenging in terms of what the customers will do as they comes to close out at the end of the year. But as we sit here today and we look at the schedules and we talk to the customers, we look at our actual run rates in the third quarter and we look the projective run rate of actual through the month of October, that gives us frankly more confident and confidence around the 13% number, but could it be a percent or so either side of that, absolutely that's the possible Rich. I think as Ron, alluded to though, if it is a little different to that 13% we feel very comfortable and confident in our ability to execute against that if there is a slight shift. So that, if that helps you, that\u2019s kind of the view that we\u2019re seeing right now.","Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities","And then your temporary workforce there is much higher than it four or five years right, so are you starting to take, try to take advantage of that right now, I assume you are but, what\u2019s the status of that?","Tim Manganello","Yeah, let me give some color on that Rich. In the earlier part of the year, let's say the first half of the year, our temporary employees as a percentage of our total direct work force was probably in the mid 20% range which as you point out is very much higher than where we were a number of years ago, which was very intentional strategy on our part.","As we've worked through the third quarter that number\u2019s come down a little, so we are probably in the 20% range as we operated in the third quarter. And based on the production outlook and the schedules we seek for the fourth quarter, we are probably going to end up around approximately about 10% number as we come towards the end of the fourth quarter.","So we've used that flexibility to deliver the type of performance that we've shown. In addition Rich to we also used a little bit of a reduction in the actual work week from the six days down to five in some of our facilities.","Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities","And then just a broader question, acquisitions, what do you think out there in terms of pricing and the types of property that you are interested in and any change or any thought on that front would be helpful? Thanks.","Tim Manganello","Rich we continue to look very aggressively and I think consistent with what we've said in the past, our clear focus is to look for technology leading companies and companies with growth and that's really been our focus and it continues to be our focus.","And I think just as we've said in the past Rich we have a number of targets that we are continuing to work hard on, to try and bring one or more of those over the line. It will stay in the areas that we are in, adjacent areas of Engine and Drivetrain. There's quite a number of them and we continue to be pretty aggressive in our search for bringing one of those home. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton from KeyBanc Capital.","Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital","","If I did my math correctly, I mean I have, to get to the $1.19 I'm using net interest expense of $4 million and that's lower than we would have anticipated. And I guess my question is on a run rate basis, where would you expect your kind of net interest expense to be?","Ron Hundzinski","Yeah, Brett, the way I think it\u2019s about $5 million actually I have net interest. We had a couple of things in the quarter that was favorable; we have an interest rate swap that actually went favorable on us as well. So I don't think we are going to stay at that rate of $5 million interest expense going forward. I think mark-to-market on that cross interest rate swap will come back. So I would go more back to the second quarter and then maybe adjust for the convertible on a run rate basis going forward. Okay.","Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital","And then as you think about the restructuring, the savings of $13 million per year, can you characterize the timing of that; I mean you've just announced the program, is that something you expect to achieve in 2013 or should we blend that into 2014 as well?","Ron Hundzinski","I'm expecting to start seeing those benefits in 2013; because the way the program works as those employees should be out of our facilities fairly soon here which means I won't have that cost going forward.","Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital","I guess my question is, would you expect to achieve the full $13 million in 2013 or would you only achieve maybe half of that in 2013 and the remaining portion of it in 2014?","Ron Hundzinski","Well, I would like to see it all, but I'm working with a works council in another country that I am sure I will see some deterioration in that $13 million, so maybe half or something like that for next year.","Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital","And then as we think about the backlog, you\u2019ll normally make an announcement, I think somewhere in that at the end of November, but can you talk a little bit about, one, when you plan on making a backlog announcement? And then two, it sounds like from previous comments, the bidding activities been pretty robust, but obviously production has been lower and so can you talk about when, can you talk about the robustness of the bidding activity and then can you talk a little bit about maybe some variations in production expectations versus last year?","James Verrier","Yeah, Brad, this is James. So in terms of when we will announce it, it\u2019s next week at the Baird Conference. So that\u2019s next Tuesday. So we will be announcing it and taking you guys through the details next Tuesday. So I don\u2019t want to comment obviously prior to that, but we're working very hard. Kenny is doing his magical work as ever. So we will be ready next Tuesday to give you an update.","In terms of the quoting and bidding activity, it remains very strong for us as we look at how this year is stacking up with prior years. We're very pleased where we see our activity year-to-date. And I would say, it's healthy across the different product lines and it's pretty healthy across the regions. Now, we're just going through the process of calculating that and putting it into the appropriate models and that\u2019s what we will bring to the meeting next Tuesday, Brett.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Itay Michaeli from Citi. Your line is now open.","Itay Michaeli - Citi","I wanted to talk about the fourth quarter walk sequentially on margin; typically the fourth quarter is a higher margin quarter than the third quarter; I think that\u2019s been typical even in the quarters in the past where revenue has been flattish sequentially. It looks like from new guidance you may be assuming you\u2019re kind of flat to even down margin sequentially. So can you help us out in terms of the walk is anything different that\u2019s occurring this year versus prior years from a seasonal perspective?","","Ron Hundzinski","The only thing I would say is that on the gross profit margin I expect us to have the same performance we have had. I would say that we are probably deleveraging a little bit on SG&A because of R&D spend, that\u2019s probably where our focus is which your walk issue is right now. We continue to invest in R&D and that\u2019s going to have a little bit deleveraging in SG&A.","","Itay Michaeli - Citi","Great Ron and then you mentioned I believe if I heard correctly is that you are expecting lower CapEx this year. Can you talk a little bit by what\u2019s driving that, may be talk to any additional deferrals you may be seeing in the backlog and then how should we think about CapEx may be in the next couple of years relative to revenue?","","Ron Hundzinski","Yeah Itay, I thought I would get that question. I want to be clear, it\u2019s not related to cancellations of programs, what it is it\u2019s just the spending rates not where we thought it was going to be when we took a look. The programs are still in place it\u2019s just that the pace we are putting it on is not at the same pace we thought in the middle part of the year. As far as your view going forward, I would expect the spend at the same rate of percentage of sales that we have done in the past and no significant change in that area.","","Itay Michaeli - Citi","Great and then just lastly given that the macro pressure as everyone is seeing, how are you guys thinking, how confident are you around BorgWarner\u2019s ability to outgrow the market 8% to 10% per year going forward; should we expect may be a bit of a low in that outperformance given the macro pressures and your overweight in the European region, are you still fairly comfortable you can deliver that type of growth in the next couple of years?","James Verrier","Yeah Itay, this is James, all right. Let me start with maybe the basic thing. We are very comfortable and very confident about the story of BorgWarner. If you think about it over the long term, nothing has changed fundamentally, the need for greater fuel economy, better emissions and better performance all of those needs are still strong and very, very strong and BorgWarner has the products for that.","So the fundamentals Itay of the story are absolutely solid and we feel very, very comfortable in that technology and our ability to drive that growth. Really the detail of what the next the two or three looks like, we will get a better looks as we puts together the net new booking business. A little more than half of that business is in Europe, so that does weigh on us a little, as does the commercial vehicle business which is 15% of our business and that markets down a little bit.","So there are some pressures on that, so I think as Ron, went through his breakdown of our performance growth is the markets; you will see some of that weighed on us in the fourth quarter and somewhat in the third quarter. So in the short term we are going to see some of those headwinds weighing on us a little bit from a outperformance versus the market, but we\u2019ll still have growing in most regions and in most product lines, and fundamentally we think that\u2019s absolutely we are going to continue on, but we will provide more data and more color on it next Tuesday when we do the net new book of business Itay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ceraso from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Chris Ceraso - Credit Suisse","I was wondering if you could help me parch out the impact of weaker commercial volumes in the quarter, back at the envelope math, I am thinking revenues in dollars were down maybe $30 million year-to-year, tell me if I'm in the right neighborhood there, and if that's so what was the ballpark decremental margin on that, is it a higher decremental hit because it\u2019s in the commercial market.","Ron Hundzinski","No. Decremental margin are in line with our normal decremental margins first of all Chris. The commercial vehicle market was down 10%. Our sales were down 10% in the commercial vehicle market in the quarter.","Chris Ceraso - Credit Suisse","Right, I was trying to translate that into dollars, is it around $30 million.","Ron Hundzinski","We figure its about almost 20% of our sales, we are down 10%. Okay, Chris, so 20%, almost 20% of our sales were down at $30 million to $35 million in that range. ","Chris Ceraso - Credit Suisse","Can you give us an update on how much new business came on in the quarter and what you are expecting in terms of new business to come on-stream in the fourth quarter?","Ron Hundzinski","You know Chris that's a hard number for us to do. We typically look at the backlog on a linear perspective through the period. So basically period one or year one, two, and three is linear by $833 million what we've done in the past. Now as you go through the cycle of a given year, it\u2019s not necessarily linear sometimes because the launches take place in the beginning of the summer right. I have to do some numbers and get back with you to crunch that over and get some numbers around that Chris. I don't have that handy in my head right now.","Chris Ceraso - Credit Suisse","And then just a last one maybe talk about the mix of business particularly in Europe. You know some of the markets where you have good diesel penetration were hit pretty hard, was the decline in the diesel mix a big problem for you in Q3 and then is that something that you think gets worse in Q4 or is it better or is it the same.","Tim Manganello","I think there were two major shifts if that's the right word Chris. One was I'll say the Northern European customers are in focused primarily on the German OEMs that really started to cut schedules at a faster rate than they had done earlier in the year, and there was still a little bit of further erosion with the Southern European guys. But the real story was the Northern European predominantly German OEMs really started to cut into the schedules.","And then the other thing that we see that's an impact on BorgWarner is, what I call the high content costs, the higher value type vehicles which typical BorgWarner is a little biased to or weighted to because of technology. Those schedule cuts were quite significant in the end of the third quarter and the fourth quarter and a lot of those cuts had already been made in the smaller lower technology lower end vehicles. So those are the two fundamentals Chris that did it. It was less gasoline diesel mix, it was more vehicle content mix and Northern European Southern European shift. Does that help you out?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault from Goldman Sachs.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","","I think you used to characterize your operating leverages being sort of if you out grew the industry by 8% to 10% that was what would allow you to see margin expansion at least whole margins. You know, clearly, I know I mean it's a bit difficult because you have the distortion of the commercial vehicle side, but it seems that your content growth was probably lower than that, across your end markets this quarter, yet you still managed to post a decent margin expansion year-on-year. So maybe you could just talk to us a little bit about that equation going forward, is that sort of need to outgrow the industry by that number, gone down just given your cost structure, given some of the leverage that you have been able to find. Just help us frame the margin expansion opportunity from this pretty high level here.","Tim Manganello","Sure, Patrick, the way we look at margin expansion is over the long run, not specific to a quarter-to-a quarter. Over the long run, we know that we need that growth to expand our margins. But bring it back to the quarter, I would just be honest, our operating guys have just done an outstanding job to ensure that we're managing the market right now and getting cost out of the plants on the short run and getting discretionary spending down, getting our labor cost in line and they are just doing a great job. They are outperforming themselves right now. Now, over the long run, that\u2019s going to be difficult for them to do that. In the short run, they did a great job and I still hold that in the long run I need that 8% to 10% sales growth to expand my margins.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","Okay, so you sort of revert back to the backlog obviously being the principal driver. One other one, kind of getting back in to the performance for this quarter; on page six of your release I think you said that incremental margins for engines was 40% which is indeed pretty big performance. Can you just give us a little bit more color what was behind that, because obviously Drivetrain was the one with some low hanging fruit but the engine conversion was obviously pretty phenomenal.","","Ron Hundzinski","I said in the script about smaller numbers having a larger impact and that implies to the engine group as well as the Drivetrain. We could have in a given quarter a huge cost reduction program that really took effect the volumes came in as far as the cost reductions and had a big bump in our incremental margins. That could happen in a give quarter, because it\u2019s not smooth throughout the year. Again I go back to the operating guys just really watching the business and executing on the operating front is what we are seeing in the quarter.","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Leiker from Robert W. Baird & Co. Your line is open.","","Joe Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co.","This is Joe Vruwink on the line for David. If I just take the end market assumptions Tim mentioned and I weight them by your sales mix. I am coming out with a global volume assumption of let\u2019s say down 6% in Q4, and if I compare that with where I think your organic growth guidance places you I think your organic growth guidance places you, I think you are looking for may be down 1%. So a type of margin, a down 5% is obviously below what you normally do and this quarter and may be saw a few percentage points. So can you may be touch on why that margin is below the normal 8% to 10%.","Ron Hundzinski","I think what you are not taking in to consideration is the mix in that change as well that James talked about a few minutes ago, which gets in to another dimension of calculation I guess is what I would say. So that\u2019s the missing equation there for you.","Joe Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co.","May be just switching over an expense item; you said in the past that you expect your company to generally be in need of R&D around 4% of sales. I think the target for this year is so around 3.7%, while the 4% is line in with what you historically have done this year, obviously a much bigger company now where it is historically. So at some point, just see absolute level of R&D spending facilitate the growth ambitions you have and we might not actually need that get back to the 4% level?","Ron Hundzinski","I would at this point still and subscribe to the target of 4%. We struggled this year to get to the 4% in the early part of the year only because the sales grew in the first part. Our goal is still to continue to spend in R&D, at whatever levels appropriate and we currently still think that\u2019s above 4% of our sales, I don't see a coming back on that at all at this point.","Joe Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Okay.","James Verrier","Joe, this is James. I just add on what Ron, said and I fully agree with Ron. We have no intension to slowdown our R&D investment and growth rate. I think as we\u2019ve disclosed in prior earnings calls, it\u2019s been a challenge for us to get to that 4% rate because of our rapid sales growth. But when I look out there at the areas of opportunities that I see for technology development for this company, and how we can support the OEMs around the world, there is no reason for us to slowdown. We\u2019ve got some phenomenal technology next generation technology that we are working on, it has been the happy that this company for long time and it will continue on. So we are going to drive aggressively to that 4%.","Joe Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Okay, and then my last one. If I think about your acquisition strategy historically, I mean when you've made these big acquisitions you've also been growing in the normal level of out performance and so I think what we might not be seeing is that while the former version of BorgWarner maybe is having slowing growth the fact that you've acquired technology is then and are growing those and layering that into the business mix kind of keeps that 8% to 10% margin at that level and its been at that level for more than a decade. Now that margin is seemingly starting to maybe erode a little bit. So our acquisitions are a more important piece of hitting in the 8% to 10% out performance or are you confident with the technologies you have Dytech and Haldex acquisitions in the past few years that organically without acquisitions you can get back to your normal out performance margins?","Tim Manganello","Joe, the quick and simple answer is we expect and we believe by the way we will get the growth both from the organic piece of our company and from the acquisitions that we bring into the company. One of the things that we've talked about in the past where we are looking for companies so that we try to acquire, two critical elements that we need, one is technology and the other is the ability to grow, and obviously those two things go hand-in-hand. So if you look at the let me say the track record of the acquisitions that we bought in and integrated into the company, yeah, they performed very well and they have delivered on the growth targets and expectations that we had as well as the financial performance. But the organic or existing base part of the company is absolutely the same way. All of if you look across our business, all of our products are lined up for the growth rates to meet the fuel economy standards and the emissions performance that's out there. So we don't really differentiate between one carrying the other or one outweighing the other. You make a small variances year-to-year in a business unit or a product line, but in general the belief in the way we run the company is both organic and acquired companies. We are expecting to drive the double-digit growth rate.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","","I would like to follow-up on Patrick Archambault\u2019s question on the 8% to 10% historical growth needed to maintain margin. The reason for that as you guys have explained it is you have to offset about $100 million of price and maybe $25 million or $30 million of [raws] and other content costs and $50 million of wages. Can you just speak broadly about as you look out to 2013, you are taking mitigating actions, you are taking short (inaudible) weeks and there's some restructuring. So as we look out in the future how might that 8% to 10% be modified, looking forward just from some of these actions that you are taking?","Ron Hundzinski","","I don't expect, we run this business over the long run. We've always stated that and our stated goal is 8% to 10% over the long run. I would expect that, that same operating model to be in place over the next several years as well. Obviously, you are going to have quarters that are a little bit more narrow in growth and quarters that expand and I would just say that over a three year period that we still expect over that average of the three years period would still be in that 8% to 10% growth rate over a three year period. I mean, historically we haven't seen a flat market that long. It\u2019s usually one, two three quarters and you start to get growth again.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Okay, but over a temporary, lets say, two or three quarter period of inventory destocking, should we be thinking about other mitigating factors that you might be taking?","Ron Hundzinski","We're going to manage this business on a day-to-day basis over a period of two quarters to three quarters and we are trying to get at the margin deterioration would happen in that period. We're going to be hard pressed to whole margins. There is no question. But I am confident, we have an operating group right now that understands this and is going to work everything, do everything they can right now to hold their margins.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Okay and I would like to ask also about the outlook for [NSK-1] or if you can just provide some commentary about that earnings contribution just given what\u2019s been happening with the Japanese automakers and exposure to China through that, is that something that you would expect would be material or any thoughts broadly about how broadly we should be projecting that business for you?","Tim Manganello","No, I wouldn\u2019t say its material. You are going to have couple of hundred thousand dollars changes here and stuff like that but I wouldn\u2019t suspect it\u2019s a material event for us. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","[Technical Difficulty]","Ken Lamb","Excuse me, John; we can\u2019t hear you very clear.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Can you hear me now?","Tim Manganello","Yeah, that\u2019s better, okay if you could start all over again.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sure, you guys were highlighting, you know, the Germans are actually now seeing weakness with their production. I am just curious. As you look at the mix of their business, that shipped out to China and then shipped out to the US, two markets that remain relatively strong for sales and actually maybe improving as we go into next year. As we think about your content on those vehicles, can you sort of (inaudible) better or worse, where may be on a dollar basis or just directionally what those vehicles have versus what is actually being shipped into Europe?","James Verrier","","John I would say the one way to look at it is Europe as a percentage of our total business is about 56% of our sales about 5% to 8% of our total sales go from out of that European content into North America or to China primarily. And I would say the content on those vehicles is relatively similar to what we would have in Europe, so that the vehicle mix at a different way John or the mix that we see in Europe how that helps us in our base European business is properly similar on that 5% to 8% of our business that gets exported out to predominantly China and the US. If that helps you out John",".","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, so the strength in China and the US will only be very small offset weakness in the Europe is sort of what I am getting at.","","James Verrier","","Yeah, it helps us a little bit yeah that\u2019s a good assumption John.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then also just in the longer term and we are slowly seeing the depth of the dream of the electric car here in many different avenues, it\u2019s becoming more obvious it\u2019s not a near-term phenomenon. I am just curious as that becomes more of a reality is like the slowing of that or the depth of that are you seeing more activity or more interest from some of the automakers that were really a big focus on electric vehicles and then shifting may be their long-term and may be short-term strategies?","Tim Manganello","","The depth of the dreams and interest in price, John I have not heard that one before but what we are seeing and what we continue to see is somewhat of a reduced or demised focus on electric vehicle and more and more focus on the internal combustion engines type technology and hybrid technology and the type of transmission technology that we have always talked about. So we are seeing that activity very, very strong and I agree with you so we see less focus, less enthusiasm around full electric vehicle.","","Operator","We have time for one final question and that question comes from Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets","I just wanted to quickly go back to the out performance in Europe, I just wanted to from a longer term perspective make sure I am thinking about this correctly, if we are to enter a period in Europe over the next three years, four years where it is flattish growth, can you still see enough content being added and penetration to get back to that 8% to 10% out performance in that region?","James Verrier","I would think about that, if I look it on, just look at this year today, so if you look at this year where we\u2019ve seen some pretty, we are seeing some pretty significant reductions in Europe. Our out performance is straight through that. Will that change a couple of percentage points quarter-to-quarter that is very possible. We can't always say every quarter is going to be 8 to 10; those vehicle mix that things go on. But fundamentally, I look at this year, I look at a challenging quarter like the third quarter, I look at the fourth quarter, I look at the reductions that we are seeing in European schedules and out performance in Europe remains to outperform that. So that's how I am viewing it. I look more of what's happened and to give me confidence.","So the short story is that I believe we will continue to outgrow, outperform Europe. Will that always be 8 to 10, will it be little less or little more, there always be some variability, but the fundamentals of our outperforming in Europe will continue on, is my view.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets","Okay and then moving onto the luxury where it is obviously a little bit of catch-up in destocking. Is it fair to assume that given that it is a smaller market than the volume market that the destocking could happen over quicker timeframe than what we have seen occur in the volume market?","James Verrier","Could it be quicker? That\u2019s a good question, I am not really sure it would be quicker. I mean as you can see, you pointed to a smaller piece of the overall pie, so we have (inaudible) can adjust those schedules assignments I would say the high volume schedule. So I don't view it fundamentally in a different way, does that makes sense to you?","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And then just one on housekeeping, others may miss this but are there any further buybacks factored into the outlook?","Ron Hundzinski","At this point no there is not.","Ken Lamb","","I would like to thank you all for joining us.

We encourage you to follow along during our discussion.","With that, I'll turn it over to Fr\u00e9d.","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased to share our results from Q3 and update you on our progress towards delivering our full year targets. I'll start by sharing a few thoughts on the macro environment and the industry, as shown on slide 6. Overall, I'm very proud to say that our growth over market was slightly stronger than we expected, while at the same time, global light vehicle production was much weaker.","Let me first make a few remarks about the industry in Q3. Global light vehicle production came in down about 3% versus our expectation of more than 2% growth going into the quarter. This is a 500 basis points headwind versus our expectations. European light vehicle production was down 6% year-over-year as our customers continue to work through WLTP certification. Diesel\/gas mix in Europe continues to shift. The diesel share declined by approximately 800 basis points year-over-year in Q3.","Moving to China, light vehicle production was down 4% year-over-year, which was 700 basis points weaker than our expectations. North American light vehicle production increased 2% year-over-year and growth in our commercial vehicle business was about a 50 basis point top line benefit year-over-year.","Moving to the industry for full year, our expectations are consistent with what we provided last month. This implies a slightly declining global production adjusted for our geographic exposure. Looking at the regions, we expect China flat to down 1%, Europe flat to down 1%, and North America pretty much flat. We still see continued industry headwinds for the remainder of 2018. We expect that the short-term production issues in Europe related to WLTP will continue into Q4. Also, in China, we're expecting industry volumes to remain under pressure through year end. But the key is that we expect to continue to outgrow the market in 2018 based on continued strong demand for our products.","Let me now move to slide 7 to give you a brief summary of our Q3 results. Overall, I'm very pleased to the way the team is reacting to the weakening industry backdrop. With $2.5 billion in sales, we're up 3.6% organically excluding FX and Sevcon. This compares to our end market exposure, as mentioned before, down approximately 3%. So, our growth over the market was very strong in the quarter at more than 600 basis points.","Looking at our regional growth, North America revenue grew double-digit. We saw low- to mid-single-digit growth in China despite the market decline. Europe revenue declined slightly year-over-year. This light vehicle growth was supplemented by positive revenue trends in commercial vehicle and off-road. Our earnings per share is at $1.00 excluding non-comparable items.","Now, for the full year, our organic growth outlook is unchanged from the guidance we provided last month at our Investor Day. We continue to expect organic growth of 4.5% to 5.5% or organic growth of 500 basis points plus over market at the midpoint. We expect our earnings per share to be at $4.35 to $4.40, up 15% to 16% year-over-year. Looking at the market volatility and as we see the risks today, we expect to be at the mid- to low-end of this guidance.","Despite the near-term industry volume challenges, we must remain focused on continuing to win new business with our customers around the world, and we shared several key awards during the quarter that are highlighted on slide 8. We would like to highlight two of them today. First, our electric drive module for the new electric vehicles from Great Wall Motors, this includes our EV transmission and electric motor system.","Secondly, I'd like to point out that we're seeing traction on booking significant amount of business with our High Voltage Coolant Heater for battery electric vehicle. This quarter, we acquired two pieces of business: one in Europe, and one in Asia. We also would like to point out that our win rates across all propulsion systems \u2013 combustion, hybrid, and electric \u2013 are strong.","Finally, I wanted to recap very briefly the highlights of our last Investor Day on slide 9. Our new business win supports the long-term outlook we shared last month. We expect 2023 revenue of $14 billion before any benefits from M&A. By 2023, we'll be overweight hybrid and electric revenue compared to industry volume, and we're targeting $1 billion of free cash flow in 2023.","These targets are achievable because electrification accelerates the opportunities for BorgWarner. This is Ron's last earnings call with the company and I wanted to take a moment to personally thank him for his tremendous contribution over the years to our company. I speak for the entire management team in wishing Ron well in future career opportunities.","So, thank you, Ron. All the best. Good luck. And with that, I turn the call over to you.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you, Fr\u00e9d, and good morning, everyone. Before I review the financial details, I'd like to provide you some of the highlights as I see them for the quarter. First, our organic revenue over market was better than our expectations. The lower overall organic growth was the result of lower industry volumes. However, we still outgrew the industry volume by more than 600 basis points.","Second, incremental margin performance was negatively impacted by the rapid decline in industry volumes, which when combined with the temporary nature of the European volume weakness, limited our ability to reduce cost within the quarter. And finally, EPS was at the high end of our guidance we provided last month. Now, as Pat mentioned, I will be referring to supplemental financial slide deck that is posted on our website and I also encourage you to follow along.","Let's turn to slide 11. On a reported basis, sales were up 2.6%, and on a comparable basis, our organic sales were up 3.6%. This is solid performance compared to our weighted average light vehicle industry production for the quarter, which was down approximately 3% year-over-year. We saw 4% growth in China against a production market that was down more than 4%. Europe revenue was down 2% compared to the 6% industry production decline in the quarter. North America revenue was up double-digits versus the 2% production growth in the quarter, and commercial vehicle was a benefit, contributing about 50 basis points of our growth. And diesel and gas mix in Western Europe was a headwind.","Now, let's look at the year-over-year comparison for operating income which can be found on slide 12. Q3 adjusted operating profit was $293 million compared to $297 million in Q3 of 2017. Our operating margin of 11.7% was 50 basis point decline year-over-year due to the impact of Sevcon and higher R&D spending as a percentage of sales. On a comparable basis, operating income was up $6 million on $88 million of higher sales. That gives us an increment margin of 7% in the quarter which is below our mid-teens target.","There are three main drivers of this weaker incremental margin performance. First, the rapid decline in industry volumes which when combined with the tempering nature of European volume weakness did limit our ability to reduce costs within the quarter. R&D timing related to new launches distorted our margin performance in the quarter as well, and raw material and tariff-related costs and inflation impacted us. Earnings per share on reported basis where at $0.98 per share, on an adjusted basis, net earnings were $1 per diluted share.","Now, let's take a closer look at our operating segments in the quarter beginning on slide 13 of the deck. Engine segment net sales were $1.516 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the Engine segment on a comparable basis was 2.1% as growth in North America was offset by lower China volumes. Adjusted EBIT was $238 million for the Engine segment or 15.7% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Engine segment adjusted EBIT was up $5 million on $32 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 17%. This incremental margin performance is partially driven by better performance in our noncore emissions business.","Turning to slide 14, Drivetrain segment net sales were $977 million in the quarter. Sales growth for the Drivetrain segment on a comparable basis was 6.3% primarily due to strong DCT growth in China, transmission components and all-wheel drive. Growth was partially mitigated by lower volumes in European customers were higher than average Drivetrain content. Adjusted EBIT was $108 million for the Drivetrain segment or 11% of sales. Sevcon had a 60 basis point negative impact on margins. On a comparable basis, the Drivetrain segment adjusted EBIT was up $2 million on $58 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of just 4%. This was driven by limited European cost reduction due to the temporary volume decline and timing of R&D spending for awarded programs.","Now, I'd like to discuss our 2018 full year guidance. Turning to sales growth guidance for the full year on slide 16, we expect organic growth of 4.5% to 5.5%, which is consistent with last month's update. The Sevcon acquisition is expected to add approximately $57 million to revenue in 2018, currency is expected to be a $192 million tailwind, and total revenue is expected to be in the range of $10.48 billion to $10.58 billion. Our operating income walk is on slide 17. From a performance perspective, we expect mid-teens incremental margins on our sales growth. Our consolidated operating income margin is expected to be 12.3% to 12.4% or flattish year-over-year.","To finish our full year guidance, please turn to slide 18. EPS guidance range of $4.35 to $4.40 per diluted share is unchanged from last month. We continue to target free cash flow of $550 million to $575 million; however, working capital pressures and tax payments will present a challenge in achieving this target. That being said, this is our goal and we are continuing to drive for this target. The tax rate is still expected to be in the low-26% range.","Now, our fourth quarter guidance is on slide 20. Our guidance range for Q4 is wider than typical, which reflects the continued industry volume uncertainty we see through year end. First sales; we expect organic growth of 1% to 4.5%. EPS is expected to be in a range of $1.07 to $1.12. This guidance is based on a low-26% tax rate and incorporates a $75 million FX revenue headwind year-over-year.","So, now let me summarize Q3. Overall, execution was solid in light of the challenging industry volumes. Like we mentioned before, organic sales growth of 3.6% was more than 600 basis points over industry production. The Q3 incremental margin of 7% was explained by the pace of revenue slow growth and R&D timing to support awarded programs. As we look at the remainder of 2018, the environment will remain challenging. However, we have an experienced team in place to react to these changes while still positioning the company for its future growth.","Now, before I turn it over to Pat, I'd like to say a few things. First, BorgWarner is in an extremely strong position to compete in the coming electrification trend in powertrain. We have an outstanding portfolio of products. I have never seen this company stronger.","Next, I would like to thank many people as I retire from BorgWarner. I'd like to thank the board of directors for their support over the years, and especially our Chairman. I would also like to thank the investment community from the buy and sell-side analysts who I've met over the years, in addition to the advisors from the accounting firms to the bankers.","Also, I owe a big thank you for all the BWA employees, but even a bigger thank you to my finance staff, who I think are the most talented, humble and hard working group around. And I have a big endorsement goes out to Tom McGill, who has been a loyal Treasurer for me, and I have no doubt that his leadership alongside with Fr\u00e9d will continue to deliver the results expected by our investors. And finally, my most important thank you goes out to my wife Tina, who without her support, none of this would have been possible.","So, with that, I'd like to turn it over to Pat.","Patrick Nolan - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you, Ron. Sharon, we're ready to open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from Richard Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","Good morning, Rich.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Good morning, Rich.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, Ron. Best wishes.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you, Rich.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Enjoy it. So, on China, down 4% for the market; you were up 4%, so 8 points outgrowth. Obviously, this past quarter was pretty sudden in terms of the changes to schedules, et cetera. If we just take a step back and think about growth rate in that market, which had been double-digits in a little better production environment, but if we think about kind of a flattish production environment, what should we be thinking with what you know with regards to backlog, et cetera and mix, what we \u2013 should be thinking about outgrowth for that market for you?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","So, thanks, Rich. So, first of all, in Q3, China was a positive contributor. But first half of the year was ahead of the plan, and I think China also fixed a little bit of inventory for us, but still the new business growth is really, really significant for us. And going forward, I think you can expect double-digit over market in China.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. So, no backing off of that with regards to what you see right now...","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","No.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","...particular side, okay.","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","No.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then, just on \u2013 so, we're all square on tariffs. Last quarter, you talked about 10% to 20% in terms of impact, I think Ron did. Is that still playing out as envisioned? And then, if we're starting to think about 2019, any incremental impact from List 3? And then, I assume there's some lap over negative impact for 2019, but just if you could level set us there, I'd appreciate it.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","All right. Rich, I'll do 2018 and Fr\u00e9d will talk about 2019. You're correct that $10 million to $20 million of headwind in tariffs. We did see approximately about $10 million of headwinds in Q3 related to tariffs. So, I feel that we're still on track for what we've communicated \u2013 I think it was last month. I think in Q4, we'd probably continue to see about another $10 million of headwind in tariffs \u2013 and inflation, we kind of combine those together. And then, Fr\u00e9d?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","Right. So, for 2019, one way to look at it is that we certainly see that pretty much in line. For 2018, we have a low recovery, and we are focused into working with our customers to get more recovery than zero. And so, that's going to be our focus going forward in 2019.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So, the way to think about this is, once we get into 2019, the impact should be less than $10 million a quarter (22:53).","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","We might see a little bit more tariffs going forward, because I think it might be the beginning of the impact, but we also think that our focus into getting some recovery is going to compensate some of those increases.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. All right. And then real quick, last one on return of capital with the stock, where it is, given where we are in the cycle, what are the latest thoughts there?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","I would say, Rich, at this point, we're going to reevaluate that going into the 2019 plan, that will be communicated in the first quarter, because at this point, we're finished with the $150 million buybacks that we did for 2018. But we'll be up \u2013 the opportunities are there, we're going to take them. There's no question. But we'll have to communicate exactly what that buy is going to be as we go into the first quarter, okay?","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. Thanks, again, Ron.","Operator","Your next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks very much. Good morning and Ron, congratulations on your retirement. It's been great working with you.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","So, just to pick up on the question that Rich was asking about, he was looking at the tariffs and materials side. You talked earlier about basically inability to or decision not to moderate spending in view of what we saw as EU temporary weakness. So, I just want to understand what is your view to how long that kind of WLTP really weakness lasts? Should we see a short-term continued pressure on margins in view of that and how long do you think it lasts?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","So, our view is that it's essentially a second half of 2018 impact and it's certainly going to carry on in Q4. And we also think that the volumes that have been lost in 2018 might not be recovered in 2019. But going forward, we'll do a better job in fixing costs to reduction of volume overall. Now, I think in Europe, early-2019 what we know is that it might actually be back to normal.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then, Fr\u00e9d, you talked about strong win rates across propulsion types. We've seen some peers recently stepping up a bit or talking about stepping up their inorganic spend in electrification and I think that certainly validates some of the earlier moves you've made. But just any changes you might be seeing in the competitive environment? Any risk at this point you see to kind of expected product margins on the hybrid and electric side?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","No, we don't. We're very, very successful in booking business on hybrids and electrics. And what Ron and I see when we get these requests for capital installment, we don't see any changes in margin going forward. So, we're very pleased with the booking rate. It remains strong across combustion, hybrid and electric. And there are many booked items that we can't disclose, as you may imagine, but we don't see any things changing from what we've told you in the past which is pretty much the same margins and capital intensity and return on capital.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. Perfect. I'll jump back in queue. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Leiker with Baird.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","Good morning, David.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Good morning, David.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","And Ron, likewise, congratulations.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you, David.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Look forward to it. Fr\u00e9d, as we look at WLTP in Europe, I know it would be bouncing around a couple of different ways, but do you have a sense of your customers, what share of their vehicles they have gotten certified here as of the end of October, and what's left to go yet?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","No, I don't. I don't have that detail.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. But from what you're seeing, that's something that should be \u2013 everyone should be pretty close to caught up by the end of the Q4?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","I think it's getting better. In Europe, we don't have views of inventories. And so, I think they still have some work to do, but I \u2013 we're not in those \u2013 we don't have those info. We don't \u2013 we're not in those types of details, David.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then, on China, since you updated your guidance going into your Investor Day, it's gotten weaker. There are some talks here in October of even a more severe weakening, double-digit-type declines. Just, what are your \u2013 it sounds \u2013 I mean, what you have in your numbers, in your guidance, and that double-digit kind of decline carried into next year, anyway you can characterize what that might mean for you?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","So, you're right. There is a lot of volatility. This is why we have kind of wide top line Q4 guidance, and I don't want to comment for next year, but we think that we are seeing public forecast a little bit on the optimistic side. If you see the car registration in September, it's down double-digit. So, we're protecting for a bit of that and it's difficult to forecast short-term, but, yeah, we see that market is going down and that's why we have that wide range of guidance. (29:21).","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then, one last item here. As we look at the sub-comment in the power electronics business and your work, I don't think you've booked anything on the automotive side yet on power electronics. But where are you on developing that product portfolio in the bid activity and opportunities for win there?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. We are absolutely on track. Sevcon is focused into playing in our iDM, so integrated Drive Module. That's their focus. As you know, on battery electric vehicle, we have transmissions. We also have transmission and motor as we've announced with Great Wall. And the next step for us is to develop and manufacture an integrated Drive Module including power electronics, that's the focus of Sevcon, and we are absolutely on track for doing that.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","So, what do you think the timing is for you to be in a position to announce your first win with the power electronics business?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","It might be a little bit early for commenting on the date, but we're getting there. It's a very high focus of ours.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you, David.","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great, guys. Thanks for getting us on and taking our questions today. I just wanted to follow-up on that. So, to be clear, your eDM doesn't have any power electronics embedded in it, the eDM (31:02)?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","So, we have two types of product, Dave. We have the eDM, which is motor and transmission, and we have the iDM, which is power electronics, motor and transmission. The eDM is in production. The iDM is in development.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, I guess for my follow-up, as you looked at the China production schedules and kind of thought back to the guidance that you put out in September 18 of this year, how much \u2013 or how weak did you really fully expect that China industry to go? And what are you seeing from an inventory level of your customers' end market supply and if there's any risk to your views in the back \u2013 or at least the last quarter of the year?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","So, as I mentioned in my opening comments, we have a wide range, 1% to 4.5%. When we looked at the guide that we did on September 18, it was due to two things: WLTP and China. WLTP and China was pretty much half and half for Q3 and Q4. And so far, even if I have already commented, we think we're going to be between the midpoint and the low-end of the guide, we don't see a change from what we guided back a month ago.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you, gentlemen.","Operator","Next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Good morning, guys, and Ron, congratulations. I look forward to staying in touch, hopefully.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you, John.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Fr\u00e9d, as you went through page 9 and talked about $14 billion as still the goal for 2023, you kind of had a heavy emphasis saying that that didn't include acquisitions. I'm just curious, given some of the stuff that's going on more recently with the KKR acquisition of Magneti Marelli \u2013 or the announcement of acquisition, if you're seeing any of this M&A activity heating up, either on a smaller or larger basis, and that may be a real opportunity for you in the future?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. So, the $14 billion is without any M&A. And John, we're always active on the M&A front. We have a team of great people focused on optimizing our product portfolio, making proposals for M&A \u2013 small, medium or big M&A \u2013 and this is something we will always focus on. Technology is always a key. M&A is always focused on, for us, for product leadership. And so, this is the direction we're marching towards.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. When you say big, though, what does that mean? I mean, usually we've been hearing about sort of smaller stuff. What does big mean? Same size as Borg or is it half the size? What does that mean?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","Small is small, medium is bigger than small, and big is bigger than medium.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Borg is huge.","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","And Borg is huge.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Okay. So, in the context of that, Borg is huge, in the context of that small, medium, big, is that a fair statement?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","It's a fair statement.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Then, just one quick follow-up, and Ron just because you're the numbers guy and you used to talk about this stuff. I mean, when we think about margin expansion, it used to be you needed high-single-digit to low-double-digit top line growth to get margin expansion. Has the equation changed when you look at sort of mid-single-digit top line growth, you may still be able to eke out a little bit of margin expansion? Is there sort of a new formula here that you guys might be able to sort of illustrate for folks, so we can understand sort of the rough math around margins versus top line?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. There's a couple of ways to look at this. First of all, John, you've been around for a long time and it was communicated that you needed about 8%, 9% growth to get margin expansion. I think we've proved as a company, we've lowered that point to probably, say, 4%, 5% growth. And actually, if you had taken a look at this quarter and some of those headwinds weren't there, we probably would have expanded margins as well at the 3% to 4% growth.","I would say this, though: that mid-teens is more over a range of time as well. So, when you look at changes in volume in short order, it's a little bit harder to adjust your cost structure to get margin expansion, which happened to us in the third quarter. But I would say that this company right here is operating in a range where we can get margin expansion at the lower end, say, to this 3%, 4%, 4.5% growth. That's where we're operating right now. But you can't have rapid declines in volume like we saw in Q3. So, we've lowered that bar from like back in the days to be 8% to 9% to more about 3% to 4%. We can still expand margins.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And thanks for pointing out that I've been around for a while, Ron. I appreciate that. Thanks. So, thanks very much. Congratulations, buddy. Take care.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Colin Langan with UBS.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Just want to like everyone else said, congratulations, Ron, on your retirement.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Can you just touchback on \u2013 I think I missed the first question on China tariff, what can you do if the tariff go from 10% to 25% next year? I mean, how should we think about that impact and what kind of mitigation actions might be possible?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","So, we're focused on that. We have plans in place. We have several mitigation actions \u2013 localizing, resourcing, sharing, passing it along to our customers some of it. So, we have a view on what we need to do and we have plans in place if that will happen.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","And I mean, do you think you can execute those plans fairly quickly or should we think about that sort of \u2013 I think it would be like $20 million to $40 million annualized for this year. Does that more than double if it goes to 25%?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","So, those resourcing plans would take time. There will be negotiation with customers on validation periods. So, the $20 million that you've seen in 2018, we've incurred that all our own. We've not passed anything through. Discussions take time and are happening. So, when tariff increases or when we see a bigger impact of what's already enacted, we also think that we can be successful in closing some negotiation with our customers.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. And I apologize if I missed this as well, but any color on the weak incremental in the Drivetrain margin of just 4%, if we look slide 14?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. I had that comment in my remarks. It's a combination of R&D spending and \u2013 what's the other item?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","Europe.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Europe. I'm sorry, (38:48). So, the rapid decline in the volumes, we didn't take any cost out, because we saw them as temporary in Europe. So, we didn't respond and take cost out. And as we saw it, the term we use in accounting is lack of absorption basically in our plants. And as Fr\u00e9d was saying earlier, we see that as a temporary thing in Europe. So, we do fully expect that our fourth quarter incremental margin to come back to a more reasonable level.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","And why don't you see that in Engine?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Engine, we get a tailwind little bit from the noncore emissions business as well. Remember, last year, there was a tremendous headwind on the Engine side, and this year, we're seeing a little bit more tailwind. And R&D spending was more heavily rated to the Drivetrain as well. So, Engine had a good incremental margin primarily because of the tailwinds of the emissions business or the thermostat business we're trying to sell.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And then just lastly, it sounds like you have a pretty broad range in your guidance anyway. But any color on the sensitivity to China production if we see it come in \u2013 I think IHS has it flat if it comes in down 1% for the year. What would that mean in terms of your risk?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","So, as I mentioned before, we have a wide range of guide. We've protected for some downturn. I suggest Pat can follow-up with you on that particular question, if you like.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. All right. Well, thanks for taking my question.","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thanks, Colin.","Operator","Next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays.","Stephen Hunt - Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.","Yes. Hi. Good morning, team. This is actually Stephen Hunt on for Brian. Ron, congrats on retirement and your future opportunities, I wish you the best. Just want to drilldown a little bit on European light vehicle here. So, Europe light vehicle production was down 5% in the quarter. Just wondering if you guys can provide any color on Borg's outperformance or in line performance, not sure what it was in the quarter.","And then, also as we think about the supply chain from (41:03) standpoint as we think about each OEMs that you're serving and how to think about kind of from a manufacturing just-in-time standpoint delivery, et cetera. How tie are you guys to each individual plant versus kind of just overall levels of production in Europe? And then, I've a couple follow-up questions.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","So, before Fr\u00e9d, let me just start give you some of the numbers on \u2013 in my script. I was saying that we saw negative 2% growth in Europe where the market was negative 6%. I think you asked about China. China, we saw, was up \u2013 we said China 2% growth on a market that was down about 4%. So, just on the numbers side, all right? So, Fr\u00e9d?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","No. It's absolutely right. It's consistent with the fact that regularly we overgrow or outgrow the market by 500 basis points to 600 basis points. So, in Q3, it was closer to 600 basis points and a little bit more. But this outgrowing the market is where we want to be, and you see that in Q3 and also you see that in our longer-term guide.","Stephen Hunt - Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.","Okay. And then, just any color on \u2013 because you guys are pretty close to WLTP right now. Just wondering from supply chain manufacturing standpoint, particularly as we think about the differences between kind of the transmission versus trends in the Drivetrain versus the Engine, how to think about kind of Borg's positioning as you think through kind of the next couple months and get through these WLTP issues? Just wondering if there's any key differences in how to think about maybe OEM's ability to stock up or build more engines or drivetrains, et cetera, through the WLTP. Any color you could provide on that would be helpful.","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","It's tough for us to have that detail. We don't see a lot of impact \u2013 or differences between the Engine side of the business and the Drivetrain side of the business regarding call offs. We also think that progress are being made by the carmakers on getting this done and \u2013 yeah, for sure, it's going to impact Q4, but having a longer term view is a little bit difficult for us. But to your questions, we don't see any impact between Engine and Drivetrain.","Stephen Hunt - Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.","Yeah, understood. Okay. Good. And then just one last housekeeping one, free cash flow, it sounds like there's some potential downside to that due to working capital and tax payments. Just wondering if you can kind of quantify \u2013 roughly quantify what the downside could potentially look like. And then also, as you think heading into 2019, is it just a one-time thing that's going to reverse, so to speak, into 2019 or is that kind of ongoing?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","I'm not going to quantify the headwinds. All we're going to say is that given some customer responses we saw at the end of Q3, we're anticipating some of our customers may short pay us a little bit in the fourth quarter. And we're going to make sure that we do everything, given them phone calls to make sure they don't do that. We just want to make everybody know that there are some challenges in hitting the free cash flow target at this point. 2019 is too early right now, Stephen, to say anything. They'll have to come out in the first quarter when we provide guidance. But it is kind of on a temporary basis I would say. Our working capital is temporary.","Stephen Hunt - Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.","Okay.","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","The focus on free cash flow and working capital and CapEx is very central, and we're certainly marching towards our $1 billion free cash flow in 2023.","Stephen Hunt - Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.","Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","And we have a question from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Ron, all the best as well from me.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Hey, Joe.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Fr\u00e9d, maybe just bigger picture, at the Analyst Day and in the past, you've sort of mentioned that the sweet spot for you from a content perspective is really on the plug-in hybrids. Near-term, right, with some of the WLTP rulings and I think some of the credits to some of the countries as well, it seems there has been a step back from that. Are you seeing that? And I guess specifically with the WLTP stuff, are you seeing any sort of change in how customers are thinking about plug-in hybrids as they begin to source next-generation platforms?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","No. I don't see any changes. Hybrid is, for sure, a great product for us. It adds content. We have two times more content on the hybrid than on the combustion propulsion architecture, so \u2013 and we don't see any slowdown in any parts of the world in going towards hybrids. P2, for sure, but also other technologies that we can support, so it's still a great story for us, we're booking hybrids to plan, and the overweight strategy on hybrids and electric is taking shape.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then, from the near-term impact on maybe some customers pulling plug-in hybrids that doesn't impact you that much, because really that's more in your bookings than in your base business?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.","You're right.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay.

Fred will conclude with a discussion of our recent product highlights. Then Tom McGill, our Controller, will discuss the details of our results as well as our guidance. Also with us today is Kevin Nowlan, our recently appointed CFO. Please note that we have posted an earnings call presentation to the IR page of our website. We encourage you to follow along with these slides during our discussion.","With that, I'll turn it over to Fred.","Frederic Lissalde","Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased to share our results from Q1 2019 today and provide an overall company update. Before we begin, I'd like to welcome Kevin Nowlan to his first earnings call with BorgWarner as our new CFO. Kevin's impressive background speaks for itself. But suffice it to say, his experience will be invaluable as we continue our long legacy of strong financial discipline. He hit the ground running during his first few weeks, and you will be hearing more from him in the coming months.","I also like to thank Tom McGill for his excellent financial leadership, and I'm very pleased that he is now our Controller with responsibilities for all our accounting, tax and enterprise risk management operations.","Now I'll start by sharing a few thoughts on the industry shown on Slide 5, starting with Q1. The global light vehicle production came down about 5.2%, which is more than 100 basis points better than the midpoint of our expectation going into the quarter. In addition, I'm very proud to say that our outgrowth in Q1 was also stronger than expected, driven by higher volume of new programs, especially in Europe and North America. European light vehicle production was down about 5.5% as customers worked through the final stages of the WLTP certification. China light vehicle production was down mid-teens year-over-year as our customers reacted to lower demand and reduced their inventories. North American light vehicle industry production declined about 2.5% year-over-year. ","Now looking to the remainder of 2019. We expect that the challenging conditions in China and Europe will continue for the remainder of the year. Even with these challenging conditions, we expect to be able to deliver on our full year earnings and cash flow guidance. On a full year basis, we continue to expect a market decline in the minus 2% to minus 5% range. At the midpoint of our guide, we're factoring in China down high single digits, Europe down more than 3% and North America down more than 2%. The key is that we expect to continue to outgrow the market in 2019 based on continuous strong demand for our products.","Let me now move to Slide 6. First, a brief summary of our Q1 results. Overall, I'm very pleased. Organic growth was above our guidance. And while we fell short of our typical 20% decremental margin, the performance was in line with our Q1 guide. With $2.6 billion in sales, we were down 3.3% organically. This compares to our market being down approximately 5.2%, so our outgrowth was approximately 200 basis points in the quarter, which was ahead of our expectations. ","Regionally, our China revenue declined high teens as ramp-up schedules of new programs were impacted by inventory reduction at our customers. Our European light vehicle revenue was down about 1%, outperforming the industry decline. Our North American light vehicle revenue was flattish year-over-year, and our commercial vehicle off-road and aftermarket business was also flat year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per share came at $1, which was ahead of our guidance, driven by revenue outperformance.","Now for the full year 2019. Whilst we are encouraged by the stronger Q1 performance, we're maintaining our full year guidance. We continue to expect revenue to be down 2.5% to up 2% organically, and this represents an outgrowth of 250 basis points to 400 basis points over our expected market decline. We continue to expect our adjusted earnings per share to be at $4 to $4.35. ","I would also like to briefly touch on our planned margin and R&D cadence for 2019. As Tom will explain later, our guidance for Q2 implies a shortfall compared to our typical decremental margin. In addition to the costs related to tariffs and supply bankruptcies, we're also supporting elevated R&D spending in Q2. This is mostly related to the recently awarded programs. ","The prototype spending for this program is a bit lumpy throughout 2019, with some of the largest impacts in Q2. For example, during this quarter, we will experience a $10 million year-over-year impact from prototype spending related to recent complete module awards for P2 hybrids. However, at the high level, our R&D spending expectations for 2019 remain unchanged.","We continue to deliver strong outgrowth in 2019, and we must continuously look at ways to adjust our cost structure without compromising our long-term aspiration. The cost restructuring plan that we announced in our press release this morning is consistent with this long-term commitment. We've taken a company-wide view of areas to reduce our current cost structure. Based on our analysis, we believe that we can achieve a $40 million to $50 million annual improvement in our current structural cost over the next 2 years. These cost actions will range from capacity realignment, efficiency improvement in SG&A expenses within our businesses and cost reduction opportunities within our corporate overhead. We expect these actions will result in restructuring expenses in the $80 million to $100 million range through the end of 2020.","Our plan is to really deploy these savings into spending to support future growth in hybrid and electric propulsion. Specifically, we expect to use savings to increase our R&D spending as a percentage of sales without negatively impacting our overall operating margins.","We continue to see a strong pool for our products from our customers. And we expect the return on this higher spending will not only drive stronger growth, but generate returns in line with our historic levels.","Now I'd like to discuss some of our recent product successes, which are on Slide 7. For the second year in a row, BorgWarner has been recognized as an Automotive News PACE Awards winner. This year, we won for our revolutionary dual volute turbocharger for gasoline engines. General Motors is the first OEM to put this innovative technology in its full-size pickups with its 4-cylinder turbocharge engine. This is a great example of technology that will help support our above-market growth in the combustion propulsion.","In hybrid, we also announced that a major European commercial vehicle manufacturer has chosen our HVH410 electric motor for plug-in hybrid electric truck to be announced in 2019. I'm also strongly encouraged by our year-to-date wins across multiple hybrid architectures and electric products.","Before I turn it over to Tom, let me summarize my opening remarks. Q1 was a strong start of the year, and we feel very confident in our full year outlook. Our cost restructuring plan will help support our future profitable growth while sustaining margin performance. And the year-to-date new business wins that we've achieved across combustion, hybrid and electric vehicle will position us strongly for the future.","Now let me turn it over to Tom.","Thomas McGill","Thank you, Fred. Good morning, everyone. Before I review the financial details, I would like to provide you some of the highlights as I see them for the quarter. First, our outgrowth was better than expected at 190 basis points. This, combined with a more modest decline in industry volume, allowed us to deliver a stronger top line sales performance.","Second, decremental margin performance was below our long-term targets, but the shortfall was in line with our expectations going into the quarter. As a result, the stronger sales from the quarter flowed through in line with our long-term incremental margin expectations. And finally, we are maintaining our guidance for the year, but feel increasingly confident in our earnings and free cash flow outlook for the full year.","Let's turn to Slide 9. On a comparable basis, our organic sales were down 3.3% year-over-year. This is solid performance compared to market, which was down approximately 5.2% year-over-year. We saw a high-teens decline in China against a production market that was down mid-teens. Europe revenue was down 1% compared to the 5.5% industry production decline in the quarter. North America revenue was flat versus the 2.5% production decline in the quarter, and our commercial vehicle and aftermarket business was flat year-over-year.","So now let's look at the year-over-year comparison for adjusted operating income, which can be found on Slide 10. The Q1 adjusted operating income was $295 million compared to $339 million in Q1 of '18. Our adjusted operating margin of 11.5% was down versus 12.2% last year. On a comparable basis, adjusted operating income was down $29 million or $91 million of lower sales. This gives us the decremental margin of 32% in the quarter, which is worse than our long-term decremental margin target of 20%. This $11 million shortfall compared to a 20% decremental margin can be explained by tariff-related costs, supplier bankruptcy costs in Europe and timing of costs related to a new business launch later in 2019. Our earnings per share on a reported basis were $0.77 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis, net earnings were $1 per diluted share. ","Now let's take a closer look at our operating segments in the quarter beginning on Slide 11 of the deck. The reported Engine segment net sales were $1.6 billion in the quarter. On a comparable basis, sales for the Engine segment declined 1.8% as growth in North America was offset by lower Europe and China volumes. Adjusted EBIT was $241 million for the Engine segment or 15.1% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Engine segment's adjusted EBIT was down $28 million on $31 million of lower sales. This week, decremental margin performance was driven by the decline in sales and costs related to supplier bankruptcies.","So turning to Slide 12, the Drivetrain segment net sales were $982 million in the quarter. On a comparable basis, sales for the Drivetrain segment declined 5.6% year-over-year, primarily due to lower volumes on European customers with higher-than-average Drivetrain content and on low volumes of recently launched new programs in China. Adjusted EBIT was $105 million for the Drivetrain segment or 10.7% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Drivetrain segment's adjusted EBIT was down $12 million on $61 million of lower sales for a decremental margin of 20%.","So now I'd like to discuss our 2019 full year guidance, which is unchanged. So turning to the sales growth guidance for the full year on Slide 14, our guidance is based on market assumption of down 2% to down 5%. We expect an organic revenue change of down negative 2.5% to positive 2.0% or 250 to 400 basis points of outgrowth over the market. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $9.9 billion to $10.37 billion. ","Our adjusted operating income walk is on Slide 15. Our consolidated adjusted operating income margin is expected to be flat to down in 2019, and this margin performance is due to the decline in sales year-over-year, combined with costs related to tariffs, supplier bankruptcy costs in Europe and changes to launch timing throughout 2019.","To finish up our full year guidance, please turn to Slide 16. Our adjusted EPS guidance range is unchanged at $4 to $4.35 per diluted share. We continue to target free cash flow of $550 million to $600 million. And our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 26%.","Our second quarter guidance is on Slide 18. So first, sales. We expect organic sales to be in the range of down 2.5%to flat year-over-year. This would represent an outgrowth of 350 to 400 basis points versus our market forecast of down 4% to 6%. The sequential improvement in our outgrowth is expected to be driven by recovery in volumes of new programs in China and newly launched programs in North America.","Adjusted EPS for Q2 is expected to be in the range of $0.99 to $1.05 per diluted share, and our Q2 guidance is based on a 26% effective tax rate and incorporates $100 million of FX revenue headwind year-over-year.","As Fred indicated earlier, our guidance for Q2 implies roughly a $20 million operating income shortfall compared to our typical incremental and decremental margin performance.","And as with the case in Q1, the Q2 results will be impacted by tariffs and supplier bankruptcy costs. And in addition, higher R&D spending will impact our year-over-year margin performance in the quarter. But most of this impact was timing-related, and the largest impact is related to recently awarded programs. The prototype spending for these programs is a bit lumpy throughout 2019 with some of the largest impacts in Q2. On a full year basis, we still feel comfortable that the R&D will be in the low 4% range, but timing of spending will vary from quarter-to-quarter. Specifically, we expect our Q4 R&D spending to be $10 million to $20 million less than the Q2 levels.","So in conclusion, let me summarize Q1 and our outlook. Overall, execution was solid in light of the challenging industry volume. Organic sales decline of 3.3% was better than our expectations. Decremental margin performance in the quarter was in line with our expectations. And as we look into the remainder of 2019, we remain confident in the reacceleration of our outgrowth and our ability to achieve both our earnings and cash flow guidance. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat.","Patrick Nolan","Thank you, Tom. Sharon, we're ready to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John Murphy","Just wanted to ask a first question on your sort of the step-up in R&D versus the restructuring actions. I'm just curious, I mean, as you're thinking about this, are the restructuring actions being taken because there's some potential underperformance that you're seeing in things that need to be fixed or is the direct motivation to fund a step-up- in R&D going forward, and it really will be almost a 1-for-1 offset? Just trying to understand what's going on there between the two.","Frederic Lissalde","I think it's both, John. We asked to adjust our cost structure to the latest industry evolutions, and we then are going to focus on our growth and also make sure that our operating margin evolutions are in line with what we've announced and what we committed to. So it's both, John. It's absolutely both. So we're taking a company-wide view to reduce the cost structure. And at the end of the day, the pool is there from our customers, and we see growth potential that require R&D. I think those two things have to be done, and we're doing it. We're executing it, and we'll execute it. And that's going to be good for profitable growth for the company.","John Murphy","So should we think about the $40 million or $50 million of ongoing cost saves would be directly offset by a step-up in R&D that should drive sales, which should keep R&D as a percentage of sales roughly in the low 4% range? Is that a sort of a logic that's correct? Or am I missing something?","Frederic Lissalde","No, your logic is correct. The R&D would be up a little more than that, and that would be topping 2020, 2021. Don't consider that the R&D that is currently at 4.1% of sales in 2019 is going to change. And also the margin profile expectations are going to be unchanged.","John Murphy","Okay. And then if I could just sneak in a follow-up. Just on this Slide 10, Fred, and maybe for you, Tom, as well. I mean, as you're going through the tariffs impact, the supplier bankruptcy and the new launches as headwinds to your decremental margins or sort of losses to decremental margins, are those relatively equal? Or how should we think about the three of those as we go through the course of '19 and potentially into 2020?","Frederic Lissalde","Are you talking about full year?","John Murphy","Well, I mean, in the quarter, but then, also, it sounds like they're going to persist a little bit in the second quarter. So I just want to understand what are the sort of the buckets of those? Were they equally split in the first quarter? And is that the same allocation we should think about going forward? Or is there something changing going forward?","Thomas McGill","Yes. So with the tariffs, we've talked about that being up to maybe $10 million a quarter, and that will continue through Q2. And then come Q3, that year-over-year comparison, the tariffs will be in both. So again, a little bit in Q2, but by Q3, the year-over-year will even out. For the supplier bankruptcies, yes, that will continue in Q3 and probably through the year, but we'll see that coming down in Q3 and Q4, especially on a comparable basis.","Frederic Lissalde","And for R&D in Q2, John, it's about $10 million, and it's timing.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research.","Rod Lache","A couple of things. To make the full year number, it implies that the second-half margins are in the 12.5% range after the mid-11s in the first half. And it sounds like part of this is moderation of R&D, and part of it is the supplier bankruptcies. And I presume that you're also anticipating easier comps in European production, but I was hoping you might be able to just elaborate a little bit more on each of these components and how we should be thinking about that because it's pretty unusual to see BorgWarner have stronger back-half margins versus first half.","Frederic Lissalde","So one is related to R&D timing. We have Q4 R&D, which is $10 million to $20 million lower than Q2. And also you have a stronger growth in the second half of the year which is linked to stronger backlog and demand of our products for Europe and North America, but also in the second half of the year, and we see that starting in Q2 in China.","Rod Lache","What's the bankruptcy part of this? And what are you assuming for European production in the back half?","Frederic Lissalde","So our midpoint to European production is estimated at a little bit less than -- let's say, down more than 3%. And to give you an idea, on the supplier side, we consider that the bankruptcy costs and everything that we have to go through is about $5 million a quarter.","Rod Lache","Okay, okay. And then secondly, I know that you're...","Frederic Lissalde","Which is the supplier bankruptcies started last year. So there's $5 million of growth that we'll start lapping in the second half.","Rod Lache","Okay, got you. Secondly, I know your backlog is bigger, I mean, your business backlog is bigger in 2020 versus 2019, but I don't think that either of those backlog numbers incorporate any changes in mix in Europe. And the reason I'm asking is, obviously, a lot needs to happen for European OEMs to go from 120 grams of CO2 per kilometer down to 95 over the next year or so. So do you -- just setting aside the macro issues and thinking about your business in Europe, do you see an additional net positive from mix coming in here as some OEMs eliminate some of the lower-performing models from a CO2 perspective? Just generally, what are you hearing from your customers as you look out to the next year or so as far as their plans for CO2 compliance?","Frederic Lissalde","So you're right. But again, when you look at our European backlog, you need to factor back about 10% of our overall backlog linked to the diesel mix. And the other thing that you're going to see longer term is that I think you're going to see a very, very positive push for hybrid propulsion architecture post 2020. This is also one of the reasons why you've got an acceleration of the backlog in 2020 linked to those new launches.","Rod Lache","But do you see, just from a mix perspective -- forgetting about backlog, do you see a shift towards more a kind of higher BorgWarner content of vehicles in 2020 versus what you're just seeing right now simply because these automakers need to shift to their -- to better CO2 compliance?","Frederic Lissalde","In the short term not in a meaningful way.","Operator","Next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer.","Noah Kaye","So can you talk more about the factors that led you to conclude that higher investment in hybrid and EV products were necessary? Does this contemplate a faster mix shift towards electrification than you saw previously? If so, why?","Frederic Lissalde","Because the customers are in high demand and because we're winning.","Noah Kaye","Can you expand on that a little bit?","Frederic Lissalde","Well, yes. I mean, we have technologies from a hybrid perspective that are being pulled by our customers in different architecture, in different regions of the world, especially in China and in Europe. At this point in time, we're winning advanced hybrids in Europe. And we'll just ask -- we're focusing on the long-term profitable growth. The returns are going to be good, and we need to deliver.","Noah Kaye","Okay. Yes. So if I understand that, then this is really R&D supporting an elevated number of launches than maybe we've previously thought? This is not core R&D or some sort of gaps you saw in the portfolio? Am I understanding that right?","Frederic Lissalde","You're right. It's essentially more at new business development application type R&D than, how would you call that, advanced R&D.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.","Mariel Kennedy","This is Mariel Kennedy on for David Tamberrino. Just our first question, looking toward your second quarter guidance, what are your regional production assumptions for the industry?","Frederic Lissalde","So for Q2 regional production for the industry is pretty much North America, slightly down; Europe, down more than 5%; China, down double-digit. And overall, on the global, both on a weighted average, we're pretty much down around 5%.","Mariel Kennedy","Okay. And then just looking at commercial vehicle, it looks like that was just kind of flat in the quarter, where you've been seeing it positive in the past. What sort of expectations do you have for that going forward?","Frederic Lissalde","So when you look at commercial vehicle, our business in commercial vehicle represents about 12% of our revenue. And it's very, very -- we have about 1\/3 of that revenue in the U.S., 1\/3 in Europe and 1\/3 in China and Brazil, China being 2\/3 of that last 1\/3. And we have 60% of our business which is on-road and 40% off-road construction agriculturals. So this business is very, very wide and very spread. And our hypothesis is going into forecasting and is that we are considering it by default flat because of that complexity. So don't attach a Class 8 North America market or industry volume to us. We're way more complex than this.","Mariel Kennedy","Okay. Then just one last question, if I could get it in there. As we're looking, and you have more backlog in hybrids and EVs, are you starting to see any sort of material customer mix shift, especially in China? Or is it still kind of the same as you've seen in the past?","Frederic Lissalde","We don't see a meaningful customer mix change.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore ISI.","Christopher McNally","If I could just follow up to, I think, just one of the questions that have been asked before, particularly Rod's question, around Europe. I mean, if we think about the next two years, where you're talking about sort of an increase in R&D specific for new launches in Europe, can you just give a little bit more color on the type of vehicles that you're getting, maybe increased requests for or maybe volume requests are going up, so that European OEMs can meet the O2, which starts essentially in 2020? Is there still P2 PHEV 48-volt? But are you also seeing some EV programs pull forward for you specifically in Europe?","Frederic Lissalde","Okay. Chris, until 2020, 100% of the business is booked. And the stuff that we're booking right now is past backlog period. It's 2021, 2022. And yes, it's going to be around advanced hybrid. Most of those programs are going to be advanced hybrid, 48-volts and higher voltages, a variety of products.","Christopher McNally","Okay. So is it fair to say that we're not actually seeing volume change? I think there's a view out there that essentially, some of the volumes on some of these programs that need to be increased, the OEMs are going to push them to avoid fines because of a greater-than-expected shortfall that they've seen in, for example, diesel.","Frederic Lissalde","And here you're asking within the next two years, right? Shorter term, right?","Christopher McNally","Yes, exactly.","Frederic Lissalde","Well, shorter term, we can react. If we have the program, we can react. And if they want more volume, we'll react, and we can react pretty fast. The impact of the additional R&D is certainly past 2020.. And, yes, that's what I was saying.","Christopher McNally","Okay, that's perfectly clear. If I could just ask one more on a more near-term basis. As we think about the second, where even, I think, in your assumptions, if Europe is down roughly 5%, 6% in the first half and you have it down 3%, we have a recovery essentially in the second half to get there. And some of that's the easier comps. Can you talk a little bit about RDE in Q3? I think most of the industry was hit with the surprise of WLTP. We're hearing that people are more prepared. Is there any comments that you can get on when schedules for the summer may be more firmed up with respect to the next level of testing in Europe?","Frederic Lissalde","Chris, the way we see it is it that in Europe, for the second half of the year, the market's going to be pretty flat year-over-year. And our hypothesis is that, yes, you're going to -- our customers are going to go through RDE as they went through WLTP last year. And that's our assumption going into the second half of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph Spak","Sorry if I missed this, but just you initially guided the backlog to be effectively 0, and it ended up being about 3.7% to growth. What change that sort of maybe came in that you didn't expect? And how should we think about that as it trends into the second quarter?","Frederic Lissalde","Yes. So in Q1, we guided with no outgrowth to market, and we are effectively outgrowing the market by about 200 basis points. Two major drivers: one is Europe Engine business slightly better; North America, also slightly better. And China was in line, which means no outgrowth.","Joseph Spak","But I thought the commentary previously was that because of sort of the market outlook, some of the launches were maybe going to be delayed. And it seems like maybe some of those launches did come in. So can you maybe sort of, maybe if not customer-specific, like did stuff launch in China that you didn't originally expected? Or where did they come in from?","Frederic Lissalde","So in China, things did not bounce. In China, we were, as I said, in line with our expectations going into Q1. Europe was the driver.","Joseph Spak","Europe? Okay. On -- just maybe to sort of talk about the R&D spending and sort of the electrification program going forward a little bit differently. I think in your backlog, you have 70% allocated towards hybrid. I was wondering if is it possible to sort of disaggregate that 70% to -- from the -- maybe from like the ICE side of the hybrid versus the electric side? And how does that sort of change with the sort of R&D talk beyond this sort of backlog period as it sort of gets to more advanced hybrids?","Frederic Lissalde","We really look at hybrid as an addressable content. And we have, from a hybrid perspective, we have our P2 hybrids. We have P1. We have P3. We have motors. We have -- and past the backlog, we will have power and electric. So it's very difficult to put a number on the combustion side of hybrid or the electric part of hybrid. What is true and what's driving growth, and that's why electrification is great for this company, is that the more advanced hybrid you get, the higher content of vehicle you're going to get from BorgWarner. And that's why electrification accelerates our growth.","Joseph Spak","Okay. And just, I guess, lastly, with the structural costs you're taking out, did you mention specifically what it is? Like are you shuttering capacity for some specific types of products? Or what exactly are you restructuring?","Frederic Lissalde","So as I said, it's a company-wide view, but the largest share is going to be into the engine side. That's where we have to pick, as you saw some of the too heavy decremental. Corporate also will contribute. So we look at it from a holistic approach in order to get that done.","Operator","Next question comes from Colin Langan with UBS.","Colin Langan","Any color -- I mean, the numbers came in better than your guidance for Q1. Any thoughts on why not just tweak up the full year guidance? Or it's just too early in the year out there? Or has something gotten worse than the full year outlook?","Frederic Lissalde","I think it's just too early in the year. The volatility in the market is still here in pretty much all the regions. And I think it's just -- we think it's just too early.","Colin Langan","And I apologize if I missed this. The decrementals were pretty large, particularly in Engine. What were the big issues year-over-year on the quarter?","Thomas McGill","Yes. So this is Tom. So in Engine, well, we have tariffs that impacted both Engine and Drivetrain. In Engine, the supplier bankruptcies in Europe that we talked about were primarily in the Engine Group. And then it was just kind of the launch timing and then the lower volumes that also contributed.","Colin Langan","Got it. And when we're thinking about diesel, I mean, how was that trending? And what are your expectations for this year?","Frederic Lissalde","So the assumption on diesel is that for this year, we assume a 300 basis point shift from last year. And what we also see is that there might be a little bit of a reduction in decreases quarter-over-quarter, 300 basis points down from prior year.","Operator","The next question comes from James Picariello with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","James Picariello","So just on electrification programs in China, hearing farther up the supply chain as it relates to cash flow materials that China EV programs are getting pushed by as much as like 12 to 18 months. We're also seeing cobalt prices come down. So I'm just curious what you're seeing in the China market as it kind of relates to this commentary from another supplier of the supply chain?","Frederic Lissalde","No, that's -- we see no changes at all from our allowance cadence on that electric vehicle propulsion in China. The EV pool is still very strong.","James Picariello","Okay. And just on the timing of the restructuring plan, the $40 million to $50 million in savings by 2021, is that sort of a 50-50 split over next year in '21? Or is it weighted to the -- to later half there? How should we think about that?","Frederic Lissalde","The timing's still being worked out, but it's going to be over the 2 years. We're still working it out, but all of those actions for those savings will be in place by the end of 2020.","James Picariello","Got it. And just last one on buybacks. You have the $100 million target for the full year, $70 million deployed in the first quarter. Just wondering if there's still maybe some upside to that or maybe the prototype spending and the restructuring actions consumed cash that otherwise would have been deployed?","Thomas McGill","Right. So I kind of just have the same answer there. We have the $100 million guidance, but we do potentially look at opportunistically buying back more depending on other uses of cash like for potential acquisitions and other things. So some we continue to look at and we'll be opportunistic with.","Operator","We have time for one final question, and that question comes from David Kelley with Jefferies.","David Kelley","And just a couple of quick ones. I think, clearly, the China production weakness was well broadcast, but we've been hearing from others that the market appears to be at least stabilizing. Just can you speak to if there's any change from your vantage point in either customer sentiment around potential volume improvement on the horizon or if there's any change in maybe the potential outgrowth you're seeing for the pipeline in your market?","Frederic Lissalde","So the market is stabilizing from the current run rate. Now what we see is the next generation of new programs -- next generation of our new programs in China. And we see schedules for those new programs starting -- accelerating, starting in Q2. But from a market standpoint, we're not thinking that the market is going to recover.","David Kelley","Okay, great. And just a quick housekeeping, could you update us on your implied tariff headwind? I guess, is that still $20 million? I think if I recall, you weren't building in a step-up in those three costs there. So I just wanted to follow up.","Thomas McGill","Yes. So for that, it's still at that $20 million. There's very little impact for us with those three. But again, $20 million, $10 million in the quarter in Q1 and 2. And by Q3 and four, that will be in both years.","Patrick Nolan","With that, I'd like to thank you all for your good questions today. If you have any follow-ups, feel free to reach out to me afterwards. Thank you.","Frederic Lissalde","Thank you all.","Operator","That does conclude the BorgWarner 2019 First Quarter Results Conference Call. You may now disconnect."],"3310":["BorgWarner, Inc.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise.  After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question and answer period.  (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Ken Lamb, Director Investor Relations.","Ken Lamb","We issued our earnings release this morning at approximately 8 am Eastern Time.

Our actual results may differ significantly from matters discussed here today.  ","Now, moving on to our results Tim Manganello, Chairman and CEO will comment on the fourth quarter, the full year and current industry trends.  Then, Robin Adams our CFO, will discuss the details of our operating results and also our outlook for 2012.  With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tim.","Timothy M. Manganello ","Today I\u2019m very pleased to review our strong fourth quarter and full year results as well as our fourth quarter accomplishments.  First, I would like to thank all BorgWarner employees for a fantastic 2011.  Your strong performance reflects our dedication to BorgWarner\u2019s customers and our shareholders.","Now, on to the results let\u2019s start with the fourth quarter.  Sales were $1.8 billion up 16% from the same period last year.  US GAAP earnings were $1 per share but excluding a loss from disposal activities, earnings were $1.19 per share and Robin will explain the financial mumbo jumbo behind the disposal activities later. Our reported operating income margin was 10.8%, but again excluding non-recurring items, our operating income margin was 12% in the quarter.  ","Three key factors drove our results: increased global demand for our products; higher volumes in our base business; and well executed cost controls by our operating guise.  For the full year, sales were $7.1 billion up 26% from 2010.  US GAAP earnings and earnings excluding non-recurring items were $4.45 per share and in our full year operating income margin, it was 11.2% or 11.1% excluding non-recurring items.","Let\u2019s go to the engine group.  In the engine group fourth quarter sales were about $1.25 billion up 11% from a year ago.  The engine group continues to perform very, very well and results were led by accelerating turbocharger growth around the world, increased sales of engine timing systems including variable CAM timing, and greater sales of fan and fan drives which are linked to the commercial vehicle market.","In the drive train group sales were about $534 million up 27% from the fourth quarter 2010.  Drive train\u2019s results were driven by increased dual clutch transmission module sales in Europe, increased traditional automatic transmission component sales in Korea, and the Traction acquisition which was formerly known as the Haldex acquisition.","Now, the drive train group continues to make progress with its capacity and productivity issues in Europe.  In the quarter the groups\u2019 margin was 8.8% up from last year and up from the previous quarter.  Drive train\u2019s performance in the fourth quarter is a solid foundation for achieving the 9% margin or better that we expect from them in 2012.  ","Looking forward to the future, BorgWarner continues to invest for the long term.  Capital spending continues to grow.  For the full year we spent about 5.5% of sales.  We are committed to supporting our future growth and productivity improvements and our R&D spending was about 3.4% of sales in the quarter and for the full year.  We continue to trend towards our targeted level of 4% for R&D.  ","I\u2019m also proud to review some exciting announcements that we made during the quarter.  BorgWarner\u2019s regulated two stage, or R2S turbochargers have launched on the four cylinder Mercedes S Class BlueEfficiency engine.  This is the first four cylinder engine in the history of the S Class.  It delivers excellent performance while getting about 41 miles per gallon.  We are proud to set a new benchmark for a turbo charged downsized engine in the luxury segment with the Mercedes Benz.  ","Now, BorgWarner\u2019s double PIP platinum spark plugs are also featured with the next generation ignition coils for the Audi\u2019s 1.8 and 2 liter engines.  BorgWarner also supplies advanced technologies for five of Ward\u2019s 10 Best Engines and to all of the winners and finalize for the North American Car and Truck of the Year.  Finally, we announced $2.5 billion of net new business for 2012 through 2014 time period.  That\u2019s a 9% increase over last year\u2019s backlog.  ","So now let\u2019s take a look at our current outlook for 2012 for late vehicle production.  We first announced our 2012 outlook at Deutsche Bank\u2019s Automotive Conference in Detroit last month.  Our view is unchanged from that forecast.  We expect total global production volumes to be approximately 81.2 million units up 6% from 2011.  In North America we expect 13.9 million of production up 6% from last year, in Europe 19.3 million units down 4%, in China 18.6 million units up 8%, and in Japan 9.3 million units up 18%.  ","In Europe we expect midsized and large passenger cars to outperform the overall market just like it did in 2011.  This is due in part to exports through China and also exports to North America.  We also believe that these segments will be more resistant to production cuts due to their more affluent buyers.  As a matter of fact, I just went out and bought a Q7 Audi Diesel last night.  ","In the commercial truck market, we expect solid growth in North America and Brazil.  We expect the commercial vehicle market in Europe to remain relatively flat and in China, we expect a slight rebound.  However, BorgWarner\u2019s commercial truck business in China is growing for turbochargers, thermo systems, and emission systems due to our increased penetration rates.  ","Finally, our sales and earnings guidance for 2012 also remains unchanged.  Sales growth in 2012 is expected to be 10% to 12% or 14% to 16% if you exclude currency.  In Europe we expect our sales growth to outperform vehicle production by a wide margin in 2012 and our performance in the fourth quarter of 2011 supports this outlook.  ","In the quarter, European production was down 4% while our sales excluding currency and the Traction acquisition, was up 6%.  Our 2012 earnings guidance continues to be $5.35 to $5.65 per share and our operating margin is expected to be better than 11.5% for the year.  The 12% operating margin posted in the fourth quarter of 2011 provides great momentum towards achieving this target and 2012 should be another great year for BorgWarner.","In conclusion, the outlook for our business remains strong.  In 2012 we expect sales growth and profits in every major region of the world including Europe.  No company in the auto sector is better positioned for short term and long term profitable growth than BorgWarner.  The industry\u2019s adoption of our leading edge power train technology will continues for years and because of this, I feel very good about BorgWarner\u2019s future and so should our shareholders.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn it over to Robin.","Robin J. Adams ","To me this was a typical BorgWarner quarter just strong financially across the board.  Before I go through the out performance of the company from a financial perspective, I want to go through the macro industry environment for the fourth quarter.  If you look at fourth quarter global production it was about 19.7 million units, up about 1% from the fourth quarter of last year.  And again, if you look at our sales on a reported basis, they\u2019re up about 16% so very strong performance but that did include some foreign currency impact and also the Traction Systems acquisition which we made in the first quarter last year.","So if you eliminate those and really put the sales on a comparable year-over-year basis, fourth quarter sales increased was 12% and that\u2019s 11 percentage points better than 1% fourth quarter growth in global vehicle production.  Just another quarter-on-quarter-on-quarter-on-quarter, I don\u2019t know how many quarters this is but frankly, it\u2019s a lot where our sales growth significantly outperformed the market.  ","If you look at it on a full year basis, our sales were up 26% and again, if you eliminate the impact of currency and acquisitions we were up 16% with global production up 3% so we outperformed the market by 13 percentage points for the year.  And again, consistently quarter-on-quarter-on-quarter and as Tim talked about our guidance for 2012, 2012 is just going to be another year where we just beat the pants off the market from a growth perspective.","Let\u2019s look at the financials right now, particularly the fourth quarter income statement.  Gross profit as a percent of sales was 20.3% up from 20% a year ago and [inaudible] in the third quarter this year.  We had some commodity pressure in the quarter, not as much as we\u2019ve had in previous quarters, it was about $3 million and that puts us at about $35 million for the full year.","SG&A expenses were 8.3% of sales in the quarter versus 9.7% in the fourth quarter of last year despite a year-over-year increase in R&D spending.  R&D as a percent of sales was up slightly to 3.4% from 3.3% a year ago.  If you look at total SG&A spending year-over-year it was relatively flat however, R&D spending was up about $9 million in the quarter or 17% higher spending in the fourth quarter last year.","In talking about SG&A, during last quarter\u2019s earnings call we discussed a $10 million benefit that we got in SG&A in the third quarter related to equity incentive compensation expense.  Again, this was a function of our stock price declining from about $80 a share at the end of the second quarter to about $60 at the end of the third quarter.  We also at that time said our full year guidance assumes we got back to that $80 share price and would penalize the fourth quarter.  However, our year end stock price was about $64 a share which resulted in only a $2 million negative impact in fourth quarter SG&A and operating income or about $0.01 per share negative impact.  So not a big event for the quarter.  ","Looking at reported operating income in the quarter it was $191 million or 10.8% of sales as Tim said.  However, we did have asset disposal activities in the quarter which resulted in a pre-tax book loss of close to $22 million.  We already announced the sale of our tire pressure monitoring business in December and the loss related to that, and the majority of the loss on this line item is related to that transaction including a few other minor disposal activity clean ups.","The disposal activity loss shows on the other income expense line item of the income statement if you\u2019re looking for it.  It\u2019s pretty easy to see, it sticks out and it\u2019s right above the operating income line.  Excluding these special items, this loss on disposal activity, operating income was $213 million or 12% of sales and that is an all time record for BorgWarner and that\u2019s compared with $157 million or 10.3% of sales a year ago.","If you look at the improvement in operating income margin which is pretty meaningful, it really reflects the outstanding performance we have in this business controlling costs while we continue to grow our top line sales.  As you look further down the income statement equity and affiliate earnings was about $10.2 million up slightly from $9.8 a year ago and if you remember the equity and affiliate earnings primarily reflects the performance of our drive train systems 50\/50 joint venture in Japan which is NSK Warner.  That joint venture services our Japanese customers for transmission products in the Asian market.  It also reflects our India turbocharger joint venture as well to a lesser degree.","Looking further down, interest expense and finance charges were $17 million in the quarter, down from $22 million a year ago primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign interest rate swaps on our debt and lower average interest rate on some of our short term debt.  Taxes in the quarter $58 million which if you do the math is an effective tax rate of about 31% and that\u2019s quite a bit higher than what we\u2019ve been given for expectations for the year of about 24%.  ","Now, included in there is the tax impact of the disposal activities and that was about $2.7 million of tax expense.  So if you exclude the disposal activity tax implication our tax rate from operations in the quarter was about 27%.  Now, this is still a little higher than the 24% full year forecast but when you look at it on a full year run rate basis, the full year run rate is about 24.8% versus our 24% forecast.  ","Unfortunately, that 8\/10ths percent difference in the full year rate that all gets slammed into the fourth quarter and that\u2019s why you get that 27% effective rate for the fourth quarter.  So you\u2019ve got 24% for nine months, 27% in the fourth quarter and it gets you to 24.8% for the full year, so we weren\u2019t that far off.  For the full year as Tim said, our reported US GAAP tax rate was 25.5% and again, that\u2019s 24.8% excluding all the unique items.  ","Net earnings attributable to non-controlling interest which again, was formerly known as minority interest, was $5.2 million in the quarter up from $3.9 million a year ago.  Again, this line item reflects our minority partners\u2019 share in the earnings performance of our Korean and Chinese consolidated joint ventures.  The fact that this charge is up just reflects the continued growth in this business, very strong growth of our business in Asia.","That brings us back to the bottom line of net earnings which were $122 million in the quarter on a US GAAP basis or $1 a share.  Again, as we\u2019ve already discussed, fourth quarter earnings included a loss from disposal activities of approximately $0.19 per share.  We\u2019ve identified that in a table in our press release as we typically do.  This is to help you reconcile our reported US GAAP earnings measures with the financial performance of the continuing operations of our company and to help you in comparing our fourth quarter results with prior periods and future periods.   We view this as an important part of our press release and we encourage you to review this information as well as our 10K which should be filed by the end of the day today.  ","On a comparable basis though, fourth quarter 2011 net earnings were about $146 million, $1.19 a share up 34% from $0.89 a year ago.  Very strong performance for the company.  Again, briefly touching on the full year, sales were a little over $7.1 billion up 26% from 2010 and again, adjusting that for acquisitions and currency puts us at about 16% versus a 3% market growth.","US GAAP earnings were $4.45 a share, up 47% from 2010.  Now, there were a few non-recurring items throughout the year but when you netted them out it really had no affect on earnings.  So it was $4.45 a share on a GAAP basis, $4.45 on what we would say a continuing basis.  ","If you look at operating income our margin was 11.2% reported, 11.1% excluding the non-recurring items.  Solidly above our original guidance for the year which was 10.5% floor for 2011 so keep that in mind when we talk about our guidance for 2012 of 11.5% floor, right Tim?  When we started 2011 we said that we expected incremental margins of about $0.20 year-over-year and excluding non-recurring items and currency, our incremental margin was about $0.19 on the dollar.","If you exclude the acquisitions in addition, our incremental margin was just over 23% and this was a record year for BorgWarner any way you look at it sales growth, margin performance, earnings, etc., etc., etc., cash flow, just a phenomenal phenomenal year for BorgWarner as Tim said. We\u2019re really proud of the performance our operations put forth.","Speaking of our operations, let\u2019s look at the segment data.  Engine segment sales as Tim said, were a little over $1.2 billion, $1.245 billion in the quarter, up 11% versus fourth quarter last year.  On a comparable basis or excluding currency, engine segment sales were up 12% compared with the third quarter 2010.  If you look at the strong global growth across the engine segment portfolio, sales were driven by turbochargers, new timing systems, fans, and fan drives.","EBIT for the growth, adjusted EBIT, was $203 million in the quarter or 16.3% of sales significantly higher than the 14.5% adjusted EBIT margin reported a year ago.  When you look at the year-over-year incremental margin excluding currency in the quarter, the engine guys hit the ball out of the park with a 31% incremental margin.  ","If you look at the drive train segment, sales were $534 million in the quarter, up 27% versus last year.  On a comparable basis, or again if you exclude the currency impact and the Haldex Traction Systems acquisition, drive train sales were up 12% compared to the fourth quarter of last year.  So with engine segment sales up 12% and drive train up 14% you can see both segments outperform the 1% global automotive industry products in the quarter very handedly.","Strong traditional transmission component sales in Asia and higher dual clutch transmission module sales in Europe were the key growth drivers for drive train in the quarter and have been throughout the year.  On a reported basis, adjusted EBIT was $47 million or 8.8% of sales which was up from 7.6% reported in the fourth quarter 2010.  As Tim mentioned, it continued the sequential improvement we\u2019ve seen in drive train from the lull of 6.6% in the first quarter of 2011 , 7.4% in the second quarter, 8.1% in the third quarter and as we said in the third quarter we expected drive train to get close to that 9% margin level and in fact they did that with their 8.8%.","Even as we\u2019ve said before throughout 2011, the purchase accounting expense amortization from the Haldex Traction Systems acquisition is negatively impacting drive train margins.  If you take out the Haldex Traction Systems acquisition and look at the drive train segment margins on a comparable basis last year, they actually were about 9.6% a full two percentage points better than the fourth quarter of last year on an apples-to-apples basis and the best quarterly performance we\u2019ve seen out of that business since prior to the 2008\/2009 recession.","So again, if you look at the drive train system business they\u2019re back, they\u2019ve fixed their issues, they\u2019re stronger than ever and that\u2019s why, as we\u2019ve said before, we expect them to generate all in, even with the Haldex Traction Systems, expect them to generate margins of about 9% plus for 2012.  ","On a year-over-year incremental basis again, excluding the currency and the Haldex transaction, incremental margins were $0.24 on the dollar.  Very strong performance from the drive train group and as I said, we continue to see improvements in the business and fourth quarter again, is a solid foundation for the drive train segment achieve our targeted margin of 9% or better in 2012.","Now, let\u2019s look at the balance sheet for a second and cash flow.  We generated over $700 million from operating activities in 2011.  That\u2019s up almost $170 million from 2010, very strong performance.  Capital spending was just shy of $400 million, up about $120 million from 2010 levels.  The year-over-year increase in capital spending is indicative of the growth required to meet the increased level of program launches that we have around the world, particularly in markets like Asia, South America, Eastern Europe, and Mexico.  ","Free cash flow which we define as cash from operating activities or that little over $700 million, less capital spending, a little bit less than $400 million, was $314 million in 2011 up $52 million from $262 million in 2010 or almost 20% higher.  If you look at the balance sheet itself, debt increased by approximately $150 million in 2011.  Cash decreased by about $90 million.  That\u2019s about $240 million net swing and that was primarily due to the acquisition of the Haldex Traction System business which was in the first quarter last year, about a year ago, and the buyout of our emissions joint venture partner in India in the third quarter for about $30 million.  That item shows up in our cash flow statement as purchase of non-controlling interests.","We generated enough cash internally to fund the growth of our capital spending, the growth of our business and also to fund the stock repurchase program that we had in 2011.  If you look at the capital structure net debt to capital was about 28% at the end of 2011 compared to 24% at the end of 2010.  Net debt to EBITDA on a trailing 12 months basis was just below one times at the end of the year.  ","However, as we\u2019ve said before, we really review our balance sheet and capital structure on an if converted basis and we encourage all of you do to the same.  The convertible debt, which we are converting from a capital structure perspective as we look at this balance sheet matures in about two months from now and frankly, I\u2019ll be happy to be able to stop talking about this if converted, we\u2019ll look at our capital structure because it will be converted.  Anyways, on an if converted basis, net debt to capital is about 18% at the end of the year.  Net debt to EBTIDA was approximately 0.5 times so very strong capital structure and ready for the next strategic acquisition to come along and be part of the BorgWarner fold.","As Tim said, 2011 was simply another great year for BorgWarner and really sets the stage for another strong financial year in 2012.  As Tim said, our sales growth and earnings guidance remains unchanged from what we provided last month at the Detroit Auto Show Conference.  Frankly, it was about 30 days ago so not much changes in 30 days.  We continue to expect sales growth of 10% to 12% compared with 2011.  But again, if you adjusted for currency about 14% to 16% again, which will be about 10 percentage points above the 5% to 6% global market growth we\u2019re looking at right now for 2011.","Earnings will be in a range of $5.35 to $5.65 per diluted share which is approximately 25% higher than 2011\u2019s all time record earnings for the company.  From a margin perspective, we do expect to achieve better than a 11.5% margins with R&D spending up another 20% over 2011 levels and that\u2019s on top of the 35% growth in R&D we had in 2011.  So we\u2019re really putting the money into R&D in this company to help fund the future growth of this business.  Looking at 11.5% or better operating income margins, we just did 12% in the fourth quarter, so we feel pretty good about the better than 11%.  ","Incremental margins as we look at it year-over-year again, should be north of 20% although the impact of currency will have some reported impact.  We are expecting the Euro to be $1.30, it was approximately $1.40 in 2011 so we\u2019ll see about a 4% to 5% decline in sales related to currency as we pointed out in our guidance.  That will have an impact on the incremental margins because the incremental margin on that currency is about the 11% to 12% range.  If you strip that out, incremental margins again, will be north of 20%.","We expect to generate in 2012 approximately $1 billion in cash from operating activities and capital spending will be north of $450 million in 2012.  We talk about higher raw material costs, approximately $35 million in 2011, we\u2019re looking at about $25 to $30 in 2012.  As always, that will change throughout the year.  Again, as we\u2019ve said before, whatever the raw material price increases are we\u2019ll absorb that and manage that throughout the year.  It will not have any negative impact on our earnings expectations.","To summarize here, we achieved record fourth quarter earnings.  We outperformed the industry relative to sales by 11 percentage points.  The drive train segment continued to improve margins and actually on a comparable historical basis are at an all time margin high and the engine segment margins again, also remained near record levels. ","It was a strong finish to a very strong year and provides great momentum for us as we move into 2012.  To me again, this was just another typical BorgWarner quarter on top of quarter-after-quarter of very strong performance.  We expect 2012 to be another year of solid growth, record margins, and record profits.  As we observe the trends in the market today, we see even more growth and more record profits beyond 2012.  ","Our confidence in this stems from a regulatory environment that continues to become more stringent, fuel costs that continue to churn higher, and as a result OEMs and end customers favoring advanced power train technology that only BorgWarner can bring to the market.  Our product portfolio is focused on improving fuel economy and lowering emissions which is precisely what the market is focused on today.","We expect this strong demand for our products to continue for many years to come.  Our technology leadership, strong global presence, financial discipline, and focus on attracting and maintaining a talented work force around the global have been the keys to the company\u2019s success and the keys that will continue driving our success in the future.  ","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Ken for questions and answers.","Ken Lamb ","We will now turn to the Q&A portion of the call.  I would like the operator to please announce the Q&A procedure.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from Ravi Shanker \u2013 Morgan Stanley.","Ravi Shanker \u2013 Morgan Stanley","The 12% margin fourth quarter was really impressive but incentive comp helped you a little bit there.  Robin, can you help us understand what the trajectory of margins looks like in 2012?  Also, with your stock getting up to the high 70s will incentive comp be a headwind in 1Q?","Robin J. Adams ","12% was a record margin and remember incentive comp would have been a negative relative to performance so there really was no benefit for incentive comp in the fourth quarter.  We expected a penalty in the fourth quarter, we didn\u2019t get the penalty so the run rate in the quarter was pretty much a normal run rate.  We do given that the stock price again is higher running in the first quarter here, we\u2019ll get a little negative implication in the first quarter of 2012 related to equity incentive comp but I don\u2019t think anyone is going to be complaining about that, particularly our shareholders.  ","As we look at the 2012, the sequential for this business typically is from a margin perspective first quarter is a solid quarter from a margin perspective, the second improves a little bit, the third quarter is weak due to the seasonality and the fourth quarter is typically our strongest quarter from a margin perspective.  I would expect the same type of cadence in 2012 that we\u2019ve seen in 2011.","Ravi Shanker \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Did you say what material headwind is going to be next year in 2012?","Robin J. Adams ","We\u2019re looking somewhere about $25 to $30 million for 2012.  But frankly, whether it\u2019s $20 to $25, $25 to $30, $30 to $35 we\u2019ll manage through it.  I wouldn\u2019t have any expectation of any negative impact in our earnings guidance related to material.","Ravi Shanker \u2013 Morgan Stanley","When you speak on the balance sheet you threw in there that the balance sheet is in good shape for new strategic acquisitions.  Anything in particular you have in mind in terms of products or end markets?","Robin J. Adams ","Well as always we\u2019re looking for advanced power train technology.  We\u2019ve got a lot of things in mind, unfortunately we can\u2019t get the sellers to sell them just like a lot of the transactions so we\u2019re just going to have to continue to be patient.  Our VP of M&A is going to have to continue to go out nice dinners, and drink fine wine, and eat food trying to woe these potential sellers.  But that\u2019s our focus.  I tell them to spend a little bit more money on the wine this time around and maybe we\u2019ll get one of these guys to sell their company to us.  There\u2019s some attractive things out there, we\u2019ve just got to bring them in.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Analyst for Richard Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC.","Analyst for Richard Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC.","I just had a couple questions related to the drive train segment.  If we stripped out the purchase accounting, what kind of contributions are we looking from Haldex on the drive train segment?  And from a cadence standpoint do you guys feel like you can get to that 9% early on in 1H or is that more like a second half kind of phenomena.","Robin J. Adams ","If you look at the Haldex Traction Systems business, we purchased it in the first quarter so when you look at the fourth quarter versus the prior year there\u2019s nothing to compare it to so really their incremental margin is their all in margin.  If you exclude the purchase accounting they\u2019re running right about the average of the drive train business at about 9%.  So there\u2019s no incremental there now we\u2019ll see their incremental in the first quarter and I expect it to be comparable to typical BorgWarner incremental margins of about $0.20 on the dollar.  ","As we look at the drive train business again, fourth quarter was very strong for them and we don\u2019t expect them to fall down in the first quarter.  We\u2019ll see some continued strong performance.  As I said earlier, fourth quarter is typically our strongest quarter of the year so first quarter might not be as strong as the fourth quarter but it\u2019s going to be close enough.   And again, you\u2019ll see strength throughout the year but we don\u2019t expect to start the year off at 7.5% drive train margins in the first quarter.  It will be pretty comparable to fourth quarter levels, maybe a little bit weaker but not much and then it will build in the second quarter, we\u2019ll have that third quarter dip because of the shutdowns in the third quarter and then we\u2019ll see a strong fourth quarter out of them.","Analyst for Richard Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC.","The question that I have is what we saw on the engine side is your revenues pulled back a little bit in Q4 as normally we see a material increase sequentially from Q3.  I was just wondering if you could sort of explain that?  Was that something more to do with fx or can you put a little bit more color on that?","Timothy M. Manganello ","In the fourth quarter towards the tail end of the fourth quarter we saw a little bit of softness on some schedules in the southern European guys, the guys at PSA, Renault, Fiat and that impacted us a little bit on a couple of our business units including turbochargers.  That softness is starting to come back now in January, we\u2019re starting to see a rebound in the schedules in January so that contributed a little bit to the softness you saw towards the end of the fourth quarter.","Robin J. Adams ","We also had negative impact in currency, you\u2019re right.  If you looked at quarter-over-quarter, first of all third quarter was a pretty strong quarter for the engine group, a little bit stronger than normal because our customers ran a little bit more in the third quarter than they normally do.  But we were impacted by currency fourth quarter to the third quarter of about $45 million on the engine business.  So on a comparable basis fourth quarter to the third quarter, engine was actually up about three percentage points.  ","Again, our reference point is versus the prior year and the engine group was more than 11 percentage points sales growth relative to the industry.  So from that perspective we had a hell of a fourth quarter in the engine group and again, currency did impact the comparison fourth quarter to third quarter.  If you took our currency, we\u2019re actually up almost 3% in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter.  Again, third quarter was a pretty strong quarter for them.","Timothy M. Manganello ","When I talk a little bit about softness, I\u2019m talking about relative to our plan and the actual schedules we had gotten from the OEMs themselves coupled with our plans.","Analyst for Richard Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC.","Finally, on the 32% contribution margin in the engine segment, how sustainable is that?  How did the team generate that kind of return, I mean it\u2019s pretty impressive?","Robin J. Adams ","It\u2019s very impressive.  First of all I\u2019ll tell you they worked their butts off.  We had very strong performance out of all our business units.  In fact, as we\u2019ve said before we\u2019ve got a couple of business units in the engine side, we had disposal in the quarter and they\u2019re working real hard frankly on some of their overhead costs in the SG&A area.  So that helped a bit in the fourth quarter. ","We do not expect that $0.31 on the dollar incremental margin improvement in 2012.  As I said earlier, we\u2019re looking at about our traditionally $0.20 on the dollar out of both engine and drive train which is more typical.  They did have a very good fourth quarter.  There was a little improvement on some of our European guys in the fourth quarter.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","Just a couple things, first relative to your guidance, if you just from a very high level apply 15% organic growth and 20% incremental margins and then as you suggested take off that 5% fx and maybe an 11% margin, you still come up with EBIT of [174\/175] it\u2019s in the low 12s.  You\u2019re guiding to 11.5% plus it just seems like a decent delta there.  Is there something that I\u2019m missing in that bridge?","Robin J. Adams ","No, you\u2019re doing a macro rough look.  I wish the business were that easy Rod.  ","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","Just relative to your SG&A, your SG&A to sales is falling pretty steadily over the course of this year.  As a percentage of sales you had pretty steady revenue, how should we be thinking about that number going forward, the SG&A?","Robin J. Adams ","As I said earlier, we\u2019re looking for a sizeable increase in R&D spending again 2012 versus 2011 which will get us higher spending on the SG&A line.  We\u2019re looking at about a 20% increase.  But, if you look overall to the business we\u2019re still expecting SG&A closer to 9% than its historical 10% level.  ","Timothy M. Manganello ","The other thing you\u2019re seeing is we\u2019re starting to leverage our existing platforms in Europe and North America.  Take Europe for example, a lot of the growth we are going to see in China will be based on not just domestic OEMs in China but also European OEMs in China that are taking technology and launching vehicles in China that are using existing designs and existing products that we\u2019ve already designed and manufactured and spent all the extra SG&A on in Europe.  The guys in China, or Asia in general, are leveraging off the SG&A that\u2019s already been spent in Europe with carryover products.  ","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","Two maybe things you can maybe hit for us, your engine margins as you pointed out, our up very strongly low 16s here.  Is there anything you see on the horizon that would cap that out?  Then lastly, you may have mentioned this already, but IHS did adjust their production forecast subsequent to your guidance.  Did you look at that and basically conclude that the platforms they had adjusted were not that relevant to you or were you not using IHS when you provided the guidance initially?","Timothy M. Manganello ","We use a number of information including IHS but at the end we make our own determination and based on what we\u2019re seeing and based on our analysis, basically we\u2019re not changing our estimates for production in any parts of the world at this point in time.  We think we\u2019ve been pretty accurate in years past and we think we\u2019re pretty accurate this year.  We\u2019re not changing anything but we continue to monitor it and as the year goes on we\u2019ll typically make one or two adjustments in the middle of the year or the third quarter of the year as we see the year developed but there\u2019s no need for us to change what we see right now.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","And the engine margins?","Robin J. Adams ","Do they cap out?  Relative to 2011 we still see a little bit of upside on operating income margins in the engine group.  As we\u2019ve said before, our margins will cap out when our sales growth slows.  ","Timothy M. Manganello ","Our margins are somewhat dependent on our technology.  The better we can [inaudible] technology and separate ourselves from our competition the better we can maintain or improve our margins.  As far as I\u2019m concerned margins are tied to two things, how well we develop new technology that our customers really want and how disciplined we are in running our business.  I think we\u2019re pretty damn good in both.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Himanshu Patel \u2013 JP Morgan.  ","Himanshu Patel \u2013 JP Morgan","Tim, I wonder if you could update us a little bit on the competitive dynamics in the turbocharger space?  I think maybe a little less than a year ago you guys had talked about Bosch and Conti having secured only about a 5% share of the sort of contracts that you saw being out there by mid decade.  Two questions, one is that still the kind of ballpark of market share that you\u2019re seeing for those guys?  And then number two, I\u2019m just wondering they may have secured a certain amount of share but they clearly would be bidding on a much larger scope of the market?  I\u2019m just trying to understand how much of the turbocharger bidding activity is such where you are seeing four players instead of the kind of two or three traditional guys?","Timothy M. Manganello ","Even before Bosch and Conti got into the picture we saw four players because we had two Japanese competitors along with ourselves and Honeywell.  Conti has got a little bit of business at Ford.  I think they\u2019re getting ready to launch it right now.  I don\u2019t know if they won anything more since then.  Bosch [AMLA] joint venture has got a little bit of business at Volkswagen.  I don\u2019t know where they are in their launch cycle.  ","Actually, we see everybody bidding on all the projects.  We bid based on our technology and what price levels we\u2019re willing to live with and we\u2019re winning a significant amount of turbocharger business and we\u2019re doing it without sacrificing pricing or margins.  I think, like I\u2019ve said many times, we are focused on the higher tech part of the turbocharger business, the technology that delivers the best fuel economy at the same time giving the best durability.  ","Competing against Honeywell all these years is tough enough and it\u2019s really not that different just adding a couple more competitors.  They\u2019re typically focused on the lower end technology portion.  We have won a significant amount of new business in the last 12 months which will eventually roll into our backlog when we announce that in November.  I don\u2019t go by batting averages or anything else, I just track how much new business we win by dollars and we won a significant amount of dollars in 2011 as compared to 2010 or 2009.","Himanshu Patel \u2013 JP Morgan","Are you sensing that sort of 5% number is changing though?","Timothy M. Manganello ","Not really.  I think they\u2019ve won some business and now they\u2019re in the launch stage.  They\u2019re bidding on other new business but are they getting much more than they\u2019ve won in the past?  Not that I can tell.","Himanshu Patel \u2013 JP Morgan","A somewhat related question just given their proliferation of turbochargers in so many power trains, it seems like it\u2019s so integral to the engine, any risk here that the OEMs consider in sourcing this product area?","Timothy M. Manganello ","I learned a long time ago both in this industry and outside this industry never say never.  I don\u2019t see any activity in that score right now.  We see a little bit in Europe where people would like to be in the turbocharger business.  Mercedes or Daimler has got a piece of the action with one of the Japanese turbocharger companies, they\u2019ve got a small joint venture.  It could happen but I don\u2019t see any activity going on right now what\u2019s over and above what\u2019s normal.","Himanshu Patel \u2013 JP Morgan","The next question, I think for the fourth quarter you guys mentioned your kind of clean organic European revenue growth was 6% versus industry of -4%.  That sort of 10 percentage points of outperformance can you just directionally talk to what you expect that to be for full year 2012 just given what you\u2019re seeing on platform mix and your own backlog?  Should we think about sort of a similar magnitude of European outperformance for Borg?","Robin J. Adams ","Actually, we\u2019ll probably be a little bit stronger.  I think, as we\u2019ve said before, we\u2019re looking at a market in Europe that\u2019s going to be down about 4% to 5%.  We\u2019re looking at our sales in Europe on a reported basis up about 10% and there\u2019s a little bit of negative currency impact there as well.  We\u2019re going to be pretty strong relative to the market in Europe in 2012.  ","Timothy M. Manganello ","As a matter of fact in 2011 we increased our European presence percentage wise a little bit already in 2011 for the full year and that didn\u2019t include the Haldex acquisition.","Operator","","Your next question comes from John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a question on the drive train business, you guys have highlighted DCTs in Europe as a point of strength and your standard transmission parts in Asia as a point of strength, I was just curious where you stand right now with your old school drive train?  Not disparagingly but your standard drive train transfer case business with trucks in North America, particularly with Ford, what level of capacity utilization you\u2019re at there?   As that market improves could that be a real source of upside for drive train?","Timothy M. Manganello ","We\u2019ll we\u2019ve got all Ford\u2019s standard duty transfer cases, we\u2019ve got all of the Ram trucks standard duty and heavy duty trucks.  As you see Ford and Dodge doing better month-on-month and doing very well in the truck markets, that\u2019s a direct correlation to us in a positive way.  Would I like to have some GM business?  Yes, but I\u2019m perfectly happy having the majority of Ford\u2019s business, we have everything except the extreme heavy duty portion.  ","As the truck market is doing well we\u2019re doing well.  Capacity, we are tight on the capacity on the Dodge transfer cases.  We are at capacity or just slightly below capacity on the Ford.  We can do more Ford.  We\u2019re actually putting in capacity right now for Dodge.  I would hope that they challenge us with more volume in the future because we can put capacity in fairly quickly on that product line.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a second question on the BERU double platinum spark plugs on the Audi  engine, as we look at that is that purely incremental content or are you replacing some former BERU spark plugs there?  I\u2019m just trying to understand is that all incremental growth?","Robin J. Adams ","That\u2019s all incremental.","Timothy M. Manganello ","That\u2019s incremental new technology.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That\u2019s on two programs right now but you\u2019re talking about two more?  Are those global platforms or engine platforms?","Timothy M. Manganello ","In my comments we said we\u2019re going to launch it on the Audio 1.8 2 liter.  Those are global engines for Audi so I\u2019m pretty sure when they go global we go global. ","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Lastly, just on the potential for a dividend obviously, there\u2019s a lot of capital going to growth.  You guys were previously a great dividend payer, I\u2019m just curious what your thoughts are on the potential for a dividend reinstatement?","Robin J. Adams ","That\u2019s a great question.  We continually discuss that issue.  I think there\u2019s a couple of things here, first of all as you point out, our focus is growth and we really like to reinvest our cash in the business. The way we make acquisitions, you never know when they\u2019re going to come so we do have to have a very strong capital structure and be able to have the cash on hand to be able to make a transaction when something becomes available.  So we\u2019re holding a little bit more cash because of that.","Second, we found out in the last recession, 2008\/2009 that having a revolving credit facility available to use as cash for an acquisition maybe is not the way to go in these days because we saw a lot of banks just walk away from lending during that time period.  So we\u2019re less comfortable relying on a revolving credit facility, a little more comfortable relying on some cash.  So you\u2019ll see us carrying a little more cash on our balance sheet than we would have prior to 2008\/2009 when we were paying a dividend.","The second thing is the tax laws of the United States are really a disadvantage for an international company like BorgWarner and there\u2019s a lot of talk about changing the tax laws.  I think both from a corporate perspective and also from a personal income perspective the last thing we want to do is payout dividends and see them taxed at an ordinary income rate to our shareholders.  We think there\u2019s a more tax effective way to return capital to our shareholders.","So at this point in time the dividend is just going to sit a while until we get some clarity on US taxes.  It\u2019s going to sit a while while we continue to look for strategic acquisitions.  Again, our first focus is acquisitions.  We have had a history of purchasing shares in the market, we continue to do so.  If you look, we purchased some stock in the fourth quarter of 2011.  We\u2019ll continue to be in the market repurchasing stock.  ","Right now a dividend is kind of lower on our list of priorities for returning cash to shareholders but we\u2019re watching hopefully some tax law changes here in the next year or so that will provide some clarity on what is the best way to return capital to shareholders.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Joseph Sack \u2013 RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph Sack \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Going back to the drive train segment, if we strip out the Haldex acquisition, it looks like that\u2019s sort of been growing mid teenish.  Is that sort of you think a fair run rate for that segment going forward?  I know you called out DCT but what other products are really help driving that growth?","Robin J. Adams ","I\u2019ll talk about the run rate, Tim can talk about the products.  As we look at our backlog, our three year backlog, if you look at the total growth of the company we see the drive train business growing just about the same rate as the engine business.  As we look at growth as a company of 10 percentage points in excess of the market that\u2019s both engine and drive train growth.  So we expect continued good strong growth in the drive train business along with the engine business.  Tim, do you want to talk about the technologies?","Timothy M. Manganello ","Traditionally automatic transmissions they\u2019re going from four speeds to six speeds and six speeds to eight speed automatic transmissions. Every time you put another speed on a traditional automatic transmission it\u2019s another clutch opportunity for BorgWarner.  Also, because of the race between dual clutch and the competitive nature of people who are making dual clutch automatics versus the people who are making traditional automatics, the traditional automatic transmissions are trying to up their game in terms of fuel economy which is driving better shift quality. ","We make the [solenoids] for traditional automatics that people are upgrading to, to get better crisper and quicker shift quality with less parasitic losses.  Consequently we\u2019re growing very well on transmission [solenoids] with traditional automatic transmissions.  We\u2019re growing very well on clutches on traditional automatic transmissions.  ","Then you shift gears and go over to dual clutches.  There\u2019s two parts of the market on dual clutches there\u2019s the dual wet clutch and the duel dry clutch.  When you do the dual wet clutch which is a growing market globally, we supply the clutch module and the control module for the dual wet clutch.  That\u2019s pretty much two big pieces of content on the wet clutch.   On the dry clutch, even though we don\u2019t make the dry clutch module, we make the control modules for a number of the dry clutch transmission manufacturers so we\u2019re picking up having the competing business on the module itself.","The you go with four wheel drive business.  Four wheel drive business has continued to be a growth business now with trucks recovering in North America.  Actually, we were in China last week with our board and SUVs are becoming more fashionable in China so I see some opportunity for transfer case growth in China due to the SUV market becoming more fashionable again.","That coupled with the fact that we took a lot of cost out of the transfer case business that we have by basically closing down our [inaudible] operation and consolidating all our transfer case business in North America, in Seneca South Carolina.  Between a lot of products that are growing on the drive train side coupled with improving cost controls not just on the transfer case side but also on the transmission side should help us.  Consequently we should see growth in our sales and hopefully growth in our profits on the drive train side.","Joseph Sack \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","I appreciate the color on contribution margins and I think you said 20% for both segments, but for the drive train is that ex Haldex or sort of including the Haldex amortization costs?","Robin J. Adams ","That will be including Haldex. ","Joseph Sack \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","So implying it will be higher without the amortization?","Robin J. Adams ","The amortization cost is basically fixed so what you\u2019re really looking at when you look at incremental margins year-over-year you\u2019re looking at the core operations both for the traditional drive train business plus the acquired traction systems business.  So on an incremental basis year-over-year we expect to see operating performance and the purchase accounting numbers are flat year-over-year, should have no incremental impact.","Operator","","Your last question comes from Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs.","Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs","I had one remaining one because a lot of mine have been answered.  On the diesel penetration, following a few years of uptick in that in Europe, now that obviously we\u2019re heading into a much softer macro environment, how do you see that playing out?  I know that the export market is likely to remain okay which may help it but is that something that could impact you from a profitability standpoint if people down shift a little bit just given a more frugal environment?","Timothy M. Manganello ","We\u2019re seeing globally between 2011 and 2016 a 25% growth in diesel applications in the light vehicle market.  We\u2019re seeing some slight growth in Europe, but percentage wise it\u2019s about flat at 54% in Europe.  The percentage is flat in Europe but there\u2019s still growth in Europe.  What we\u2019re seeing growth in the rest of the world for diesel engines.  We\u2019re actually starting to see a little bit of uptick and interest in the United States for diesel also.","But, whatever happens on the diesel side, if they don\u2019t buy a turbocharged diesel there is a high probability they will buy a turbocharged gas engine with GDI.  So we\u2019re going to sell turbochargers either way it\u2019s just a matter of whether they\u2019re gas turbochargers or diesel turbochargers.  But the diesel market is still a growth market it\u2019s just not as fast as the growth market for gas turbochargers.","Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Just on that, is the content more or less the same between a diesel program and a gas program assuming kind of a similar vehicle similar power train output?","Timothy M. Manganello ","Let\u2019s just say it depends on application.  It varies from application to application but on the whole and on the average gas tends to be a little bit higher priced for a gas engine application turbocharger than a diesel application for a pass car.  When you get in the commercial side there is no gas engine it is just high priced diesel turbochargers and we like it that way.","Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Lastly, is a lot of the growth in diesel that you see outside of North America and Europe, is that mostly commercial applications or is there actually some hope of a take up in diesel in places like Latin America and Asia as well?","Timothy M. Manganello ","For pass car you mean?","Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Yes.","Timothy M. Manganello ","Oh yes, we\u2019re seeing increased penetration rates on diesel in other parts of the world.  India, we\u2019re seeing some in Asia and Korea, but it\u2019s not growing as fast in those parts of the world as turbocharged gas engines are.  Right now turbocharged gas engines \u2013 well, to give you an idea I said diesel engines for light vehicles globally are growing roughly 25% over the next five years, turbocharged gas engines are growing 150% roughly over the next five years.","Ken Lamb ","I\u2019d like to thank you all for joining us.

You'll find the link in the Investor Presentation section beneath the notice for this call. We encourage you to follow along with these slides during our discussion today.","With that, I'm pleased to hand it over to James.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Good morning, everybody. And, Pat, thanks for that intro. As Pat said, Ron and I are really pleased, actually, to share our results for 2017. And then, obviously, we're going to talk a lot about the outlook for 2018.","What I thought I would do is start by sharing a few thoughts on 2017 as we wrap that year up. And for those of you that are following along that, you can see some of that information on slide number 6 in the deck. And the headline really is 2017 was a great year for BorgWarner, $9.8 billion of sales, which is up 10.3% organically. And that's comparing to a light vehicle end market exposure for us of about 0.5% growth.","Looking at that by segment, the Engine sales were $6.1 billion, which is a growth of 7.7% organically. And Drivetrain finished up at $3.8 billion. That's up almost 15% organically, a very, very strong growth on the Drivetrain side. Regionally, how it broke down. We had strong growth in China and North America.","And our Europe light vehicle revenue was up mid single digit. And that's pretty impressive when you consider some of the diesel and gas mix shift that went on. That light vehicle growth was supplemented also by positive revenue trends in commercial vehicle both on and off road. Our EPS at $3.89 was up 19% year-over-year, which we're also very proud of. It's a very strong result for us.","Away from the specific numbers there, we had significant launches and wins across combustion hybrid and electric vehicles. We made a lot of progress across all three platforms. And we're expecting that to continue strongly in 2018 also.","We also, towards the end of last year, completed the acquisition of Sevcon which was a really important move for us strategically because that's increased our scale and capabilities in power electronics, which is a really important move for us. Also last year, we shared our 2020 revenue outlook of $11.5 billion to $11.8 billion with continued margin improvements. And as you can imagine, we're laser-focused on delivering that outlook.","I also thought it would be good on slide 7 just to kind of refresh everybody's view on the backlog. You remember last month in Detroit, we announced our net new business backlog of $2.0 billion to $2.4 billion for the period 2018 through 2020. And this new business is what supports our 2020 revenue outlook that I shared earlier.","I think the most important aspect of the backlog from my view is we see very good balance of growth across the product portfolio. So we're deriving growth from many, many products in the portfolio. And one of the ways that shows up, which is a really good move for us, is 50% of our backlog is related to vehicles with hybrid or electric propulsion systems. And then 50% of the backlog is related to vehicles with combustion propulsion.","So that drive for combustion, hybrid and electric balance is absolutely coming through. We also have very good regional balance and also a very good customer balance. So we have a nice diversity to the growth. So it's a really, really good story. And we were proud to share that last month in Detroit. And I thought it good to just refresh everybody on that.","As Pat said, I'll share some thoughts on the industry outlook turning to slide number 8. The headline really is we expect the overall global industry to be stable to slightly improved in 2018. Let me break that down a little bit for you. So from a light vehicle 2018 calendar year view, we're pretty closely aligned with the view of IHS.","So really, what that looks like is China growth is about \u2013 China is about 1% growth. Europe's up somewhere between 1% and 2% growth. And we see slight growth in North American production. So this implies global production growth of about 1% adjusted win for our geographical exposure. From a commercial vehicle viewpoint, we're assuming a flattish CV outlook in 2018. Orders in North America remained strong on the Class 8 side. But we do expect more modest growth in medium duty and offset by a little bit weaker demand in China.","I always like to give a sense of some of the key areas that we're paying good attention to, keeping our eye on as we go through the year. And I would say there's three really that we focus on. One is just the North American mature cycle. We're in an environment where it's pretty much flat to slightly improved production. But we'll always be watching that in terms of inventories and production in North America.","And diesel-gas mix in Europe continues to shift. So diesel share declined by approximately 740 basis points in Q4 and it was 480 basis points for the full year of 2017. We're going into the year expecting a 300 basis point to 400 basis point diesel to gas mix shift in 2018 and we'll be watching that. The good news from us as a company is, as we did last year, we're offsetting that diesel-gas mix with other favorable aspects in the business.","Last area we keep an eye on is China. We're expecting modest industry growth in 2018. But like all of you I think on the call, we continue to watch demand, particularly with the tax incentive changes that may occur through the year. All of that said, what we do is we expect to continue to outgrow the market strongly in 2018 based on the strong demand for our product mix.","Let me just give a couple of comments on technology trends. I think again, the main message I would share with you is the activity and focus on hybrid and electric continues to accelerate around the world. In hybrids, clearly, 48-volt mild hybrids continue to be in focus. That creates great content opportunity for BorgWarner, whether it's P2 clutch modules, whether it's eBoosting, whether it's iBAS-type systems. So that's a real push for us. I would say generally Europe is probably moving the fastest on hybrids. But we continue to gain more work and interest in both China and North America.","Electrics, I would say, again the Chinese OEMs continue to move at a very fast pace. And you see that flowing into our backlog with multiple awards on eGearDrives. We do see work with the Europeans increasing. And we're engaged with North American customers on electric vehicle products as well.","So I think the key point for us is that we expect 2018 and 2019 to bring significant industry awards for hybrids and EVs for BorgWarner. And we're very confident that we have the right portfolio to pursue this business. So we'll continue to focus on that and you'll see more announcements and bookings through the year on both hybrids and electrics.","Let me just highlight a couple of recent announcements that we made that you can see there on slide number 9. And I think these are another good indicator of what I was saying a few moments ago of the strength and the breadth of our product portfolio. So you can see there we have the on-axis P2 module development contract with a major Chinese OEM. That's a really good announcement for us. I think that's clear evidence that the Chinese OEMs are moving forward and accelerating their efforts on hybrids. And this is a great example, the P2 module, for us where we're leveraging both our clutching expertise and our motor expertise to present a unique module that very few people, if any, can do in the world.","The HVH250 electric motor and eGearDrive transmission for the initial launch of the FUSO eCanter truck. We talked about that a few weeks ago in Detroit. And this is the world's first series-produced all-electric light duty truck. And this is a great example of our EV capabilities where we're basically providing the complete propulsion system for an electric vehicle truck. A great win.","Last but certainly not least, the all-wheel drive coupling for Volvo's new XC40 compact SUV is a great win for us. And this is a good example of our integrated vehicle dynamics software and our ECU knowledge helping us bring a great system forward for Volvo. So it's a great example. It represents a very good balance to what we're winning across all aspects of combustion, hybrid and electric.","Let me shift gears, if I can, and talk a little bit about 2018 on slide 10. So first of all, for the full-year outlook, our organic growth and margin outlook is unchanged from the guidance we provided last month. So that's we expect organic growth of between 5% and 7% year-over-year in a market that's basically flat to up 1%.","Our consolidated operating income margin is expected to expand to 12.6% to 12.7%. And we've updated our EPS guidance to a range of $4.25 to $4.35 to incorporate our updated tax and FX guidance. And as you could imagine, Ron will share quite a bit of detail with you, that in his comments shortly after myself.","I also wanted just to say a few words about our Q1 organic guide, because when you look at that, it's a lower number than the full-year outlook. So our organic growth for Q1 remains at 3.0% to 5.5%. And there's a few aspects of timing that I just want to point out so you guys will have a good understanding of it.","First thing to think about in our Q1 number is industry production. So during Q1 of 2017, BorgWarner's weighted industry production grew approximately 4% versus less than 0.5% for the full year of 2017. So it's a tough industry comp for the year in Q1. Q1 2018 industry production is expected to be flat to in line for the 1% for 2018.","We also have a North American changeover. We have a significant changeover program that will go on in Q1. So that also creates a little bit of noise. And then also if you look at Q1, diesel is an impact for us as well because we didn't really see much of that diesel-gas mix shift in Q1 of 2017. And obviously, we're seeing that meaningfully in Q1 of 2018.","And then we have a little bit of noise around European launch timing. So that's what kind of helps maybe bridge you to have a better sense of our Q1 flows versus the rest of the year. That said, we're very, very confident and very, very comfortable in our full-year guide of the 5% to 7% and absolutely confident we'll execute on that number.","Before I turn it over to Ron, let me just give you a couple of comments about our emissions restructuring. We did incur additional restructuring cost in Q4. And we're going to expect some level of expense during the first half of 2018. Now, after a strategic assessment and review, we've determined that a sale of the non-core business is our preferred path for the products we've identified.","And in the fourth quarter, we launched a program to locate a buyer for these product lines. And as a result, we did record an asset impairment expense to adjust the net book value of this business to be fair value less cost to sell. In the event that we can't find a buyer, we will take the additional steps necessary to restructure the business to get it where we need it to be.","So let me quickly summarize before I hand it over to Ron. First of all, 2017 was a great year for the company. We exceeded our expectations for the top-line growth and operating performance was in line with our expectations. And we expect that \u2013 continue the success in 2018 with another year of above-industry average growth and significant new business awards. Finally, we're very committed to delivering the 2020 outlook we outlined last month.","So with that, let me turn the call over to Ron.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Before I review the financial details, I'd like to provide you with some of the highlights as I see them for the quarter.","First, the quarter was strong and it was a great finish to the year. Second, operating performance was on target. And finally, we are maintaining the organic growth and margin guidance. But we are increasing our EPS guidance based on the tax and FX benefits. Now as Pat mentioned, I will be referring to the supplemental financials slide deck that is posted on the IR website. I do encourage you to follow along.","Let's turn to slide 12. On a reported basis, sales were up 14.5%. But on a comparable basis, our organic sales were up 10.2%. This is very strong performance compared to our weighted average light vehicle industry production for the quarter which was up 0.3%. We saw 25% growth in China against a production market that was down 1%.","Europe revenue was up 9% compared to the 5.6% industry production growth in the quarter. North America revenue was 10% versus the 4% production decline in the quarter. And commercial vehicle was a benefit again, contributing more than 200 basis points. And then diesel-gas mix in Western Europe was a headwind but slightly lower than we expected going into the quarter.","Now, let's look at the year-over-year comparison for operating income, which can be found on slide 13. Q4 adjusted operating profit was $328 million or 12.7% of sales compared to $284 million in Q4 of 2016. Our operating margin of 12.7% was 10 basis points improvement year-over-year. On a comparable basis, operating income was up $37 million on $227 million of higher sales. That gives us an incremental margin of 16.4% in a quarter, which is in line with our expectations despite incurring higher bonus accruals in the quarter.","Our adjusted provision for income taxes was $85 million for an effective tax rate of 26% for the quarter. And the full-year tax rate came in at 28.2%. If you remember, our guide was 29%; so slightly better than the expectations for the full year.","I would also point out that the year-over-year increase in net earnings attributable to the non-controlling interest, the growth in this line item reflects our minority partner share in earnings performance of our Chinese and consolidated joint ventures. We do expect that to increase through 2018. Now, earnings per share on a reported basis was a loss of $0.70 per share. On an adjusted basis, net earnings were $1.07 per diluted share.","Now, let's take a closer look at our operating segments in the quarter beginning on slide 14 of the deck. Reported Engine segment net sales were $1.578 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the Engine segment on a comparable basis was 8.4% as demand for our light vehicle OEM products was supplemented again by growth in our commercial vehicle business.","Adjusted EBIT was $266 million for the Engine segment or 16.9% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Engine segment's adjusted EBIT was up $7 million on $117 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 7%. This incremental margin is the result of two factors.","First, this segment delivered extraordinary incremental margin performance of more than 100% in the fourth quarter 2016. So it was a difficult comparison. And second, we continued to experience year-over-year earnings headwinds in our emissions business. As James mentioned a few seconds ago, we are now exploring the sale of our thermostat and pipe product lines in the emissions business, which we believe are non-core.","Now, turning to slide 15. Drivetrain segment net sales were $1.023 billion on the quarter. Sales growth for the Drivetrain segment on a comparable basis was up 13.1% primarily due to higher all-wheel drive and transmission components and strong DCT growth in China. Adjusted EBIT was $124 million for the Drivetrain segment or 12.1% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Drivetrain segment's adjusted EBIT was up $31 million on $113 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 27%. This is very strong performance and reflects the successful ramp of new products.","Before I move on to our full-year guidance, I want to summarize the charge incurred during Q4 related to the U.S. Tax Act and summarize our outlook for taxes going forward, which is on slide 16. Our Q4 tax expense was $338 million, which includes many one-time items.","First, a total of $274 million is related to the 2017 Tax Act comprising of $105 million for the transitional tax, which is also known as the toll tax. Next, $64 million is the amount recorded for the reevaluation of deferred items. Also, an amount of $94 million was recorded to accrue for the anticipated withholding taxes paid to foreign jurisdictions when cash is remitted back out of those countries. And finally, there was $11 million of other tax expense related to the Tax Act for a total amount of $274 million.","We are incorporating an updated tax rate of approximately 28% going forward. The largest driver of modestly higher tax rate than many of you expected is the result of withholding taxes in other countries outside the United States. However, the good news is that over time, we fully expect that that rate will likely come down further after we incorporate some structural changes. We expect cash taxes to remain in the low- to mid-20% range.","Now, I'd like to discuss our 2018 guidance which we have increased from what we presented earlier in January. The increases are due to the foreign currency tailwinds and our updated effective tax rate related to the Tax Act.","Turning to sales growth guidance for the full year on slide 18, we continue to expect organic growth of 5% to 7%. The Sevcon acquisition is expected to add $45 million of revenue in 2018. Currency is expected to be $170 million tailwind now. Total revenue is now expected to be in the range of $10.52 billion to $10.69 billion.","Next I'll walk you through our operating income on slide 19. From a performance perspective, we expect mid- to high-teens incremental margins on net sales growth. Our consolidated operating income margin is expected to expand to 12.6% to 12.7%.","To finish up our full-year guidance, please turn to slide 20. EPS guidance range is now $4.25 to $4.35 per diluted share versus the $4.15 to $4.25 previously. The increase is driven by the impacts of the lower tax rate and larger FX benefit. Free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx, is now expected to be $525 million to $575 million which is up $25 million from our previous guide.","The tax rate is expected to be 28% like I mentioned earlier. Our assumptions for the dollar to euro exchange rate has been adjusted to $1.18 versus the $1.15. Just as a reminder, for every $0.01 change in the dollar to euro exchange rate equals about $30 million to $35 million of revenue. And I also want to remind you that this benefit comes through at roughly a 10% margin. So a higher FX benefit could be diluted to our full-year margin outlook.","Now, our first quarter guidance can be found on slide 22. First, sales. We continue to expect organic growth of 3% to 5.5%. This is below our full-year guidance due to the launch timing and difficult year-over-year industry comparisons like James mentioned earlier. FX is expected to be a $100 million revenue benefit in the quarter. EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.99 to $1.03 and this is including a $0.02 dilutive impact from Sevcon. This guidance is based on a 28% tax rate, incorporates a $1.18 euro assumption.","So my conclusion here is that the summary for Q4 and for the full year 2017 was another strong quarter and a great, great finish to the year. Organic sales growth of more than 10% despite flattish industry volumes and headwinds in the diesel-gas mix. Incremental margins improved sequentially and were just as expected throughout the year for us. And as we look forward to 2018 and beyond, we continue to drive intensity around our new product development and securing customer orders to participate in the impending electrification trend.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat.","Patrick Nolan - BorgWarner, Inc.","Sharon, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everybody. I just wanted to ask you, the lower incremental margin in Engine, how much of that was due specifically to the underperformance in the emissions business? And can you tell us what the losses are running at in that thermostat and pipe business that's for sale?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Sure, Rod. This is Ron. What I would tell you is that we incurred a year-over-year headwind of about $10 million in the quarter. If you do the math a little bit, I think our margins would have been probably comparable to the prior year. So we saw significant headwinds and they actually deteriorated throughout the year. If you remember, we were seeing $5 million, $5 million, I think, $10 million, $10 million as we went throughout the year by the quarters. So it was a significant headwind for us in the quarter.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","The loss run rate from the business that's for sale?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yes. The thermostats and pipes business was about a $10 million headwind for us in the quarter.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So that is the run rate, the quarterly run rate. And can you remind us just regionally what the commercial vehicle revenue breakdown is for you today? And also just lastly, what is the size of the light vehicle diesel business after the decline that we saw in 2017?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. Rod, this is James. So the commercial vehicle piece first. So it's about one-third. Regionally, it's about a third in the U.S. and about a third in Europe. And then the other third is split between China and South America. The other breakdown, it's about 50-50 split between on-road and off-road, if that's helpful for you. In terms of the diesel absolute number, I'm just trying to get that for you. Actually, Rod, if you don't mind, can I just unpack, kind of give that number to you offline in a separate call?","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","We can follow up with that. But back to the commercial vehicle, you said a third of it is China and South America. And that's the reason why you're expecting kind of a flat market.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah, that's right.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Is because declines there.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. That's right, Pat.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Hey, Rod, it's Ron. One more thing back on emissions. This is a higher level. So that's about a $200 million business product line for us that's incurring about a negative 10% margin. So you can do the math on that. So it's significant headwind for us throughout the year.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Right. But just on that, there are other issues that are obviously happening on the Engine business because you would have had flat margins despite the growth in the quarter.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","But take a look at last year's margins. We blew out the year in 2016, to say it politely, margins. And I remember in my script last year, I says don't model that going forward.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","It's just tough.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","It really, really didn't comp on the margins.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, got it, okay. Thank you.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thanks, Rod.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore ISI.","Chris McNally - Evercore ISI","Thank you so much, guys. Just a follow-up on the diesel assumption. So a 300 to 400 basis point decline, I think that's up from \u2013 you were talking about roughly 200 to 300. As you said, the market, just the rate of decline could be something like 500 basis points. Could you just help us understand some of the precautions you're doing? How you're thinking about what if we continue to see the declines that we're seeing in the UK and Germany roll out to some of the other markets? What are the implementation plan?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah, sure. So, Chris, this is James. So the first thing, just to be clear on. So our assumption on the diesel-gas mix is the same as what it was when we gave our update in Detroit. So we're projecting a 300 to 400 basis point shift through this year. Potentially, it could be worse than that. We just don't know. We had to put a line in the sand. For every 100 basis points it moves, think of it as that's about a $20 million net revenue impact negative to the company. So it's not that huge, frankly speaking, in a meaningful way.","What we're really seeing though is the majority of \u2013 the reason it's fairly small is a lot of these diesel vehicles that are not being sold and are being replaced with a gasoline vehicle, a lot of that has similar content for BorgWarner. So a turbocharged diesel vehicle in Germany or the UK, to use your example, would quickly be replaced with a petrol or gasoline turbocharged vehicle. So when you do all the math and net it out; for every 100 basis point move, it's about a $20 million impact for the company. So it's not that meaningful. I would also say, Chris, just as an anecdote if you look at last year, last year we saw a similar level of decline. And yet we still, as Ron said, delivered a 10% organic growth. It's because we found offsets in other parts of the business and we were still growing in Europe. So we're not dismissing it because it is there. But as you see, I think our ability to manage through those \u2013 that transition, we're very comfortable with that.","Chris McNally - Evercore ISI","That's fantastic. So it seems like you have a transition. This is a larger question and I know you guys have addressed this before on the call. But what are you hearing in terms of how the OEMs themselves will bridge the CO2 hole between, call it, late 2018 and 2021? Because we're seeing as they lose the diesel advantage, their CO2 rates for the fleet whether it's just a lower number of vehicles or a lower demand for PATV or even 48-volt. It seems like it's going to be a problem for them as they try to hit their targets for 2020. And I'm sure you're involved in some of those conversations to bring some of the better architectures forward.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. Well, you gave a great summary, Chris, actually. That was a really terrific summary of exactly the challenges the OEMs are facing. In the short run, the strategy really is shift from diesel to gas and optimize gasoline technology. So think advanced turbos, advanced variable cam timing. What it's doing more strategically and over the mid-term horizon is it's causing an acceleration of adoption of hybrid technology. That's the real push. So that momentum towards 48-volt mild hybrids, which I talked about in my commentary, is fast accelerating.","I would say the other thing that's happening in parallel is they're looking to get the most advanced gasoline technology that they can because there's still optimization you can do on the gasoline engine to get it more diesel-like type performance. So you're right. We're right in the middle of those conversations. And frankly speaking, it's utilizing a lot of our technology. But the pragmatic thing is it's an acceleration of hybrid and electric technology and rapidly cranking up the efficiencies on the gasoline engine. So more advanced turbos, more advanced variable cam timing and hybrid technology to go with that. So that's really what we're seeing, Chris.","Chris McNally - Evercore ISI","Great. Thank you, gentlemen.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks for taking the questions. And, James, just transitioning here as you did, talking about the hybrid and electric pipeline. If this characterization is wrong, please correct me. But it seems like geographically, what's in the backlog so far for hybrid and electric wins may be heavily China-weighted. So at what point, are we looking at 12 months from now or sooner or further down the line, does that start to sort of even out a little bit more geographically, get more of Europe in the balance, for example?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","James.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. Now what I would say as you look at the \u2013 at least through the three-year window with the backlog, the initial piece of the backlog is a little China-weighted. And that's predominantly because of a lot of the eGearDrive technology that we'd been launching in China. But as the backlog rolls out and flows out, you're seeing that regional balance become more balanced, frankly, as we launch hybrid technologies globally but heavily in Europe. And then as you kick on beyond the backlog, then it becomes even more geographically balanced. So I think you're right. In the short run, in the next year or so; it's a little China-oriented. And then that balance becomes much more balanced, frankly, as you go forward over the next two or three years.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","So just to make sure I'm understanding this right. What's already in backlog includes more geographic balance, say, two or three years from now out of the three-year net backlog?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. And then just after tax reform with repatriation opportunities, how much cash do you think you'll bring back? And what's your view to spending on M&A versus buybacks at this point?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","I'd say that \u2013 the way we look at this is that the Tax Act is going to make it very flexible to bring back cash. So as far as bringing it back like next week or next quarter, we don't have a significant need for the cash right now. But just having that flexibility is fantastic. A couple of years ago, we went through a lot of work to restructure to get cash to have a buyback program and a dividend program and to bring cash back. And this makes it a lot easier. I would say going forward, we are reevaluating our dividend policy. We are reevaluating stock purchases. Our stock repurchase program for this year is $100 million. But all of those decisions will have to be updated and reevaluated, what it means for the company. The thing I'm looking forward to is that we can deploy more capital back to the shareholders in, I would say, efficient way and a more flexible way going forward. But I think you're going to have to wait as far as us really giving our strategies to you folks going forward, okay?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah, no. Ron gave a good summary. The only thing that I would just say to you from my perspective \u2013 we do remain \u2013 continue to monitor M&A opportunity and particularly in the electronics, power electronics type space. We're very happy with Sevcon so far. That's going really well. But I think it's fair to say we would want to be on some level of M&A activity over the next couple of years to utilize that cash, particularly complementary deals such as Sevcon. It's the way to think of it.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Good morning, Joe.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Good morning, Joe.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","James, thanks for all the color on the puts and takes to the first quarter organic guidance. I was wondering if we could talk a little bit though about what you expect on the margins because it looks like the first quarter guidance assumes total company margins are about flat year-over-year. And if I recall correctly in the first quarter of last year, you had about a $5 million lease termination thing which is like 20 bps. That should reverse out, which implies the segments here would actually be down a little bit year-over-year. I just want to make sure I'm thinking about that right. And if that's true, what the drivers are there?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","That's correct, Joe, on the math. I would say that the first quarter is some transitional costs probably again that we're seeing operationally probably in the emissions business as well. We got to get that business right-sized. And we're a bit cautious about what that transition is going to cost us. The second item is that North America changeover of one of our major launches is going to impact us as well. It's a profitable product line for us. And that launch, as it starts to gear up in the second and third quarter, will give us some momentum. So it's two items. I'd say it's emissions headwind a little bit as well as this launch in North America.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And the launch is across both segments or more in Engine?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","It's going to be in the Engine \u2013 I'm sorry, it's in the Drivetrain group.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, Drivetrain.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","It's a four-wheel drive launch program.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then just to follow on, I guess, one of the prior questions, a bigger picture on tax reform here. You guys are always sort of been active out there in the market. You seem like you have a big pipeline. I think one of the things we've heard over the years is maybe some hesitance for companies to sell stuff because of tax implications or tax leakage or stuff. And I'm wondering if any of that has sort of changed yet in sort of what you're seeing in discussions or pipeline or if it's still a little bit too early for that or just broadly, if you think this makes it easier to actually consummate deals.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Joe, that's a good question. I can tell you right now that in the M&A discussions that we're having that language hasn't come up about it being more favorable to release those assets and not have as much of a tax headwind. But I think that's going to play out over time. I'd have to think about that. But I have not had that discussion with our investment bankers that certain individuals would be looking to divest their assets now because it's more in a tax advantage position for them. But it's an interesting concept. I'd have to think about it longer, Joe.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thanks, Joe.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, great. Thanks for taking my questions. Ron, you mentioned on the tax plan that you're looking at a few things longer term to continue to maybe grind that down. I think some of us were expecting a little bit lower today. Where do you think your tax rate could get to over the medium term and how many years do you think it will take to establish kind of getting there?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah, David. Let me talk about what the items would be.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Sure.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","There's two main areas that we're looking at. One of them is when we bring cash back through different legal entities, if we can restructure those legal entities to lower that tax rate. I won't go into greater details, but that's one area. I'll just mention it's kind of out of Asia as we bring cash back and that will be significant to us. The other area is the way that intellectual property reimbursements go across borders right now. And we can change our strategy of where intellectual property is. Those two items would probably take over the course of one to two years to implement now. So that's the timing. As far as the rate, I hate to give you a number. But you can probably go down to the mid 20s fairly quickly in that number, 23%, 24% probably is a good number. But don't hold me to that number because this is a lot of work that we have to do to go through it. But the best part of all this I just mentioned is there is a pathway to lower that rate. So we're real confident we'll get there. We just got to have our tax folks do the work.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Understood. Look, that's incredibly helpful. And then James just on power electronics, how big of a business are you looking to buy versus eventually build? And thinking about M&A there, what technology or further capabilities are really needed that the OEMs are asking for in your conversations?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. No, it's a good question, David. So the way I would think about is what we have today with the acquisition of Sevcon, we're in a really good spot. And the reason for that is we've been investing pretty significantly over the last two or three years to build our organic internal electronics capability and knowhow. And we've done a nice job there. And then Sevcon added scale and obviously some actual products also. The key thing to think up for us as our power electronics strategy and the way to think of it is that we're not necessarily looking to be, quote, a big power electronics supplier of standalone power electronics, widgets or componentry. What we're all about is complementary power electronics knowhow and products to work in conjunction with our products. That's the real strategy that we're pursuing.","So we're not looking to add big scale and capacity just to go compete as a standalone power electronics guy. What we're looking is to add discrete technology that's complementary to our product offering. And the reason for that, David, simply put, is we're a propulsion system player. And in order to do that, you need obviously engine technology, you need drivetrain technology and you need power electronics knowhow and hardware that you can integrate and offer the OEM a complete solution. So all of that said, the way to think of it is if we can add another Sevcon or another couple of Sevcons over the next couple of years, that would be really good because it would just build more scale, more capability, more engineering, horsepower, frankly. That's really the strategy, if that helps you.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","No, it does. And are you finding that there's a plethora of those assets out there to look at or is it going to be harder to find as we think about other companies as well looking to beef up their technical capabilities through the shift towards EV architecture?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah, the way to think of it, David, there are quite a few companies out there that do that. The interesting thing is it's very rare you find a pure play. What I mean by that is you'll often have companies that have power electronics capability, but they're involved in multiple end markets. Now, they may be into industrials and other spaces. So what it's about is finding one that either has good automotive technology or the ability, such as Sevcon, that does have some automotive technology. But their industrial and commercial vehicle technology is very readily applicable to light vehicle technology. So not a lot of pure plays out there, David, but certainly players out there that could add capability and scale for us that we're continuing to monitor.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Understood. I appreciate the time. Thank you, gentlemen.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning. I want to talk a little bit about the backlog. As I kind of look at the distribution of your \u2013 the time series of your backlog over time, it picks up in 2020 and is a bit softer in 2018. Now, you've historically had that pattern going way back. But I know more recently you've tried to risk-adjust your backlog at least for the near term. So really kind of two questions. One, what are the puts and takes within your $650 million to $730 million guide around risk adjustment for either macro conditions, customer schedules, mix? And then, secondly, I know powertrain is very different from other sectors like seating where the awards are much more short cycle. But as you kind of look to 2020 based on the discussions you're having, would any of those help the 2020 backlog or are those really in the next backlog update?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. Let me see if I can help you, Brian. So the way to think of it is, I would characterize it that the, let's say the methodology shift, if you wish, that we made a year or two ago where we applied a little bit more of a rigid macro potential downside and launch cadence. It's the same methodology we're using for this backlog, if that helps you. So it's continuing on what we've done for the last couple of years. And the reason I say that is we've executed well over the last couple of years as you know. And so I feel it's well-apportioned with the backlog that we've got out now. It's not something that we've just really taken dramatic haircuts. It's not. I think it's set very appropriately is my view.","I think the one dynamic that's a little different about our backlog than some prior year backlogs that you may find interesting is our product breadth and product portfolio is much broader than it was historically and regionally balanced. We're better regional balance than we were historically where we're a little less dependent on Europe. And I think that helps us actually. I think that helps us have even more confidence in the ability to deliver the backlog. So that's how I would characterize it, Brian. I think if you look at it by products, you still have a good portion of turbo growth in there. We do see strong DCT growth in there. So all in all, we feel really good about this. And we're confident we're going to execute it frankly.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Second question which is somewhat housekeeping, somewhat restructuring. Your 28% GAAP tax rate, 20% cash tax rate, is it fair to assume you have some legal tax entities that are unable to use deferred tax assets and so hence you don't get the losses flowing through for that? Is that related to your emissions business? And how long do you expect the cash tax rate to run below GAAP?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","The first question you had there. No, it has nothing to do with the impact of losing any kind of credits through legal entities. We fully utilize all of our foreign tax credits in the process. So, no, that doesn't apply. And the second is our long-term plan is always to have our cash tax lower than our GAAP tax rate. The only time you have differences is, quite frankly, Brian, is when you have settlements with the closing of tax audits. Those are typically when you see unusual items on a cash basis and those are just one-offs. But normally on a run rate basis, you'll expect it to be lower. And the only difference is our tax settlements with tax years.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. So it's more structurally in terms of \u2013 can I assume that...","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Right.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","...the expenses and the CapEx you get to depreciate, bonus depreciation and so forth as opposed to anything like the OEMs not being able to write off losses under GAAP in money-losing geographies. Okay, thanks.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Correct.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","Your last question comes from Richard Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Hi, Rich.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Hey, Rich.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","On North America, so the last couple of quarters \u2013 last quarter you had a 20-point spread versus underlying production. This quarter is 14%. How should we think about this year? It seems like you have very good momentum there. I know there has been some key launches and obviously truck market shares are very high. But just how do we think about the cadence over the course of 2018 in terms of outperformance?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","You're thinking North America specifically, Rich, or -","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah, North America specifically. You've had really good outperformance there.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. We still expect good outperformance in 2018 versus the market. I don't have a specific number in my mind actually, Rich, but we can get you that. But we do see good. I think the one thing what we do see is in the quarter, we have the changeover program that we're dealing with on the truck side that Ron alluded to earlier. So Q1, it'll be distorted a little bit by that truck changeover. But I think we'll have good outperformance. It probably won't be quite as high as we did last year, but it's still pretty good. But I'll have Pat and Ron try and get you a bit more specificity, Rich, so we can get a number to you. But think of it as good outgrowth in North America but probably not quite at the high level of last year.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, I appreciate that. And then two for Ron here. Just to clarify, the emissions losses on the non-core stuff; that's part of guidance, correct? That's within the Engine \u2013 well, that's how we should model it correctly?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yes. So the 2018 guidance includes the operating performance of the pipe and thermostat business. And what I was trying to allude to was that in the quarter one, we just have to execute basically what's in our plan at this point. So our puts and takes could be we could execute better, we could execute worse than what's in the plan. The restructuring costs will be all called out, okay. It won't be in the run rate in the margins.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Sure. But that $10 million is the run rate, correct, $10 million loss?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yes, correct.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And you don't expect that to be any worse or any better. That's kind of the run rate we should think about.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","That's the run rate that you should expect, correct.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Now, obviously, we're going to try to improve it, right, and not make it worse.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Right.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","But that's what's in the guidance right now.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Right, okay. And just real quick on free cash flow. So CapEx is going up. That explains some of the miss or I should say the decline in free cash flow. Like you had a very good year in 2017. Is there something going on in working cap? Looks like there's maybe $30 million or so gap there relative to the free cash flow guidance and then the CapEx increase. Just anything noteworthy there?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","No, I don't think there's anything noteworthy on that right now. It would be working capital. A couple of things you have to note is we have to build banks in the emissions business to move the products back into other plants that we want to move. So that's one issue is the bank builds throughout 2018. But the other side, the more positive side is there are some opportunities to improve it that we're working on. So that's where we're at right now. We're working on some opportunities, but we do see some headwinds of bank builds.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. This makes sense.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2013 Third Quarter Results Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Ken Lamb, Director, Investor Relations. Mr. Lamb, you may begin your conference.","Ken Lamb","Thank you, Cherry. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. We issued our earnings release this morning at approximately 8 a.m. Eastern Time. It's posted on our website, borgwarner.com, on our homepage. A replay of today's conference call will be available through November 6. The dial-in number for that replay is (800) 585-8367. And you'll need the conference ID, which is 74423572. The replay will also be available on the website.","With regard to our IR calendar, we'll be attending a number of conferences over the next few months. November 4, we'll be at the Gabelli Automotive Symposium in Las Vegas; November 13, we'll be at the Barclays Global Automotive Conference in New York; December 5, we'll be at the Goldman Sachs Auto Conference in London; and January 15, we'll be at the Deutsche Bank Global Auto Industry Conference in Detroit; and finally, on November 5, we'll be at the Baird Industrial Conference in Chicago. Also on that date, Tuesday, November 5, at around noon Eastern, we will release our 2014 through 2016 book of net new business. At 4 p.m. Eastern that day, we'll host a brief conference call to answer questions about the backlog.","Now back to the call. Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties, as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today.","Now moving on to our results. James Verrier, President and CEO, will comment on third quarter results and current industry trends; and then Ron Hundzinski, our CFO, will discuss the details of our operating results and also our outlook for the remainder of 2013.","With that, I'll turn it over to James.","James R. Verrier","Thank you, Ken, and good day, everybody. So today, I'm very pleased to review our third quarter results as well as our third quarter accomplishments. Let me first off begin by congratulating all of the BorgWarner employees on an excellent third quarter. Your efforts drove outstanding results in a challenging environment.","Now on to our results. Reported sales were $1.8 billion, which is up 6% from a year ago, including the impact of foreign currencies and dispositions made in the last 12 months. Our U.S. GAAP earnings were $1.45 per share.","Operational efficiency and cost controls enabled us to post a strong operating margin of 12.5%, which is a new third quarter record, truly outstanding performance by our operations.","So if I look into the segments, in the Engine Group, the third quarter sales were $1.2 billion, which is up 4% from a year ago, after excluding the impact of foreign currencies and dispositions made during the last 12 months. These results were led by higher sales of turbochargers, variable cam timing devices and exhaust gas recirculation, or EGR, coolers around the world.","On to the Drivetrain Group. Sales were $600 million. This is up 10% from the third quarter of 2012 when we exclude foreign currencies. Drivetrain's results were driven by higher sales of all-wheel drive systems and transmission components in both North America and Korea.","And as we look to the future, BorgWarner continues to invest for the long term. Capital spending continues to grow, and in the quarter we spent about 5.7% of sales as we remain committed to supporting our future growth and productivity improvements.","Our spending for R&D was about 4% of sales in the quarter, which is right in line with our target.","I'd also like to talk about some of the exciting announcements we made during the quarter. First of all, BorgWarner is building a new manufacturing facility in Viana do Castelo in Portugal, which is about 30 miles from its currently rented site in Valen\u00e7a. The new building will expand production capacity of several environmentally friendly technologies such as EGR coolers and tubes as well as glow plug control modules. All of these are key technologies for the modern engine aimed at reducing emissions. Construction began in August of 2013, and we expect to be completed in 2014.","We've also expanded our campus in Rzesz\u00f3w, Poland, with a new production plant and engineering center. The production plant produces advanced chain-driven engine timing systems and also provides expanded capacity for transmission components. The new engineering center provides capabilities for application engineering and R&D. And production for several major European car manufacturers has already began.","BorgWarner's Eco-Launch solenoid valve has been named a finalist in the prestigious Automotive News PACE competition.","And last but not least, the company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock. The dividend is payable on November 15, 2013 to shareholders of record on November 1, 2013.","Now let me shift and talk about our current outlook for 2013 light vehicle production, which is essentially unchanged from our previous view. We still expect global production volume growth of approximately 2% in 2013 compared to the prior year. If we look at that regionally, we still expect North America to be up about 5%, China up about 10% and Europe down about 3%. The one notable change is our improved outlook for Japan, where we now expect production to be down 6% compared with our previous outlook of down 10%.","In commercial vehicle, the markets there remain challenging, although our overall expectations have improved due to high CV production in China. In Europe and North America, we expect production to be relatively flat compared with 2012, consistent with our previous outlook.","And in July we'd said that we are expecting CV production in China to be flat with 2012. However, the uncertainty surrounding Euro 4 emission standards was removed when it was decided to delay Euro 4 until the end of 2014. So as a result of this, production was stronger than expected in recent months, and we expect this trend to continue for the remainder of the year. And in Brazil we still expect double-digit growth in CV production.","Finally, our guidance for 2013 has also changed. Sales growth in 2013 is now expected to be between 3% and 4%, which is at the lower end of the previous guidance range of 3% to 5%. When you exclude 2012 dispositions, sales growth is now expected to be 4% to 5%. We now expect earnings to be $5.55 to $5.65 per share, which is up from the $5.40 to $5.55 per share. And our operating margin is now to be 12% or better, which is up from our previous guidance of approximately 12%. And Ron will provide more color on our guidance shortly.","So with the first 9 months of the year behind us, I'm increasingly confident that 2013 will be another strong year for BorgWarner. The macro environment is stabilizing but still has its challenges, especially in Europe. However, BorgWarner's record financial performance in the third quarter again underscored our operational proficiency and our ability to manage costs during challenging times.","As I look beyond 2013, I'm excited about what's ahead for the company. Our operations have performed at a high level, and I'm confident that this will continue. So as our sales growth improves, the combination of efficient operations and higher sales should result in tremendous earnings power for the company. The industry's adoption of our leading-edge powertrain technology will continue for years. And because of this, I feel very good about our company's future and believe that no company in the auto sector is better positioned for long term profitable growth than BorgWarner.","So with that now, I'll turn the call over to Ron.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Thank you, James, and good day, everyone. Before I begin reviewing the financials, I'd like to put BorgWarner's performance into perspective relative to the industry. Global light vehicle production was up 4% in the third quarter compared with the same quarter last year. BorgWarner's reported sales were up 7% from a year ago. As James explained earlier, if we exclude the impact of foreign currencies and M&A activity in 2012, our sales in the quarter were up 6%.","To get a clear picture of our performance relative to our markets, we need to review the light vehicle and commercial vehicle markets separately. First let's take a closer look at the light vehicle market from a regional perspective. In Asia, which I'm defining as China, Korea and Japan, light vehicle production was up 6%. Our vehicle -- light vehicle sales in Asia, excluding currency, were up 14%. In Europe, light vehicle production was up 2%. Our light vehicle sales, excluding currency and 2012 disposals, was also up 2%. In North America, light vehicle production was up 6%. Our light vehicle sales growth in North America was up 15%.","Now let's review commercial vehicle market. Global commercial vehicle production was higher in the third quarter, primarily due to higher volumes in China and Brazil, 2 of our smaller markets for commercial vehicle products. Commercial vehicle production in Europe and North America, our larger markets, was up slightly. Our commercial vehicle and aftermarket sales were down about 1% in the quarter, largely due to unfavorable customer mix.","To summarize, our typical outperformance of the light vehicle market by 8 to 10 percentage points was intact in Asia and North America in the third quarter.","In Europe, we were in line with the market. However, you may recall that our dual-clutch transmission, DCT, business in Europe was exceptionally strong a year ago, making a tough year-over-year comparison. Our performance relative to North America market has been a challenge in recent quarters as adoption of advanced powertrain technology continues to lag other markets. However, the ramp-up of new programs, especially in Drivetrain segment, along with strong light-truck sales, boosted our sales in the third quarter.","Working down the income statement, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 21% for the quarter. That's a 70-basis-point improvement from 20.3% a year ago. SG&A expenses were 8.7% of sales in the quarter, down slightly from 8.9% a year ago. R&D spending, which is included in SG&A, was 4% of sales in the third quarter, up 20 basis points from a year ago. This implies a 40-basis-point decline in SG&A spending, which we attribute to good execution of cost control plans.","Reported operating income in the quarter was $226 million, or 12.5% of sales, compared with $192 million, or 11.3% of sales, on a comparable basis, a sharp improvement from a year ago. The 12.5% operating margin is a new third quarter record for the company.","After excluding the impact of foreign currency and noncomparable items in the third quarter 2012, our incremental margin was about 36%, which is well above our mid-teens incremental margin target.","Our outstanding performance by operations. As a result of our strong performance through the first 3 quarters, we are raising our full year operating margin to 12% or better from approximately 12%. As you look further down the income statement, equity in affiliate earnings was $10 million in the quarter, down slightly from the $11 million last year. This represents the performance of NSK-Warner, our 50-50 joint venture in Japan, which sells transmission components to our Japanese customers in Japan and China, as well as TEL, our turbocharger joint venture in India.","Interest expense and finance charges were $8 million in the quarter, up from $5 million a year ago. Interest expense in the third quarter 2012 was lower to income from cross-currency swaps.","Provision for income taxes in the quarter on a reported basis was $56 million. However, this included approximately $6 million of favorable discrete adjustments, which you can read in our 10-Q. Excluding these adjustments, provisions for income taxes were about $62 million, which is a 27% effective tax rate, in line with our 2013 guidance.","Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest were $6.1 million in the quarter, up from $5.6 million a year ago. This line item reflects our minority partner share in the earnings performance of our Korean and Chinese consolidated joint ventures.","That brings us back to net earnings, which were $167 million in the quarter or $1.45 per share. On a comparable basis, net earnings were $1.40 per share, up 18% from $1.19 per share a year ago, outstanding performance for the company.","Now let's take a closer look at the operating groups. Engine Group sales were up $1.2 billion in the quarter. Excluding currency and 2012 dispositions, Engine Group sales were up 4% compared with the third quarter in 2012. Adjusted EBIT for the Engine Group was $196 million in the quarter, or 16.2% of sales. That's 40 basis points higher than the 15.8% reported a year ago. Excluding currency and 2012 dispositions, the group's year-over-year incremental margin was 32%, excellent performance for the Engine Group.","In the Drivetrain Group, sales were $604 million in the quarter. Excluding currency, Drivetrain Group sales were up 10% compared with the third quarter 2012. On a reported basis, adjusted EBIT was $66 million, or 10.9% of sales, sharply higher than the 8.3% of sales a year ago. The year-over-year incremental margin for Drivetrain Group, excluding currency, was 38%, which is outstanding performance and a third consecutive strong quarter for the Drivetrain Group. However, consistent performance from Drivetrain remains a concern and an area of focus for us.","If you look at the balance sheet and cash flow, we generated $515 million of net cash from operating activities in the first 9 months of 2013, down $28 million from the first 9 months of 2012. Capital spending was $298 million in the first 9 months of 2013, up $15 million from the same period a year ago. Our capital spending is required to support our program launches around the world, particularly in Asia, South America, Eastern Europe and Mexico.","Free cash flow during the period, which we define as net cash from operating activities less capital spending, was $217 million. Our free cash flow was used to repurchase 226 million of shares in the first 9 months of 2013. We purchased more than 2.6 million shares this year, leaving approximately 5.5 million shares on the current authorization.","Looking at the balance sheet itself. Balance sheet debt increased by $205 million compared with the end of 2012. Cash increased by $205 million during the same period, leaving net debt flat compared to the end of 2012. At the end of the third quarter, our net debt-to-capital ratio was 9.3%, down from 10% at the end of 2012 and below our target range of 15% to 30%. Net debt-to-EBITDA at the end of the third quarter on a trailing 12-month basis was 0.3x. Our capital structure remains in excellent shape.","Also, as James mentioned, the board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock, payable on November 15, 2013 to shareholders of record on November 1, 2013. The dividend is an important and stable component of our cash deployment strategy, which also includes capital expenditures to fund our organic growth, acquiring strategic assets and repurchasing shares. After CapEx and paying the dividend, our priority is strategic acquisitions. However, in the absence of a deal, repurchasing shares remains an option for us. We have repurchased approximately 6.8 million shares over the last 6 quarters.","Now I'd like to discuss our guidance for 2013, which has changed from what we provided in July. James reviewed our guidance at a high level. I'll discuss some of the finer points. Our sales growth expectations of 3% to 4%, or 4% to 5% excluding 2012 disposition, still assumes very little currency impact. The net impact of currencies in the first 9 months was small as the weakening yen and the Brazilian real partially offset the strengthening euro. We will continue to monitor foreign currencies and provide updates as needed.","We still expect raw material inflation of $15 million to $20 million in 2013 but now toward the lower end of that range. As James mentioned earlier, our operating income margin is now expected to be 12% or better in 2013, up from approximately 12%. Productivity gains and spending controls seen in the first 9 months of the year are expected to continue to drive strong results for the remainder of the year. Our expected diluted share count for 2013 is still expected to be approximately 116 million shares. This diluted share count guidance is based on share repurchases made to date. Any additional share repurchases that may be executed during the remainder of the year are not factored into our guidance.","And finally, our EPS guidance range is now $5.55 to $5.65 per diluted share, up from $5.40 to $5.55 per diluted share previously. Both the current and previous guidance ranges excluded noncomparable items. The guidance raise is due to better-than-expected performance from our operations.","So we continue to be confident in our ability to execute in any market. This company has demonstrated a heightened focus on efficiency and cost controls since the 2009 recession. This focus resulted in highly efficient growth and record margins in each of the last 3 years. Weak market conditions, particularly in Europe, will likely result in sales growth below our long-term trend in 2013. Despite this, 2013 should be another year of record sales and record profits for BorgWarner. Over the long term, we intend to execute our growth strategy and over the short term remain focused on efficiency regardless of the direction of the market.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ken.","Ken Lamb","Thanks, Ron. Now let's move to the Q&A portion of the call. Cherry, please remind everyone of the Q&A procedure.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Ron, your comment on Drivetrain, so the margin was really good this quarter, and you said there could be some volatility going forward. So what are the kind of the key factors we should consider from a margin standpoint going forward in Drivetrain? Because this is a pretty impressive performance, and I just want to know -- get some color on the potential sustainability of it.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Rich, Q3 saw outstanding progress in absolute Drivetrain margins, there's no question. But sustainability, consistency, operational execution and footprint opportunity still exist in that segment. Final review of the segment business plan for 2014 and beyond continues to be under our review. So basically, what I'm saying is we still have some underlying issues that we haven't solved.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So the read-through on that is we shouldn't assume 10% on a straight line basis going forward here.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","No, I don't want you to assume 10% on a straight line at this point until we give further notice on that, okay?","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then the European production assumption for the year, the down 3%, James, maybe you can discuss this. So IHS has improved their outlook since July. You're worse than that. What are the puts and takes within that?","James R. Verrier","Rich, we started the year with a 3%, and as the year's gone through, we pretty much stayed to that course. And we still feel it's a pretty good number for us, that 3% down. The view that we have right now is that probably we're a little more conservative than others. We still get a little bit of rumblings around what's going to happen right at the end of the year in terms of shutdown activity. And that picture will get clearer over the next few weeks. It's still a little early to get real good visibility. But we do have some general signals and indications that there could be shutdown periods that would get us close to that number that we're at, Rich. And again, we'll know more in the next month as we get closer. But that's kind of where we're landing right now.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just last one for me. On Drivetrain, can you remind us when you start to go against easier comparisons on the DCT? Your volume, and I know you mentioned that last quarter, was an issue this quarter in terms of your outgrowth in Europe. Just when does that start to ease for you, just as a reminder?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","I would say more first half of next year, Rich. All right?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","James, you announced that you're adding more greenfield Europe capacity. Clearly, that has to do with the penetration gains you're seeing in the region. But there always has been this impression that your growth areas are going to be more U.S., and China and Europe is more of a mature market for Engine and Drivetrain technologies. Can you just address why you see the need to add more capacity in Europe right now and what its overall capacity situation is?","James R. Verrier","Yes, we still -- the simple answer really is we still continue to see growth in Europe for BorgWarner. So as we grow the business in Europe, which we'll continue to do over the next several years, what you see us doing is, in principle, putting our incremental capacity into lower-cost regions of the world. And you see that, the examples that we've talked about this morning, in Portugal and Poland, respectively. So the way to think of it is it's the way that we're positioning ourselves around future growth in Europe. What you may be thinking is our growth rate in China and in potentially in North America could be ahead of Europe, but we're still planning to grow at a good rate in Europe as we go forward.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. Do you plan to close any European capacity as you grow that low-cost European capacity?","James R. Verrier","We're not in a position to talk about that specifically today. I'd rather not discuss that in detail.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. Just moving on. A question for you, Ron, and I apologize if I missed this. Did you quantify any Latin America FX impact in the quarter?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","I did make reference to the Brazilian real slightly when I said that euro gains were offset by Brazilian reais and Japanese yen. That was in the script, Ravi.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Oh, so it was an offset?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Yes, it was an offset.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And just finally, can you remind us again about your margins in the CV business? As that cyclically rebounds in the next year or 2, hopefully, do you see that being a margin tailwind?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Well, we've been very transparent about how we price our products on a return on invested capital, Ravi. I wouldn't see any tailwind from margin. Tailwind from volume would be very nice, but not from the margin perspective.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc Capital.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I guess, a few different questions here. First, from a revenue growth standpoint, 6% topline growth adjusted versus production 4%, I would say it's a little bit lighter than maybe your backlogs, but yet you're comparing it to global light vehicle production. So I guess what I'm wondering is, can you kind of reconcile your backlog growth expectations versus the end market production actually. How much did you outgrow in Europe? How much did you outgrow in North America, that sort of thing?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Well, Brett, I'm going to start, and maybe James [ph] will come in and supplement. So we outperformed the market in North America by our historical levels of 8% to 10%. Asia, I think it was about 8 points. North America was about 9. In Europe, we were in line with the market in the quarter. A lot of that had to do with unfavorable customer mix for us. So we continue to work through our issues in Europe, and the market itself is sort of it feels like it's bottomed, and it's -- well, we don't know about a recovery at this point. And our performance relative to that market is still -- it's not as strong as we'd like. And we're going to talk more about that next week when we have our backlog announcement.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then just switching gears, just thinking about margins. Your sales outlook looks pretty good. Your contribution margins are very good this quarter. And I presume that -- what I'm wondering is what are some of the headwinds that you might face that would prevent you from continuing to see margin expansion into 2014 or into 2015? What would be some of those offsets?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Well, okay Brett. First of all, we don't intend to reduce our margins. We've been very clear about that. But the headwinds, getting back to that, for 2014 we've talked about that we deferred some structural costs, and those would have to come in, so that would be a headwind. R&D spending, if you've been tracking it, has been -- we're pushing 4%. We were down as low as 3.6% of sales in the last year. We continue to want to make those investments. I wouldn't call it a headwind because that's an investment side, but it does come as far as against our margins. So those are 2 main areas that we would see going into 2014. But again, I want to stress not at the expense of deteriorating our margins.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then capital deployment. Can you talk about acquisitions versus share repurchase? You seem to be repurchasing somewhere in the pace of $50 million to $100 million per quarter. Any reason to believe that goes up or down significantly, and then can you just update us on your current thoughts on acquisitions? Anything imminent?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","I will first address the share repurchases. We've been on track of what I would rather phrase is capital deployment of cash of about $100 million a quarter, Brett. And I think that pretty much balanced me out throughout the year with the cash I've generated. Remember, I have to keep my other eye open on M&A activity, so I'm balancing the switch between when we have M&A activity versus the share repurchases. but I think the $100 million to use is probably a good benchmark, what would be done as far as my behavior, what I've done in the past, I would use maybe going forward. But I would have James, and we can give an update on M&A activity.","James R. Verrier","Yes, Brett, I would characterize the M&A activity as first of all, still our primary use of capital [ph]. I mean, that remains at the top of our list to drive additional growth and additional technology for the company. The activity level, if that makes sense, is still very strong. We continue to be tracking and engaged in discussions with a number of targets. And I think we've said in past, we would be somewhat disappointed if we didn't get a transaction completed towards the end of this year or early next year. And I think that's still a good -- how we feel. I can't talk about the specific companies, but I will tell you the amount of targets that we've we described in the past of about approximately 30 or so companies that are in the mix that we're looking at is about the same. That list is relatively dynamic. A couple will fall off as we get further into discussions, and we're in the process of other companies getting added in. So it's a pretty dynamic process, and I would tell you that a couple of those targets are at relatively advanced levels or advanced stages of discussions. So in summary, Brett, it's still our primary use of capital, and we're very, very aggressively internally managing it and focused on it and feel comfortable that we'll be able to bring 1 or 2 of these deals through over the next 6 to 12 months.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citigroup.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just want to follow up on the earlier question on the Drivetrain margin. Ron, you were very clear that the 10.9% probably is going to be lumpy and it shouldn't be straight line going forward. As we kind of get to some of your initiatives in the next couple of years, do you think that segment could eventually get to something like a 10.9%, 11% margin, say in next 2 or 3 years?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","So Itay, I'm going to go back to what we've been saying pretty much all summer. Our first goal is to get it at 10% double-digit, 10% consistently, the 10.2%, 10.3%. I don't -- but at this point, I'm not comfortable going to 10.9%, to be honest. I just wanted to get a consistent double-digit, and that's our first goal.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And then just to clarify an earlier point. Could you share what you're assuming for the fourth quarter in terms of European light vehicle production, maybe just percentage up or down now year-over-year?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","They're both looking at me, Itay, so I will -- here's the thing. We have to back into the math. So our full year is about 3%. Whatever that works out to for a quarterly basis, we have to back into that. Just to be clear, that minus 3%, it's not to the decimal. It's still an approximation. We recognize that there's probably some potential for it to be slightly better than that. But based on, as James said, some of the signals that we're getting from the market, we felt more comfortable leaving it at minus 3% for now.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And then just 2 last cash flow questions. One, it does seem, Ron, the CapEx might be running a bit lower than the full year guidance, even with some seasonality that you typically increase in the fourth quarter. Maybe just address that. And then secondly, going back to Brett's question around cash deployment with substantial free cash flow, kind of guided for the fourth quarter, is there any reason why you might not actually accelerate some of the share repurchase activity?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Okay. Let me talk about the CapEx spending. Historically, we saw that the fourth quarter tends to be higher than the rest of the quarters throughout the year. But with that said, we are probably going to trend a little bit lower than my guidance -- not my guidance range, but the low end of my guidance range on CapEx spending. And if you go back in history, this actually happened last year as well. But so -- it will be in the lower end. Let's talk about share repurchases. Although we have cash-positive positions in the United States, you guys have to remember the majority of our cash generation is and will continue to be in lower, more competitive jurisdictions, tax jurisdictions outside of the United States. So with that said, we have been implementing an efficient repatriation strategy that should be in place in 2014, and that will increase our flexibility and cash use in the United States. So the message here is that I am still somewhat handicapped by repatriation concerns, although we are working on them. So to answer your question about accelerating the repurchases, until I get my repatriation strategy in place, it will be somewhat limited to me on my repurchases, okay?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America.","John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It's John Lovallo on for John Murphy. First question on the Drivetrain Group. The strength there, would you say that some of that was attributable to TorqTransfer content on Ford's trucks?","James R. Verrier","Yes. That's correct.","John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then on the Engine Group, EGR coolers were called out as an area of strength. Could you just remind us what percentage is on-highway versus off-highway there?","James R. Verrier","I don't have a detailed split for you. I'd say the bulk of our EGR cooler business is light vehicle, it's [ph] weighted to light vehicle. We do participate in commercial vehicle, you're correct. But I'd say the significant majority of our EGR cooler business is tied to the light vehicle segment.","John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then finally, realizing we're going to get a backlog update here shortly, could you just talk about just recent quoting activity, how has that been trending relative to the past 6 months or so?","James R. Verrier","Yes, we'll provide obviously a little more color as we go into the backlog meeting here in a few days. But quoting activity has been good for BorgWarner, both in terms of the amount of quoting activity around the world, and we feel very good and comfortable about kind of the win\/loss ratio of programs that we're bidding on. So good, solid, typical BorgWarner performance is probably the way I would characterize it, and we'll give a little more update over the next couple of weeks. But it's so far, so good.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It's actually Pat Archambault on for Rob. Most of my questions have been answered, but I just wanted to dive into the revenue guidance, taking down the top end of the range a bit. Is the biggest driver of that this unfavorable customer mix you talked about in Europe in the third quarter?","James R. Verrier","I would say it's a couple of things. One is a little bit of the mix issue that Ken alluded to in the third quarter in Europe. Some of it is what I talked a little bit about earlier with the -- in our view a little bit of uncertainty remaining in the fourth quarter as we come to the end of the year. And the third element that I don't want us to forget is commercial vehicle, which is about 15% of the company. And I think you guys know very well that's somewhat of a challenging environment right now, pretty much in most parts of the world other than maybe Brazil. So when you put those 3 things together, that's kind of what drives us to where we're at right now.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. And this is a bit of a detailed question, so maybe I'll take it offline, if you guys don't have [ph] it. But just mechanically, when we think about your backlog, if you have a large existing program that has a good amount of shutdown within a year, does that typically reflect in your net backlog? So if there's a large program that had a bunch of downtime within a year, would that be an adjustment down to your backlog?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","So you're saying there would be a change in the expectations because of an unexpected shutdown?","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Well, it's not unexpected. But say you have a large program, your existing -- it's an existing business but it's a business that's changing over within a given year, so there's a couple of months of shutdown of that program. Does that work against your net backlog announcement or is that kind of -- is that a separate kind of detail like...","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Yes, I understand the question now. So if it's an existing program and something like that would occur, that does not affect the backlog.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Spak with RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered as well. I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit of color maybe just even order of magnitude of the -- on the cost side, you talked -- you highlighted productivity gains versus cost controls. And obviously, one of those is a little bit more sustainable. You've been pretty vocal about some of those cost controls having to creep back in over the coming years. So how should we think about just the split between those 2 thus far this year?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Joe, that's -- if you kind of compared the third quarter year-over-year, that is going to be a little bit different than maybe what we've done in the prior 2 quarters, and I'll explain this, in that Drivetrain margin substantially increased year-over-year, and a lot of that was basically predicated on operational efficiencies in one of our business units' product lines. We struggled last year. Some higher volumes like in DCT. So that component was more driven by productivity and operational efficiencies. In the first 2 quarters of the year, I would say it was more weighted toward cost controls. So year-to-date average, I don't know where it's at. I'd have to do some math. So you have a little of a mixed bag year-to-date on those 2 items. I think going forward, you probably -- I would say more was weighted to cost controls in the SG&A line. Think of it as a GP number versus your SG&A lines. I think that's where the answer comes in. The growth in GP number is more based on operational execution, and the SG&A line will be more based on cost controls.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then just -- and obviously, we'll get more color on this next week. But can we just think about the relative growth between the 2 segments? I mean, can you help us better understand how that should progress? Obviously, the Drivetrain Group is a smaller group, and I think you're beginning to finally have, as we go forward, certainly some of the China DCT coming in. But by the same token, obviously turbo penetration has continued to increase. So, I mean, shouldn't the growth between the 2 be relatively consistent? Do you see Drivetrain as a larger grower going forward?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Yes, Joe, we'll give a little more detail, of course, next week so you can get that 3-year view. And in our usual fashion, we'll show that by, obviously, regionally and by product line. When I look at the portfolio as a whole for the company, all of the products that we have in provide opportunity for growth at a very good rate for us. So when I take that into account, we're expecting to see above-industry growth rates in all of our product lines. And sometimes it's a little cyclical, where, say, turbo has got a natural momentum around penetration rates. If you contrast that to maybe DCT, that's more of a still an emerging-adoption technology that might be a little slower. You see a trend right now to, I'd say, a more accelerated penetration rate around EGR cooler products on gasoline engines. So it'll vary a little bit in the product life cycle, Joe. But in general, we expect above average growth -- industry growth on both the Drivetrain and the Engine segments.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And what about just your turbo positioning in China? If you could compare that maybe to some of the global market share statistics you've talked about in the past.","James R. Verrier","The way I would encourage you to think about this is we've said pretty consistently our market share position in turbo combined is about a 1\/3 share of the market. And there's not a whole lot of differentiation around the world when you look at that share. If you look across the products, there's not a big difference either when I'm in gasoline and diesel. So think of China, think of North America, think of Europe and that 1\/3 share. It may vary a little bit, but think of it -- I would think of it consistently around the world of us not only having that position but continuing to maintain that position on a go-forward basis in all regions of the world.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS.","Rahul Chadha - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","This is Rahul Chadha for Colin. I just wanted to dig in a little deeper on the performance in Europe. Can you provide any color on the negative customer mix you talked about? And German OEM production seemed pretty strong this quarter. So is the underperformance related to diesel penetration or any specific product?","James R. Verrier","I'd obviously like to stay away from any specific details about individual customers. And it's -- I would just say to you it's a little bit of a mixed bag when you look at all of Europe. And I think the way you have to think about that is for sure there could be model mix shifts between diesel and gas; there could be mix shifts between customer shares on certain applications. And when you put all of that together, that's what drives it. It's no one specific product or no one specific customer, so I wouldn't think of it in those terms. I would think of it as just an aggregate of all the variants that play out there in Europe and how it affects us as a supplier.","Rahul Chadha - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That's helpful. And in general, how have the diesel mix been trending over the last few quarters in Europe?","James R. Verrier","Generally pretty stable. So think of it in the low 50% type number. And it varies. It could move a point or 2 during a particular quarter or to quarter comparison. But it's relatively stable through the year. And if you -- just another comment there is as that mix shift occurs, a percent or so either way, it doesn't have a material impact on BorgWarner. And that's fundamentally driven by the content that we have on gasoline engines and gasoline vehicles continues to grow and increase. So it's not a material impact on BorgWarner but generally consistent in the low 50s diesel share in Europe.","Rahul Chadha - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And then just once again, digging deeper into the Drivetrain margin. Was there any onetime benefit in the Q3 margin or any help from the China JV ramp?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","No, there was no significant onetimers or any significant tailwind from China.","Operator","We have time for one final question. And that question comes from Dave Leiker with Robert W. Baird.","Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","This is Joe on the line for David. First one, a lot of your growth historically came from having technologies and pretty attractive secular themes that drive the outgrowth. But when I look at the transmission market today, it seems like a lot of the OEMs are having quality issues with their drivetrain suppliers. So I'm just wondering, given your, let's say, quality reputation, are you seeing share gains accelerate, and what is maybe some of the more mature or slower growing product opportunities that could help you accelerate your outgrowth?","James R. Verrier","From a -- a couple of things, Joe, from a drivetrain point of view, we're not experiencing quality issues in those products. I think you've got a good assumption there. I think there's continued areas of opportunity for technology innovation and invention. We've talked about the migration to DCT continues to be a trend that we see playing out in Europe, and particularly China, which will be a key growth opportunity for the company. I think you've also seen our -- in this call an evidence or an example of the ever-increasing adoption of stop\/start technology, and BorgWarner participated with some very innovative solenoid technology that's helping the automakers on stop\/start solutions and fuel economy solutions. So there is continued evolution and opportunity for innovation and growth for BorgWarner on the transmission side of the business. And we'll share a little more on how that plays out in more detail next week, Joe. But I think your assumption is right where it's a good opportunity for additional growth for us.","Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Great. Maybe shifting over to the commercial vehicle piece of your business. I'm wondering if you could just remind me what the maybe market growth assumption was embedded in the backlog last year. Because even though things were getting worse last year and I'm sure that sentiment is reflected in the backlog, I think the lack of a V-shaped recovery in '13 and really into '14 has been tripping up commercial vehicle suppliers so far. So maybe just if you could weigh in on whether that's going to weigh on your business as well.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","So I'm going to speak specifically to this year. And you're right. We didn't actually give any detailed estimates for commercial vehicle production, but we do expect more recovery this year than what we're actually seeing. So, yes, that has played into this a bit. And again, next week we'll talk more about how we see things going forward. But you are correct. For 2013 things did not materialize as we had thought that they would.","Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then my last one. If I just look at the equity income line item, it's down a little bit year-over-year, but you had pretty negative headwinds from the rupee and yen in there. So can you maybe just give an organic growth rate, what those businesses are growing at?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","They typically are in line with BorgWarner growth rate. But you're right, Joe. That is what it's -- I didn't say that in my script, but it's really more currency is what's driving that negative over last year, more so than the volume side of it.","Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So if BorgWarner outgrew the Asian markets by 8%, those JVs are probably doing likewise, 8%?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Yes, we have 2 main joint ventures. One of them is in India, on TEL, turbocharger business, which obviously is a good growing business. And the other one is in Japan, which I'd say would be less than the turbocharger business but still growing.","Ken Lamb","I'd like to thank you all again for joining us.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2013 Second Quarter Results Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Ken Lamb, Director, Investor Relations. Mr. Lamb, you may begin your conference.","Ken Lamb","Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. We issued our earnings release this morning at approximately 8 AM Eastern Time. It's posted on our website, borgwarner.com, on our Investors homepage. A replay of today's conference call will be available through August 1. The dial number for the replay is (800) 585-8367. You'll need the conference ID, which is 10514936. The replay will also be available on our website.","With regard to our IR calendar, we will be attending a number of conferences over the next few months. August 13, we'll be at the JPMorgan Auto Conference in New York. September 10, we'll be at the MainFirst Auto IAA Investor & Analyst Conference in Frankfurt, Germany.

Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today.","Now moving on to our results, James Verrier, President and CEO, will comment on second quarter results and current industry trends. And then Ron Hundzinski, our CFO, will discuss the details of our operating results and also our outlook for the remainder of 2013.","With that, I'll turn it over to James.","James R. Verrier","So thank you, Ken, and good day, to everybody. Today, I'm very pleased to review our second quarter results, as well as our second quarter accomplishments. First of all, I'd like to congratulate all of the BorgWarner employees on an excellent second quarter. Your efforts drove outstanding results in a challenging environment.","So now let me talk about our results. Reported sales were $1.9 billion, which is up 3% from a year ago, excluding the impact of foreign currencies and dispositions made in the last 12 months. U.S. GAAP earnings were $1.50 per share, which is a new quarterly record for the company. Our reported operating income margin was 12.9%, which is also a new quarterly record, and represents outstanding performance by our operations. So despite low production levels in Europe for both light and commercial vehicles, our operational efficiency and cost controls enabled us to post a strong operating margin in these conditions.","Let me talk a little bit about the Engine Group, where the second quarter sales were $1.3 billion, which is up 4% from a year ago after excluding the impact of foreign currencies and dispositions made during the last 12 months. Results were led by higher sales of turbochargers, EGR coolers and engine timing systems in China and also turbocharger sales in Brazil.","In the Drivetrain Group, sales were just under $620 million, which is up 2% from the second quarter 2012 when we exclude foreign currencies. The Drivetrain results were driven by higher sales of all-wheel drive systems in North America and all-wheel drive systems and transmission components in Korea.","As we look to the future, BorgWarner continues to invest for the long term. Capital spending continues to grow, and in the quarter, we spent about 5.7% of sales and we remain committed to supporting our future growth and productivity improvements.","Our spending for R&D was about 3.8% of sales in the quarter, which is just under our targeted level for R&D spending of 4%.","I'm also proud to review some exciting announcements that we made during the quarter. First of all, BorgWarner will provide turbochargers for Jaguar Land Rover's new family of 4-cylinder gasoline and diesel engines, which we expect to launch in 2015. Now to support JLR's new engine manufacturing center near Wolverhampton in the U.K., BorgWarner plans to expand its existing production lines and also build a new engineering center in nearby Bradford. In addition to this, BorgWarner is establishing a Master's degree program in turbocharger engineering at the University of Huddersfield, also in close proximity.","BorgWarner also supplies its leading twin scroll turbocharging technology for Hyundai's new 1.6-liter turbo gas direct injection engine available on the Veloster Turbo in both the U.S. and Europe. This turbocharged engine is nearly 50% more powerful than Hyundai's standard 1.6 GDI engine.","Also, BorgWarner supplies its latest EGR coolers for Renault's 1.6-liter diesel engine, which is available on the European Sc\u00e9nic and M\u00e9gane, as well as Nissan's crossover, the Qashqai. BorgWarner's advanced EGR cooler helps improve fuel economy up to 3% while also helping to achieve upcoming Euro 6 emission standards.","BorgWarner's DCT joint venture in China has recently started delivery of its DualTronic control modules and clutch modules for SAIC Motor Corp. new 6 wet speed (sic) [6-speed wet] dual-clutch transmission. This is the first developed completely in-house by a domestic Chinese automaker.","Last but not the least on the highlights, on July 24 2013, the company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock. And Ron will provide more detail on the dividend during his discussions of capital allocation strategy.","Now I would like to review the current outlook for 2013 light vehicle production, which is improved slightly from our previous view. We're now expecting global production volume growth of approximately 2% in 2013 compared with our previous outlook of 1% growth. The increase is primarily due to an improved outlook for North America. We're now expecting production volumes growth of 5% in 2013 compared with 3% previously. As we look at the rest of our key markets, we still expect Europe to be down 3%, China up 10%, and Japan down 10%.","In the commercial vehicle markets, our overall expectations are unchanged. We still expect stability in 2013 but not much growth. So in Europe and North America, we expect production to be relatively flat compared with 2012, which is consistent with our previous outlook.","However, our view on CV production in China has improved. In April, we said that we were expecting a double-digit decline in 2013 CV volumes. However, a strong first half has changed that view. So we're now expecting CV production in China to be flat with 2012 levels. And in Brazil, we still expect double-digit growth, and a strong half that we've seen supports that view.","Finally, our sales and earnings guidance for 2013 has changed. Sales growth in 2013 is now expected to be 3% to 5%, or 4% to 6% when you exclude 2012 dispositions. And our 2013 earnings guidance is now $5.40 to $5.55 per share. And our operating margin guidance is now approximately 12% for the year. And Ron will provide a little more color on our guidance shortly.","So with a strong first half of 2013 behind us, I'm increasingly confident that 2013 will be another very strong year for BorgWarner. The macro environment is improving but still has its challenges, especially in Europe. However, BorgWarner's record financial performance in the second quarter underscored our operational proficiency and our ability to manage costs during challenging times.","And as I look beyond 2013, I'm excited about what I see ahead for this company. Our operations have performed at a high level, and I'm confident that this will continue. And as our sales growth improves, the combination of our efficient operations and higher sales outlook should result in tremendous earnings power for our company.","I believe no company in the auto sector is better positioned for long-term profitable growth than BorgWarner. The industry's adoption of our leading-edge powertrain technology will continue for years, and because of this, I feel very, very good about our company's future.","So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ron.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Thank you, James, and good day, everyone. Before I begin reviewing the financials, I'd like to put BorgWarner's performance into perspective relative to the industry. Global light vehicle production was up 3% in the second quarter compared with the same quarter last year. BorgWarner's reported sales were up 2% from a year ago. As James explained earlier, if we exclude the impact of foreign currencies and M&A activity in 2012, our sales in the quarter were up 3%. To get a clear picture of our performance relative to our markets, we need to review the light vehicle and commercial vehicle markets separately.","First, let's take a closer look at the light vehicle market from a regional perspective. In Asia, which we define as China, Korea and Japan, light vehicle production was up 2%. Our light vehicle sales in Asia, excluding currency, were up 10%. In Europe, light vehicle production was up 1%. On-road vehicle sales, excluding currency in 2012 dispositions, were up 1%.","In North America, light vehicle production was up 5%, our light vehicle sales growth in North America was up 3%, slightly below the market.","Now let's review the commercial vehicle market. Commercial vehicle production was mixed in the quarter. Production was up in Brazil and China but lower in North America and Europe. As a result, our commercial vehicle and aftermarket sales were up about 1% in the quarter. So our typical outperformance of light vehicle market by 8 to 10 percentage points was intact in Asia in the second quarter.","In Europe, our customer mix was weighted toward those customers who underperformed the overall market. Also, you may recall that our DCT business in Europe was exceptionally strong a year ago, making it a tough year-over-year comparison. Our performance relative to North American market continues to be a challenge as the adoption of advanced powertrain technology continues to lag other markets. We expect this to improve over time.","Now working down the income statement, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 20.9% for the quarter. That's up slightly from 20.6% a year ago. The impact of raw material prices in the quarter was minimal.","SG&A expenses were 8.2% of sales in the quarter, in line with the second quarter of 2012. R&D spending, which is included in SG&A line, was 3.8% of sales in the second quarter, up 20 basis points from a year ago. This implies a 20-basis-point decline in other SG&A spending, which was attributed to good execution of cost control.","Reported operating income in the quarter was $243 million or 12.9% of sales compared with $231 million or 12.5% of sales on a comparable basis a year ago. The 12.9% operating margin is a new quarterly record for the company.","After excluding the impact of foreign currency and noncomparable items in the second quarter 2012, our incremental margin was around 30%, which is above our targeted 20%, which is outstanding performance by our operations. As we saw in our strong first half, we are raising our full year operating margin target to approximately 12% from 11.5% or better.","As you further -- as we look further down the income statement, equity in affiliate earnings was $11 million in the quarter, down slightly from $13 million last year. This represents the performance of NSK-Warner, our 50-50 joint venture in Japan, which sells transmission components to our Japanese customers in Japan and China, as well as TEL, our turbocharger joint venture in India. Light vehicle production was down in Japan and flat in India for the quarter.","Interest expense and finance charges were $9 million in the quarter, down from $13 million a year ago. This was primarily due to some income from the company's cross currency swaps.","Provision for income taxes was $67 million in the quarter, which is a 27% effective tax rate, in line with our 2013 guidance.","Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests were $6 million in the quarter, up slightly from $5.6 million a year ago. This line represents our minority partner's share in the earnings performance of our Korean and Chinese consolidated joint ventures.","Earnings per share. That brings us back here to the earnings -- I'm sorry, earnings per share, which were $174 million in the quarter, or $1.50 per share, up 10% from $1.36 per share a year ago on a comparable basis. Again, outstanding performance for the company.","Now let's take a closer look at our operating groups. Engine Group sales were $1.2 billion in the quarter. Excluding currency and 2012 dispositions, Engine Group sales were up 4% compared with the second quarter in 2012. Adjusted EBIT for the Engine Group was $220 million in the quarter or 17.1% of sales. That's 50 basis points higher than the 16.6% reported a year ago and a new quarterly record for the Engine Group as well. Excluding currency in 2012 dispositions, our year-over-year incremental margin was 33%. Excellent performance for the Engine Group.","In the Drivetrain Group, sales were $614 million in the quarter. Excluding currency, Drivetrain Group sales were up 2% compared with the second quarter in 2012. Unreported adjusted EBIT was $60 million or 9.7% of sales, up from 9.2% of sales a year ago. The year-over-year incremental margin for the Drivetrain Group, excluding currency, was 47%, which is great performance.","The group has been inconsistent, and it is our view that there is room for improvement in Drivetrain in profit levels and in performing consistency. We are focusing our attention on improving the group's performance.","Let's move to the balance sheet. Cash flow -- balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $300 million of net cash from operating activities in the first half of 2013, down $10 million from the first half of 2012. Capital spending was $195 million in the quarter, up $7 million from the same period a year ago. Our capital spending this quarter supported our program launches around the world, particularly in Asia, South America, Eastern Europe and Mexico. Free cash flow during the period, which we define as net cash from operating activities less capital spending, was $105 million.","Looking at the balance sheet itself, balance sheet net -- balance sheet debt increased by $163 million compared with the end of 2012. Cash increased by $101 million during the same period. This $62 million increase in net debt was primarily due to $150 million of share repurchases in the first half of 2013, less our $105 million of free cash flow. We purchased about 1.9 million shares in the first half of 2013, leaving approximately 6.3 million shares on the current authorization.","At the end of the quarter, our net debt-to-capital ratio was 11.3%, which is below our targeted range of 15% to 30%, but up from 10% at the end of 2012. Net debt-to-EBITDA at the end of the second quarter on a trailing 12-month basis was 0.4x. Our capital structure remains in excellent shape.","Also, as James mentioned, we have reinstated the dividend. The board has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 a share of common stock payable on August 15, 2013 to shareholders of record of August 5, 2013. At current share price levels, the yield will be between 1% and 1.5%, which is in line with historical levels.","The dividend is an important and stable component of our cash deployment strategy, which also includes capital expenditures to fund our organic growth, our core and strategic assets and repurchasing shares. After CapEx and paying a dividend, our priority is in strategic acquisitions. However, in the absence of a deal, repurchasing shares remains an option for us, and we repurchased over 6 million shares in the last 5 quarters.","Now I'd like to discuss our guidance for 2013, which has changed from what was provided in April. James reviewed our guidance at a high level, but I'd like to discuss some of the finer points. Our sales growth expectation of 3% to 5%, or 4% to 6% excluding 2012 dispositions, still assumes no currency impact. The net impact of foreign currencies in the first half was small as the weakening Japanese yen and the Brazilian real nearly offset the strength in euro. We will continue to monitor foreign currencies and provide updates as needed. We still expect raw material inflation of $15 million to $20 million in 2013, but now toward the lower end of that range.","As we mentioned earlier, our operating income margin is now expected to be approximately 12% in 2013, which is up from the 11.5% or better. In other words, we now expect to improve our margins this year compared with 2012. Productivity gains and spending controls seen in the first half are expected to drive strong results for the remainder of the year. Our expected diluted share count for 2013 has changed. Our previous EPS guidance was based on $117 million diluted shares, which was our share count at the end of 2012. However, due to the first half share repurchase activity, our new full year average diluted share count is expected to be 116 million shares. For those of you monitoring our financials, that's approximately 116.3 million in the first half and approximately 115.5 million shares in the second half. This diluted share count guidance is based on share repurchases made to date. Any additional share repurchases that we may execute during the remainder of the year are not factored into our guidance.","Finally, our EPS guidance range is now $5.40 to $5.55 per diluted share, up from $5.15 to $5.45 per diluted share previously. Both the current and previous guidance range exclude noncomparable items, of course. About $0.05 of the guidance raise is due to a lower share count based on share repurchases made to date. The remainder is due to better-than-expected performance from our operations.","So we continue to be confident in our ability to execute in any market. This company has demonstrated a heightened focus on efficiency and cost controls since the 2009 recession. This focus resulted in a highly efficient growth and record margins in each of the last 3 years. Weak market conditions, particularly in Europe, will likely result in sales growth below our long term trend in 2013. Despite this, 2013 should be another year of record sales and record profits for BorgWarner. Over the long term, we intend to execute our growth strategy, and over the short term, remained focused on efficiency regardless of the direction of the market.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ken.","Ken Lamb","Thanks, Ron. Now let's move to the Q&A portion of the call. Stephanie, could you announce the Q&A procedure again?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","James, on the margin performance, very strong this quarter. Anything unique that helped the quarter? It sounded like a lot of those, productivity. But anything that you would call out as being abnormally good? And then with the guide for the back half of the year, it implies a stepdown in the margin, the overall margin. You get some -- you usually get some seasonal decline in Q3. But are you expecting anything changing on the mix front or in terms of the operating environment, the macro environment that is included in the guidance?","James R. Verrier","Yes, Rich. Let me address the first one, to start with. There was nothing really unique to our -- that unique. It was just solid performance, and I think significantly across all of our products and all of our segments of the business. I think that the teams around the world just did an outstanding job executing on good plans that we'd put together earlier in the year. So we acknowledge a lower growth environment. And it was just very, very solid execution, no unique things, which is terrific. And I would say, Rich, by and large, that performance, that strong performance is what we're continuing forward within the rest of the year. You're right. When you do comparables first half to second half, there's a little bit of a seasonality impact in Q3. And to some extent, Q4 as well, Rich, when you consider the holiday season at the end of the year. So that does factor in a little bit. And then there's a little bit in the second half of the year, there's a little bit of incremental spend promoting around R&D that factors in as well, which we feel good. Those are the main highlights, I think for me. I think your other question, Rich, about our view from the market side is nothing's really changed there. Our view in our biggest market, which is Europe, we were talking around that 3% reduction level '12 through '13. That's what we've seen consistently through the year, and that's what we're seeing as the rest of the year plays out. And I think as you look at the other regions of the world, no meaningful shift there. And from a mix perspective, Rich, in terms of whether that's diesel versus gas or platforms, nothing really meaningfully different from where we were when we talked in April. So hopefully, did that -- did I get all your questions, Rich?","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes. And just a quick follow-up, Ron, on the Drivetrain margin. So pretty good performance this quarter. You called out still a focus there and room for improvement. But did this quarter's performance provide any more optimism for you about the state of the business and where it could go and make you feel better about where you need -- where you can go there? Any comments or color there would be helpful.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Okay. Rich, we've been very vocal this first half of the year about we wanting consistency and the absolute level of profitability in the Drivetrain Group. I like -- we like what we saw in the quarter, but the consistency is still a concern for us. It's still -- we're bouncing around too much for us. So I wouldn't add any more flavor around that other than the fact that we continue to do deep dives on this business unit and what I think we are very comfortable where we're going to go with this in the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc Capital.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just to follow on with Rich's question on the Drivetrain business. Do you have any specific longer-term targets? I think you had mentioned one last quarter, and it seems like you already exceeded that with this quarter's results. But do you have any specific longer-term targets? And then maybe more specifically, we're talking about the Drivetrain business, of course. And more specifically, what are your -- what's your strategy? What do you hope to change there specifically to allow you to maybe improve the consistency or improve the margins?","James R. Verrier","Yes. Brett, I think I would say this. First of all, we are encouraged and pleased with the direction of the business. If we go back a year or so to where we are now, it's certainly moved forward, and that's encouraging. So that's a good thing for us. We've not laid out a very, very specific target. We have said and we continue to say that we believe the Drivetrain business can be a double-digit margin business. We feel comfortable that we can get to there. In terms of what are we looking at kind of thing question, there's a couple of areas that I think are key to us. We talked in prior calls around the China growth, the DCT. And we see the good news in this quarter that we're starting to see that come on. But getting the next acceleration there is a good key part of the growth. Just like all of our products and all of our businesses, we always look to optimize our footprint around the world, and that's an area that we're paying good attention to. Because this is a growth business, the Drivetrain business we see is very strategic. That's a growth business. And as we drive that growth and accelerate that growth, we want to make sure we optimize our footprint to support that growth. So that's kind of a key area for us as well, Brett. So in a nutshell, we're pleased with where we're at in the direction. We're not where we want to be, but we're going to get there with primarily around those couple of key levers I just talked to you about.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then just switching gears. New business backlog, it seems like as we kind of look into the fall, and I know you haven't calculated the numbers yet, Ken, but it seems like as we look into the fall, production net-net is kind of a tailwind, so it seems like that should be neutral to maybe a positive surprise. I'm kind of wondering. As you look at your bookings throughout the first part of this year, back half of last year, what kind of implications does that suggest for the backlog? It seems like the backlog should be fairly solid as we move into the back half of this year?","James R. Verrier","You're right, Brett. Ken is getting his calculator ready to do the real detailed analysis there over the next few months. But from a booking's perspective and business win perspective, we feel good. What we've seen has been good and strong for us as a company, certainly over the last 6 months. So that gives us a good comfort as we start to build the backlog. What we've seen roll off this year, Brett, has been pretty much what we'd expected, so that's a good encouraging sign. And as we look to the second half of this year, we're seeing the backlog assumptions and projections that we'd factored in seems to pretty much be playing out as we'd thought. So more and more to come, as you know, Brett, but we're feeling pretty good about where we're heading on the backlog.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","If I can just ask on the top line. You highlighted 2 areas of weakness in EU and North America. Can you just talk about what the near-term outlook is like, especially in Europe? Do you think that your relative customer or your exposed customer performance normalizes versus the industry in the third quarter? And also in North America, given that you have a pretty high level of visibility into the out years, when do you think that inflection and demand for your high-tech products comes in?","James R. Verrier","Yes, Ravi. From a European point of view, the key point I'd point out is, things are playing out pretty much as we'd anticipated. I think this is all pretty much what we projected and what we thought would happen. And I think one of the things that we've talked about frequently is you will get quarterly variations in our growth versus the market, and this is probably a good example, where there can be some specific platform of vehicle mix that can work for you or against you, and this is a good example of that. But the fundamentals of our growth and our performance in Europe are still very much intact, and we're not concerned at all there. We're going to continue to see good adoptions of our technology for fuel economy and emissions, and we feel good there. Switching to North America, we talked to in the past about the adoption rates, and you saw pretty good evidence of that in the backlog that came out last year. We moved up the North American and the content in some aspects for the backlog. So when you look at turbocharger penetration as an example into North America, there's tremendous momentum around that, as just one example. So you're going to see that, and I don't think it's a single point inflection, Ravi. I think it's going to be a gradual evolution over a 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-year period. But we're seeing the trend going that way for sure.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. So if I can just follow up on that. Do you expect that there will be outperformance versus the industry in the next couple of quarters or do you think it's a little more gradual?","James R. Verrier","Yes. I think it's going to play out pretty much as we'd expected, which -- we've talked about a reasonable level of outperformance in Europe for the year and it will vary quarter-to-quarter. But nothing really changing from where we were a quarter ago, Ravi.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Understood. And then just finally, if I can follow up on the margin commentary earlier in the Q&A. We [ph] an almost 13% margin this quarter with Europe still very weak. Where do you think your margins can eventually get there? I don't want to use the term peak margins. But as you really start delivering on this secular opportunity, where do you think that finally heads out?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Ravi, I'll tell you that we know that we can probably achieve higher margins in -- I'd rather not give any numbers at this point, but we're comfortable that margins can still expand.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Leiker with Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","This is Joe on the line for David. Just regarding the control of expenses this quarter. In the past, I think you flexed SG&A up or down in the quarter depending on whether trends are better or worse. Just wondering if you did it this quarter and then what your plan for investment might be entering the second half?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","SG&A was pretty much in line with last year, right, basically at this point. What I would say forward-looking, James mentioned this, that we do anticipate R&D spending probably -- if you take a look at our data so far, our guidance really was 3.7% of sales. We're trending a tad higher, maybe 20 basis points higher in that year-to-date. We fully expect that, that trend will continue to trend higher. So that's why earlier in the call, we're talking about the second half margin. That's impacting the second half margins. But other than R&D spending, I think the SG&A controls remains where it's at. I think the only valuation was going to come through the R&D spending.","Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Great. I wanted to touch on the DCT launch in China. First of all, congrats because I think this is 4 years or so in the making. Just wondering, what is the size of the opportunity today if relative to when you first announced these programs? And then do you have a sense of what maybe the launch schedule is? What's the other programs do you have in the backlog on China DCT?","James R. Verrier","Yes, we're really pleased as well, Joe, to get the product launched, and it's a great breakthrough for us and our customers in the Chinese market. So it's great news. We always said that we would launch with SAIC in the middle of this year, which we'd now confirm. And then we will start to follow on from that with FIW with subsequent transmission programs next year and then into 2015. And thus far, the projections around the size of the business and the scope of the business, it's pretty consistent with what we've outlined in the prior calls, Joe, and it's meaningful and very positive for us.","Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then my last one. It's great to see the dividend come back. Just looking at the payout ratio here, would you -- I guess, think this is consistent going forward so that as your earnings grow, we can expected the dividend payment to grow?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Yes. We expect to stay in that yield range that you're seeing right now, Joe.","Operator","Your next question comes from Itay Michaeli with Citi.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So I wanted to go back to the margin topic. You're doing a great job this year of controlling expenses. I'm just wondering how much of these controls are sustainable into next year as your revenue starts to return to the historical growth rate next year with backlog. Are some of these cost controls potentially going to become a headwind next year? Or can we think about incremental margins in 2014 to be pretty similar to how you've identified the walk previously?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Itay, that's a good question. We target 20% incremental margins on our additional sales. And we're very close to the reason why we target that, it talks [ph] about all the negatives of economic headwinds that we get. But we expect that putting back infrastructure and SG&A and some of the things that we're controlling this year probably will result in us not achieving the incremental margins we've seen historically. Now regionally, it could be some issues. Maybe if the sales growth comes out of one region better than another, we'll see better incremental margins. But I would suspect and we're planning on incremental margins not being as robust as we start to put more infrastructure in.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Absolutely. And the drive-through initiatives, will those start to hit your numbers next year or is that more of a sort of a 2, 3-year program?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","I would say it's more of a 2-year. We think it's a 2-year program on the Drivetrain side.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And then just lastly, it does look like CapEx is running a little bit below your prior full year guidance. Anything going on that you still feel comfortable with the prior range for CapEx?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","At this point, we're comfortable with the guidance. We know we have some projects in the back half of for the year, major projects coming on board. So at this point, we're comfortable where the guidance is.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America.","John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","John Lovallo on for John Murphy. First question would be on the all-wheel drive systems. I would imagine that some of the strength in North America was driven by truck mix. But what was the main driver in Korea?","Ken Lamb","John, this is Ken Lamb. So we experienced growth in both automatic transmission components, the traditional ones, and also all-wheel drive. So it was kind of the whole Drivetrain Group was strong in Korea, which is a trend. We've actually seen that for the last couple of quarters.","John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, okay. That's helpful. And then if we can just touch on the dividend for a second. I mean, reinstating the dividend is clearly positive in our opinion. But I guess, I'm curious on what drove the decision internally to do so. And there's no implications, I would imagine, that you see a less robust acquisition landscape or any pullback in growth initiatives or anything in that regard.","James R. Verrier","Yes, I would -- So this pretty -- the way I view it is some of the execution of what we maybe talked about over the last several months, we want to go forward with a balanced approach to the deployment of cash. So in addition to our capital expenditure, the dividend we view as a key piece to that. It is not in any way an indication of a slowdown around M&A enthusiasm or desire from a BorgWarner point of view. We remain where M&A is our top priority for utilization of cash, and we continue to work very, very diligently around M&A opportunity. We just see it as a complementary piece to the whole strategy of cash deployment in addition to the share buybacks. So we think this is very good in terms of balancing our approach, and that's really what it is. It's execution of that strategy that we've talked about in prior quarters. So yes, we feel good about it, and we'll continue to march forward on M&A as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Spak with RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to get back to, I guess, the lack of historical upfront in Europe, for 1 more second. If I recall correctly, some of that -- some of your mix negatively started to impact you in the back half of last year. So should we begin to see some better results just on some of your comps? And then the second part of that would be, I believe you in the past stated that more of your backlog is second half weighted. So should that help with some of the potential outperformance in the back half as well?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Yes, Joe, this is Ron. Let's talk about the second quarter comp year-over-year. If you go back to last year -- I was going to point this out earlier -- we had in the Drivetrain segment itself, we had sales increase of 20%, which was substantially above the market. And if you go back to that call and you analyze why, how we got there, we got there by DCT primarily in Europe. So the year-over-year comp in Europe is difficult, which I point out in my call this year when you're comparing the 20% sales growth last year. So that was one element. And then also as last year unfolded, like you pointed out, we had a more northern European OEM mix that was in our favor and that started going more to a normal mix, I would say, but was more unfavorable to us as it rolled up throughout the year. And as we entered the year, we felt we are in a more stable mix between Northern and Southern European OEMs. Now as we go forward, your question is what's the year-over-year comp? That's -- we're trying to still analyze all that. But I mean mathematically, you would say that should improve because you're now to a more normal mix that went unfavorable in the third quarter. I mean that's a logical conclusion that you're kind of drawing to, right there.","Ken Lamb","And let me answer your question about the backlog being started in the second half and if that can help us. We certainly expect the backlog to be started in the second half. However, we do have an offset from just less production available. So our base business will be less because of Christmas and the summer shutdowns. And that will partially offset the backlog, which will be started in the second half.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And one more quick one -- I get the earlier comment. It's great to see DCT China finally get off the ground. Is it possible to quantify, and maybe just from a margin drag perspective, what the lack of top line revenue has been given that you've obviously laid out all the costs and there's nothing to absorb that?","James R. Verrier","Yes. I'd say -- the only thing I'd say, Joe, is which we described in prior discussions, the slower ramp, the slower ramp of DCT in general is just being the customer is getting ready with that technology. Not really a BorgWarner issue, although we work very, very closely with our customers. I think you know it's a challenging technology. It's really been around getting the product ready for market. We're not seeing any slowdown in market desire or market want for the products, so we feel comfortable with the long-term view. It's more of a product quality product technology, readiness issue with the OEMs. And I think this is a good indication that we're starting to move forward now, which is great.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. But I mean, it hasn't -- the lack of absorption has clearly been part of the issue in the Drivetrain Group. Is that not accurate?","James R. Verrier","Yes, yes.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","That is accurate. We said that before that the DCT in China has been a drag on the Drivetrain margins.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And so it sounds like over the next 2 years, you think you'll start to get some absorption and that will help with the DCT improvement -- the Drivetrain improvement?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Yes. Okay. Yes, that okay.","James R. Verrier","Yes, you're right, Joe.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's actually Pat Nolan on for Rod. Most of my questions have been answered, so I just had one just a follow-up detail question and then one bigger picture question. Just a detail question. The corporate expense, is there a difference between your segment results and the total operating income? It looks like the corporate expense actually declined a bit sequentially. How should we think about how that corporate expense ranges for the rest of the year? Is the Q1 kind of more indicative of what we'll see in the back half or should it kind of average out in first 2 quarters?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Okay. First of all, I just want to confirm that's correct. Sequentially we're down about $7 million on the corporate expense. Now when you look at the segment, you've got to take into consideration their affiliate income is also included in there. And in fact, that was improved sequentially, reduces the expenses. You want to call that out. That's a little minor thing you have to take into consideration. To answer your question is, what I would say on the corporate expenses is that the quarter itself probably was slightly below an average, maybe $3 million to $4 million below the average that you would expect going forward, okay?","Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's helpful. And on the buyback pace, can you talk about what the drivers are? I know you're not factoring in any prospective buybacks from where we are today into the guidance. But what are the drivers that would move the pace of buybacks from where it was in the first half as we look to the back half? I mean, are there acquisitions that are pretty close to the finish line that maybe the cash will go towards that in the back half? Or conversely, if operations came in better, would you be willing to pick up that pace?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","I think there's many factors we look at, at the pace of buybacks, everything from acquisitions like you're referring to, market conditions, multiples, where we're at and certain historical things, valuations internally. I wouldn't say there's one factor, but you're generally correct. Cash flow regionally also could impact that. I don't really look at one item when we make decisions on buybacks. So you can't really point to one item.","Operator","Your next question comes from Colin Langan with UBS.","Rahul Chadha - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","This is Rahul Chadha on behalf of Colin. Just looking at your second quarter revenues and the updated guidance for the full year. Second quarter was slightly below where the consensus was estimating it to be. And it doesn't seem like you're changing your production assumptions for any region for the full year. What gives you the confidence to tighten the guidance range? Is it the commercial vehicle better than expected or better visibility?","James R. Verrier","I think at a fairly simplistic level, our view from a market outlook and a production volume level is consistent with where we were a quarter ago. So nothing from our view in the market has changed significantly enough to impact. What's driving the guidance on the revenue side, the tightening of it, is just we've got 6 months behind us. So we've got -- the first half of the year is done and in the back, so that just gives us incremental confidence that we can narrow the range. And on the EPS side, it's really 2 key things. It's the strong performance that we delivered thus far in the year, and as Ron explained, around the share count issue. And if you put all of that together, that's why we feel comfortable where we're at.","Rahul Chadha - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That's helpful. And then what's your outlook for the diesel mix in Europe for this year? And how do you expect this to trend maybe over the next few years?","James R. Verrier","Yes. We are -- our projection is around 53% in Europe of diesel rates, which is pretty much in line with where we were in prior quarters. So we're not seeing any real shifting in diesel mix in Europe. So that's kind of the quick answer for you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Sponheimer with Gabelli.","Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Most of my questions have been answered here. But a longer-term question, I guess, around emissions regulations in Europe. As we head into the next year, give an idea about what incremental content you may be able to put on a commercial vehicle in 2014 in Europe relative to this year.","Ken Lamb","Brian, this is Ken. As these emissions regulations continue to tighten, it's incrementally positive for us kind of across our portfolio. There's not one specific thing that we can say is going to be additional compared to the content on our previous emissions reg level. But just across the board, generally speaking, our technology helps. As they continue to progress in the emissions reg, there'll just be more [indiscernible] on content in general.","Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay. And as far as your European operations are concerned, particularly within the engine division, where are you on a capacity utilization basis, say, relative to 1.5 years, 2 years ago?","James R. Verrier","I'd focus a little more kind of where I am now as opposed to honestly where I was a couple of years ago. But right now, we're pretty, pretty healthy. I mean, we're -- I don't want to put an exact number on it, but I would say we're in the 80-ish percent type range of utilization. The reason I put a little bit of a vagueness in there is it does vary a little bit plant to plant and product to product because they're serving different customers that might be on an accelerated growth or they might be launching products. But in the average, we're probably in the 80-ish, 85% range, and it's pretty healthy.","Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","And just directionally on Drivetrain, it's slightly lower?","James R. Verrier","I'd say Drivetrain is pretty similar to Engine in terms of utilization in Europe. There's not a big distinction. Then again, with the Drivetrain Group, the same comment really -- it really does vary a little bit plant to plant. But at a macro level for both the segments and the company, we're in a 80-ish percent, 85% range.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I've got 2 questions, housekeeping and strategic. Housekeeping, great margins. Are there any engineering recovery timings that we ought to be aware of as we kind of think sequentially about the margins?","James R. Verrier","Nothing significant, Brian, okay?","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Second question is more strategic. We've seen some new entrants into the commercial truck transmission space, pushing dual-clutch transmission. I visited VX booth [ph] down in Louisville earlier this year. You're already fairly active in the turbocharger business in CV. Is this an adjacency that you might be looking at?","James R. Verrier","Yes, Brian, this is James. The quick answer is yes. You mentioned -- turbo is a good example. Obviously, we're already in that space as we are with our thermal product offering. And as opportunities present themselves for us to apply Drivetrain technology or engine timing technology, we are looking actively to do this. And we continue to have those discussions with the commercial vehicle guys, leveraging our current relationships that we already have on the turbo and the thermal and the EGR side of our business.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Fair to say there's not much of that in the backlog yet?","James R. Verrier","That's probably a good assumption, Brian.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And is this something you do organically or could a bolt-on acquisition help?","James R. Verrier","It will depend a little bit on the exact products. But I would say our primary driver is to utilize the existing technology portfolio with maybe some modifications or enhancements or adjustments. That's our primary path. But I would say if there's an acquisition out there that's complementary to help us accelerate with technology into the CV space, that remains attractive to us as a possibility.","Operator","We have time for one final question, and that question comes from Richard Hilgert with Morningstar.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Ron, earlier in your comments, you had talked about the light vehicle segments, Asia, Europe, North America and Asia. Europe, 10% versus 3% production there and so on. And then you said that the North American number, the 3% increase versus the 5% increase in production was acceptance of advanced powertrain lagging the other markets. I'm curious, you're starting to quote business now 3 years out. Are you starting to see some of that starting to show up now in the North American business in what you're quoting?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Richard, in our backlog presentation, there is a section in there that we actually talk about North America now starting to adopt more of the advanced powertrains. So to answer to your question, our backlog is starting to reflect that. When we issue a new backlog, we'll have to update it for you. But we have started seeing that increase in our backlog.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. Do you have a mix on your turbocharger business between diesel and gasoline engine?","Ken Lamb","We do, and it's largely reflective of the market overall. Every diesel engine just about has a turbocharger on it. So more of our business is weighted that way today. However, as you look at our growth going forward, a lot of that is on the gasoline side. More of it is on the gasoline side.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","But we can expect -- you said it more or less reflects the market itself percentage breakdown between Turbo or between diesel and gasoline, yes?","Ken Lamb","It's not direct. There wasn't a direct numerical comment. It was in general, there are more diesel turbochargers in the world today than gasoline. So our business also reflects that, too.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. One final housekeeping item in the guidance that you'd previously given. Operating cash flow was $900 million to $1 billion. And is that gone up now with the change in your margin?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","No, it has not. That's a wide range, as you know, and there's many factors that influence that, including CapEx spending and working capital adjustments. So I'm still within that range, Richard.","Ken Lamb","I'd like to thank you all again for joining us. We expect to file our 10-Q before the end of the day, which will provide details of our results.

I'd like to start by sharing a few thoughts on 2018 on slide 6. 2018 was the year of strong execution for BorgWarner. Despite the industry volatility, we delivered more than 600 basis points of our growth. This is an amazing performance. We had significant launches and wins across combustion, hybrid and electric vehicles.","Specifically, wins in hybrid and electric included multiple P2 programs, including three complete module awards, multiple high-voltage coolant heater awards for battery electric vehicles and continued electric motor and electric drive module bookings.","At our Investor Day, we shared a 2023 revenue outlook of $14 billion before any M&A and a free cash flow outlook of $1 billion. As you will see later, our backlog supports the necessary outgrowth to reach these goals. We continue to approach our customers as a balanced propulsion partner. Looking at the win flows, we expect to be overweight in hybrid and electric by 2023.","Turning to the industry on slide 7, and starting with Q4, the global light vehicle production came down about 3% versus our expectation of about 1% decline going into the quarter. So this was a 200 basis point headwind versus our expectation. However, I'm very proud to say that our outgrowth in Q4 was slightly stronger than what we expected, which allowed us to achieve our growth guidance.","The biggest impact to industry volume expectation were, once again, Europe and China. European light vehicle production was down 6% year-over-year as our customers continued to work through WLTP certification. China light vehicle production was down 15% year-over-year and nearly 20% in December.","Now for 2019, we expect that the challenging conditions in China and Europe will continue into 2019. In Europe, we still expect first half industrial volume to decline as customers work through the final WLTP impacts. In China, we expect double-digit industry declines in Q1 as customers reduce inventory. As a result, this is also impacting the launch of some of our backlog.","As we look to the full year, we expect a market decline in the minus 2% to minus 5% range. At the midpoint of our guide, we're factoring in China down 10%, Europe down 3% and North America down 2%. But the key is that we expect to continue to outgrow the market in 2019 based on continued strong demand for our product.","Let me now move to Slide 8. First, a brief summary of the Q4 results. Overall, we're very pleased with the way the teams reacted to the weaker industry backdrop. With $2.6 billion in sales, we are up 2% organically. This compares to our market being down approximately 3%. So our outgrowth was very strong in the quarter at approximately 500 basis points.","Looking at our regional light vehicle growth, our North America revenue grew high-single digits. We saw a low-single digit revenue decline in China or more than 10% better than the industrial decline. Europe, revenue declined low-single digits. This light vehicle growth was supplemented by positive revenue trends in commercial vehicle and off-road.","We reached our goal of a double-digit incremental margin despite the industry volume volatility. Our earnings per share is at $1.21 and was above our guidance range due to a year and tax true-up.","Now for the full-year 2019, we expect revenue to be down 2.5% to up 2% organically. This represents an outgrowth of 250 basis points to 400 basis points over our expected market decline. Excluding the first quarter, which is being impacted by launch timing and customer inventory adjustments, our outgrowth is expected to be 400 basis points to 550 basis points above market.","We expect our earnings per share to be at $4.00 to $4.35 with a wider than typical range reflecting the end market uncertainty. While we continue to deliver strong outgrowth in 2019, we will also look at ways to adjust our cost structure to adapt to the current environment without compromising our longer-term aspirations.","Now let's look at this exciting longer-term view for BorgWarner with a snapshot of our outdated backlog. Starting on slide 10, from a product perspective, we see growth across the portfolio, 20% of our backlog will be related to vehicles with combustion propulsion systems, 70% of our backlog will be related to hybrid, and 10% of our backlog will be related to battery electric vehicles. So 80% of our backlog is from the hybrid and electric. This is a great example on how we are executing our proportional growth strategy with overweight hybrid and electric.","Turning to Slide 11. From a regional perspective, we see outgrowth in all our major markets; 25% of the backlog is in the Americas, 15% is in Europe as continued diesel declines impact the net new business backlog, 60% of the backlog is in Asia.","Within this, China accounts for 50%. China is where the music is being played for hybrids and electrics, and we're doing very, very well there. This is playing an increased factor in our growth. From a customer perspective, our very diverse customer base is increasingly important. This gives us great insight to what's happening across the entire propulsion landscape.","Wrapping up on slide 12, our '19 to '21 backlog is expected to be within the range of $2 billion to $2.4 billion. You'll notice that the 2019 backlog is down from last year's disclosure due to [indiscernible] industry volumes and launch timing impact in 2019. However, you notice strong backlog for 2020 and 2021. Importantly, this backlog will support an average outgrowth of 500 basis points to 600 basis points for the next three years, and keep us on track to reach $14 billion of revenue by 2023. These targets are achievable because electrification accelerates the opportunities for BorgWarner.","With that, I will hand it over to Tom.","Thomas McGill","Thank you, Fred. Good morning everyone.","Before I review the financial details, I'd like to provide some of the highlights as I see them for the fourth quarter. First, our outgrowth remains strong at 500 basis points. This allowed us to deliver our guidance despite end markets that continue to weaken throughout Q4.","Second, incremental margin performance was in line with our expectations due to strong performance in our Drivetrain segment and corporate cost controls. And finally free cash flow generation was better than expected due to lower working capital and capital spending requirements.","So let's turn to Slide 14. On a comparable basis, our organic sales were up 2%. This is solid performance compared to our weighted average light vehicle industry production for the quarter, which was down approximately 3% year-over-year. We saw a 3% decline in China against the production market that was down more than 15%. Europe revenue was down 2% compared to the 6% industry production decline in the quarter. North America revenue was up high-single digit versus the 2% production growth in the quarter. Commercial vehicle was a benefit contributing about 50 basis points to our growth.","Now let's look at the year-over-year comparison for operating income which can be found on slide 15. Q4 adjusted operating profit was $323 million compared to $327 million in Q4 '17. Our operating margin of 12.6% was flat year-over-year. On a comparable basis, operating income was up $6 million on $52 million of higher sales. That gives us an incremental margin of 11% in the quarter which was in line with our double-digit goal going into the quarter.","However, this is below our long-term mid teens target due to the rapid decline in industry volume and tariff-related cost inflation. Earnings per share on a reported basis were $1.10 per diluted share and on an adjusted basis net earnings were a $1.21 per diluted share.","So, now let's take a closer look at our operating segments in the quarter, beginning on slide 16 of the deck. Reported Engine segment net sales were $1.54 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the Engine segment on a comparable basis was 0.4% as growth in North America was offset by lower Europe and China volumes.","Adjusted EBIT was $243 million for the Engine segment or 15.7% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Engine segment's adjusted EBIT was down to $16 million and $6 million of higher sales. This weak incremental margin performance was driven by the rapid decline in industry volumes. We are not satisfied by this performance and are exploring additional cost actions within the Engine segment.","Now turning to Slide 17; the Drivetrain segment net sales were $1.05 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the Drivetrain segment on a comparable basis was 4.4%, primarily due to strong DCT growth in China, as well as transmission components in all-wheel drive growth in North America. Growth was partially mitigated by lower volumes on European customers with higher than average drivetrain content.","Adjusted EBIT was $131 million for the Drivetrain segment, or 12.5% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Drivetrain segment's adjusted EBIT was up $9 million and $45 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 20%. The strong performance was driven by the benefit of new programs.","Before I move on to our guidance, I would like to discuss our cash performance for Q4. Our annual free cash flow came in at $580 million and that's ahead of about $550 million to $575 million guidance and our expectations going into Q4. There are two factors driving the strong performance.","Number one is that the working capital pressures that we expected in Q4 were not as bad as we originally feared. And number two, was due to the push-out of some of our new programs from first half '19 to second half '19, some of our planned Q4 capital spending was delayed into 2019.","Now I'd like to discuss our 2019 full-year guidance. So turning to sales growth guidance for the full year on slide 19, our guidance is based on a market assumption of down 2% to 5%. We expect our organic revenue change of negative 2.5% to positive 2% or 250 basis points to 400 basis points of outgrowth. The thermostat divestiture is expected to reduce sales by approximately $98 million in 2019. Currency is expected to be at $280 million headwind. So total revenue is expected to be in the range of $9.9 billion to $10.37 billion.","Our operating income walk is on slide 20. Our consolidated operating income margin is expected to be flat to down in 2019. This margin performance is due to the relatively low organic growth combined with costs related to tariffs, supplier bankruptcy costs in Europe and changes to launch timing throughout 2019.","To finish up our full-year guidance, please turn to Slide 21. Our EPS guidance range is in the $4.00 per dilute share to $4.35 per diluted share range. Our guidance range is wider than typical. We're targeting a free cash flow of $550 million to $600 million. The midpoint of this guidance implies flat free cash flow year-over-year as higher CapEx spending is expected to be offset by lower working capital usage. The tax rate for 2019 is expected to be approximately 26%.","On Slide 23 is our first quarter guidance. First, sales. We expect an organic sales decline of 5.5% to 7.5%, and this is roughly in line with our market forecast as our outgrowth is impacted by the timing of launches in 2019 and customer inventories of programs launched during 2018. Our earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.92 per share to $0.96 per share and this guidance is based on a 26% tax rate and incorporates a $130 million FX revenue headwind year-over-year.","So in conclusion, let me summarize our Q4 and our outlook. Our overall execution was solid in light of the challenging industry volume. Our organic sales growth was 2.0% or 500 basis points of outgrowth. The Q4 incremental margin of 11% was in line with our expectations driven by strong performance in our Drivetrain segment and corporate cost controls.","As we look into 2019, the environment will remain challenging. However, we are continuing to outgrow the industry and we'll take the necessary steps to adjust our costs to the changing industry volume outlook.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat.","Patrick Nolan","Thank you Tom. Sharon, we're ready to open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank.","Emmanuel Rosner","First question on - are on the first quarter's - the first quarter factors and can you maybe highlight what your production assumptions are maybe by market or for the first quarter? And then just maybe a little bit more color around how some of these factors impact your backlog. It looks like you're - I mean you are essentially saying you want to really outperform the underlying markets in Q1. So I assume there's minimal amount of backlog. And so how do these new production and dynamics around the various market impact the backlog in Q1?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","So if you all focus on Q1, it's essentially Europe and China. And in China, we think that the run rate in Q1 is not going to be much better than the run rate we saw in December. So it's you know - it's below minus 20%. And in Europe - also we see Europe around minus 5%, minus 6% which also is pretty much the run rate that we saw in Q4 last year. Now when it comes to the backlog, it impacts the backlog where actually - literally there is no backlog in Q1.","If you look at the backlog evolution and if you are removing Q1, we're pretty much absolutely in line with what we've announced and marching towards this $2 billion to $2.4 billion. And the outgrowth of the market actually, if you take Q1 out, if you do the math on outgrowth of the market in Q2 to Q4, we are around 400 basis points to 550 basis points, which supports our long-term view of $14 billion by 2023.","Emmanuel Rosner","No, I really saw that and that's helpful color. I'm just - curious on the ground, how does that actually sort of translate in the first quarter, because obviously the whole beauty of the backlog is, it is growth above market. So the markets are extremely weak in Q1 and that's a - I think it's a fair conservative assumption. I'm just curious what it is that's on the ground in your plans that drives the lack of backlog in the first quarter?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","Well, it's essentially the China volume of new programs that are - that are lower right. And it's because of - of the market being down so much. Also we have and I think we talked about it before, some Europe and North America timing, but the majority of the impact is in China.","Emmanuel Rosner","And I guess my second question then is, you mentioned maybe three margin drivers for the 2019 guidance. The - obviously, I understand the low organic gross piece of it, but then you also mentioned tariffs, supplier bankruptcies and then changes in the launch timing. Can you maybe give a little more color on each of these - on each of these buckets and any numbers you are able to share?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","So from a - from a full-year basis at the high end of our guide, we have an incremental of single digit. I think it's around 6% and that's essentially linked to the weaker Q1. At the low end of our guide, we have - have a decremental. that is, a little bit on the high side and it's also linked in Q1 from - a volume and conversion standpoint. Supplier bankruptcy is around $5 million, if I had to show a number. And as you know, tariff is also impacting us. And on the announced perspective we're not - we're not slowing down on any R&D announced support and that has an impact of about $10 million.","Emmanuel Rosner","And the tariffs?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","The tariff impact is about $20 million, mostly in first half.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph Spak","I just wanted to maybe follow along some of that and, Fred, some of your comments because if you look at the implied guidance beyond the first quarter on a total revenue basis, it looks like you're flat year-over-year, but then the outgrowth is like 4%, which I think is the number you said. So I know that's sort of just in the math, so I was wondering if you can provide a little bit more texture to the cadence because it would seem like what you're basically saying is still some issues in the second quarter and then maybe a little bit stronger outgrowth in the back half. Is that fair?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","The outgrowth, if you remove Q1 with inventory adjustment in China, launch timing is actually improving quarter-over-quarter. And the back half of 2019, the outgrowth is close to 500 basis points, which was - which is in line with the outgrowth of last year, and which is in line with the backlog and in line with the $14 billion by 2023. So that's the cadence and that's the sequence of that backlog and outgrowth of the market.","Joseph Spak","And then on the backlog, I was wondering if you could just give a little bit more - you mentioned the China number and that's where all the action is, and it's actually a big percentage of the backlog. Can you talk a little bit more about the type of business you're running there, who you're running it with? And then also, maybe just if you care to add, like how much of the backlog is turbochargers and maybe even how much of that is turbos for hybrid vehicles?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","All right. So let me give you some color on the backlog. About 15% of the backlog is related to turbos, about 30% of the backlog is related to transmission products including DCT and including hybrid products, 20% of the backlog is all-wheel drive and 15% of the backlog is around rotating electric components and motors. In China, most of our backlog is advanced hybrids battery electric vehicle. But we also grow in some of our combustion products. So I would say it's pretty much across the board, 80% of the backlog being hybrid and electric, and I think this is a great example on how we execute the strategy of being overweight in hybrid and electric by 2023.","Joseph Spak","And then within China, is it domestic? Is it the global OEs? Any color there?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","So it's about 50\/50. We are 50% working with the Chinese, the big ones and we're doing well with them and the other 50% are with the western JVs.","Operator","Your next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer.","Noah Kaye","And actually just to follow up on Joe's question, it's really around the methodology and assumptions that you're making to derisk that three-year backlog number. You know I think we have a sense that the number of new energy vehicle car makers there is unsustainable. So what should investors know about your methodology and your conviction level in this three-year backlog number?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","So Noah, we incorporate risk factors and we put in a lot of intelligence in volume adjustments. And we've done that since a few years. There is no change in what we do. We are taking all that in account when we look at the three-year backlog.","Noah Kaye","And then maybe switching gears, how should we think about priorities for cash at '19? You kept your dividend unchanged. You know in 4Q, could you get more aggressive on share buybacks considering what stock is versus this prior Q? And then do you have any active conversations around the M&A pipeline that might materialize?","Thomas McGill","Noah, this is Tom. So first of all, with dividends we've said before that we will grow dividends with our free cash flow growth. So we were kept on a level this year. On the stock buyback, we're guiding to share repurchases of about $100 million versus about $150 million in 2018.","Our 2019 guidance is similar to how we initiated 2018 as well. However, we're going to continue to buy back shares opportunistically as has been our historical practice when we're producing excess cash. And if there's no near-term M&A possibilities, we will consider buying back additional shares. So, with that - and then we - again, we do continue to look at M&A with a focus on technology.","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","And I could give you some color on this. Technology is really what's driving our approach, and technology is what drives our focus and our decisions. So we continue to be opportunistic and very, very disciplined the way we look at M&A. And you know it's always been the focus, will always be a focus, always very technology-driven.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.","David Tamberrino","Good morning, gentlemen. I just wanted to ask you about your regional production guidance, because just looking at the different suppliers and kind of forecasts that are out there, I think you have the most conservative that we've seen so far. So just curious if this is more a reflection of what you're seeing from your customers or really just your beliefs in the market, given it is a little bit lower than I think everybody else is baking in for their numbers","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","You know I think it's early in the year. We feel that you know, we need to be a little bit prudent in the market assumptions. From what we see, we see Q1 with inventory adjustment and some volume delays. So what we are focusing on is focusing on what we can control and focusing on our strategy to outgrow the market around 500 basis points year-over-year.","You can have some plus, some years or quarter, we're going north of that like we did last year. Some years or quarter we're going to be a little bit lower than that like Q1 this year. But that's our focus and - I think it's the right thing to do, to be prudent looking at the volatility of all those market dynamics right now.","David Tamberrino","So it's not necessarily anything you're seeing from a specific program. It's more just where we've left 2018. That's the best place to start given the chop?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","I think - yeah, I would agree with that.","David Tamberrino","And then my follow-up is Bosch recently bought out their partner Daimler's stake in this electric EM-motive JV that they used to have. Does - that competitor taking full control of an E-motors business, is that going to create more of a competitive market? You know on the back of this maybe, what are you seeing in terms of competition for, you know some of those complete module awards that you've been getting and you've been winning? Thank you.","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","We're very, very happy with the motor that we have. We have a great motor. We have a great technology with a PACE Award. We're very happy with the booking flow that we see. And as we mentioned before, we don't see any differences from a competition intensity in this field than what we see in other fields in other product lines.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research.","Rod Lache","I had some - I was hoping you can just clarify some things for us on the backlog. If I looked at the midpoint of your backlog breakdown from last year, hybrid was $919 million. And now it's a $1.05 billion over that. Actually a little bit, it looks like a $550 million increase. Combustion went from $1 billion down to $440 million. And then if I look at the regional breakdown, China has actually increased from $660 million to $1.01 billion.","It looks like North America - the Americas and Europe are down. So is the way that we should interpret this is that basically what you're winning is overwhelmingly in China and hybrid? And you're not winning as much in the Western markets? And if that's the case, why are there not that many awards in the Western markets? What does the pipeline look like? And what's been happening in these markets?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","So two things I would say Rod. First one is, we strongly believe that China is where the music is played from a battery electric vehicle standpoint and we're doing very well here - there. And we're very proud about having 50% of our backlog being in China. In Europe, when you look at the backlog you need to - I think factor that effect that it's made of the diesel decline. And if you factor that back in, I think you will increase that European backlog by about 10%.","And in North America, even if customers are moving, I think customers are waiting on regulations that we hope are going to become published and real in the next weeks or months. So that's what I would say to give you some color on your question.","Rod Lache","So it's not so much that you've missed out or lost share. It's just that those contracts haven't been awarded. Can you give us any color on what the pipeline looks like as you look forward? And then just lastly, obviously there's been a lot of volatility in China production and some - from time to time you have some of those customers push out launches? With that in mind, can you just give us a feel for how you might have incorporated some conservatism in the China assumptions for backlog?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","So we don't see program cancellations. We see some delays and we see volumes of the backlog being impacted by the fact that the Chinese market is lower and inventories are being are being managed. I would say that what I see is that the backlog is well balanced across the three regions. When I look at the intensity of what people are doing from a hybrid and electric standpoint, and we're very confident that the booking that we see coming our way is supporting a constant 500 basis points outgrowth and confirming that $14 billion by 2023.","Rod Lache","So just to clarify Fred, going forward is the opportunity set accelerating in Europe or is it still that most of the activity, not just hybrid, but just in general, net new business opportunity? So obviously it's hard for us to see what's been happening net of the diesel decline.","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","I would say China is still a significant portion of the backlog. China is remaining significant and Europe is going to come. The good thing and what we really like where we are is that, from a from a hybrid and electric standpoint, we're going to get scale in China. And getting scale is what's important once we are - we're at scale. It's going to be really, really an enabler for us to be booking business in Europe and in North America.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John Murphy","I just want to follow on Rod's question, because I think it's probably one of most important things we learned today here in these backlog shifts. When you look at the extreme shifts that Rod highlighted, I mean how much of that is being driven by program wins and maybe delays and is there any component of it that's based on changes in volume assumptions, and how - means, how confident are you with these numbers, obviously things can shift around?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","So as I mentioned, we are incorporating a certain level of risk and volume adjustments in the backlog. And we are used to - since we talk to everyone and since we have a very broad customer base, we used to discount what customers tell us and - but we feel good about where we are. The backlog to 2021 is 100% booked, and 2023 is about 80% booked. So the biggest risk that you would have between now and 2021 would be industry volume.","John Murphy","Fred, maybe just a follow up. I mean the preponderance of the shift is a result of programs, not industry or program volume assumption. I mean this is really a shift in program wins for you, is that correct?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","I would say that there is a timing effect in 2018. If you didn't have Q1 the way we look at it, you would see a backlog that would be absolutely in line with what we've announced last year, which was around $700 million to $800 million. So if you remove Q1, the 2019 backlog would be flat versus the prior announcement.","Nevertheless or in addition, I would say that, what's important for us is to really focus on what we can control which is the outgrowth of the market and which is launching the products and booking the new businesses. So, if you remove that timing effect of Q1, we're actually absolutely in-line with what we've announced before.","John Murphy","I apologize Fred. I might be asking the question incorrectly - is that a fair statement?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","I think it is a fair statement. We see an acceleration in the flow of products that we win in hybrid and also you need to factoring in - factor in the diesel decline that impacts the volume on the production spend, on the combustion segment.","John Murphy","And then just to follow up and lastly, the margins and return implications for these kinds of shifts, I mean as we think about the next three years, and maybe Tom, this is a question for you here, what - will that have a big implication for margins and returns as we see this shift away from combustion towards hybrids and EVs as you have to put maybe more capacity into play? And as Fred alluded, you need to build scale in China so that you can compete back in North American Europe to try to understand the marginal return implications.","Thomas McGill","Right. We don't anticipate any changes in margins and returns when we close business. And this is done on our investor presentation. Yeah, we have certain return on invested capital hurdle and those hurdles are the same no matter the region or the type of product. So yeah - so we have that minimum hurdle rate, we can always go to go above that. But what we're seeing on our business wins and hybrid and electric is kind of an average return on invested capital that's very consistent with what we have on combustion.","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","And then bring our CapEx, we intend to have that. They'll be within that same 5.5% to 6.5% range long term. Again we're hoping to drive that to the lower end of the range, maybe go lower but that factors there in as well.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Colin Langan with UBS.","Colin Langan","Any color on the margin outlook, how we should think about it between the two different segments? It seems like Engine, particularly this quarter, is under a lot of pressure. Should we expect that to continue or accelerate or is there going to be some stabilization there?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","Yes, I'd say a couple of things. One is, and we've talked about this. For us to get our mid-teen incremental goal, we're looking for some minimum amount of growth of at least 2% because that growth will help us drive that incremental margin and we admit that on the Engine side separately, and I talked about it. We're not really happy with the incremental and decremental downtime Engine right now. So we're going to take a closer look at that and see if there's some cost actions that we can take to get that more in line with our long-term expectations.","Colin Langan","And can you - you mentioned earlier the tariff headwind was I think it's the $20 million. Is that an incremental impact of tariff? I thought there was a big hit and already. And then is that assuming a 25% tariff which obviously is not imposed yet, but was Brent?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","The tariff is $20 million incremental in first half.","Colin Langan","And it assumes the 25% rate in there?","Thomas McGill","It's for the tariffs that are currently in place, but we have not made any assumption for any tariffs that have not been decided on. So List 3 has very little impact.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays.","Brian Johnson","Yes. I appreciate your conservative end market guide and not depending on macro to bounce back, but I'm struck by the slowdown in above-market growth the 250 basis point to 400 basis point range versus the strong 4Q and '18 as a whole was over 600 basis points. Could you maybe break down, how much of that is due to just the delay of the Q1 backlog and how much is conservatism around other factors?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","It's almost all around the Q1 backlog. As I mentioned before, if you remove the - no backlog in Q1, we're in line with the 500 basis points at midpoint.","Brian Johnson","And that the backlog, the programs that would have been launched in Q1, why do they just launch later in the year or do they just kind of roll into '19 given everything's pushed out a quarter?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","Yes.","Brian Johnson","I mean, roll into 2020. I'm sorry. One year out.","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","Yes they are - you have some delays announced you have also some lower volume announced, due to the Q1 market situation especially in China. And this is going to roll out in the future years as you as you've seen the 2020 and '21 backlog is strong. Yeah, so it's a timing essentially linked to Q1.","Brian Johnson","And how much of that '20 backlog nearly doubling versus '19 is program delays versus fresh programs?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","I'm not sure, I can give you that granularity at this point in time, Brian.","Brian Johnson","And then final question around the backlog. Could you give us more color on not just the - you've talked about the propulsion mix in the China backlog, but the mix of OEMs between global JVs, the strong local players e.g. Geely, Great Wall and others and then the more regional smaller tier, low - lower tier OEMs who have to catch up on powertrain but also in the most macro impacted regions?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","There was strong - we were strong with that, with the big Chinese OEMs. That's really the punch line, Brian. And we will follow up with you on your prior question. I apologize I cannot give you that granularity. On China, it's the big ones.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo.","Deepa Raghavan","This is Deepa Raghavan for Rich Kwas. A couple of questions from me. A medium term question first. What are some of the production assumptions in the backlog for your 2020, 2021 target particularly in China, but also others too?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","So the industry assumption that we have in 2020 and 2021 is a growth of 1%, which is the baseline assumption that we have that - built up our $14 billion by 2023.","Deepa Raghavan","Is there a split between China versus North American production assumptions?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","I would say that we're incorporating a kind of a slower growth in China that we've seen in the past with maybe a low-single digit growth in that market going forward.","Deepa Raghavan","My second question would be, can you discuss some of the restructuring that you mentioned and if there are any other actions you're undertaking to offset some of the negative volume impact? We heard you on some of the additional actions on the Engine segment, but you know is there going to be more on the Drivetrain too, I mean just given your - you need to offset negative volume impact across your firm? Thank you.","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","We're exploring a lot of different options and we will give you more detail and color in the Q2 call. I mean in the next quarter call.","Operator","Your next question comes from Armintas Sinkevicius with Morgan Stanley.","Armintas Sinkevicius","Thank you for taking the question. Just can you remind us how much diesel headwind are you incorporating? Is it the usual sort of 500 bips of headwind and how we should be thinking about diesel beyond this year?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","We are incorporating a 300 basis points to 400 basis points shift between last year and this year down. And two things that I would add. We see a little bit of a decrease in the slowing down rate in the past few months. And also as far as we are concerned, as you know Armintas that by the end of 2020, we will be totally agnostic to that diesel penetration take rate.","Armintas Sinkevicius","And then, there is some commentary at the Investor Day around M&A. Just curious to get your thoughts - updated thoughts here, particularly given the environment and the environment has - presents any opportunities.","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","Yeah. It has not changed. As I mentioned before, it's all around technology. It's a technology-driven approach. We're focused on M&A, we're focused on building sustained capabilities for complete solutions and technology. Product leadership drives the focus.","Armintas Sinkevicius","And then, my last one here. During the quarter, you announced the launch of, I believe it's the iDM. Have you noticed any change in conversations since the official launch?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","No, we are absolutely not seeing any change. We are seeing a strong pull for our iDM products for battery electric vehicle. We are also seeing a strong pull as you've seen in some of the announcements for our air and liquid heaters. And today, most of what we sell is eDM, so it's transmission and mortar. And in focus and in the near future, we felt iDM which is transmission mortar and power electronics.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with J.P. Morgan.","Ryan Brinkman","Thanks for taking my question, which is really just exploring a little bit more around the push out of some of the backlog from 1Q further in the year. You talked earlier in the call about softness in China and Europe and maybe that's created an oversupply of some of the vehicles that were recently launched in 2018. I think there's more publicly available data that we can look at in Europe. But I was just hoping you could shed a little bit of light on the inventory situation in China. Is it concentrated at certain automakers or in certain product segments? And then if environment persists in being softer as you seem to assume with the outlook for 10% lower OBP there this year, is there any risks.","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","We are planning for China's run rate to be stable to today's run rate. So we're not we're not planning for a deterioration of the China market. We're planning for a - we're not planning for an improvement as the year advances. We are not thinking also we're not seeing any slowdown in intensity of program development and awards that we see from those key customers that we have in China, which is really encouraging.","Ryan Brinkman","That is good to hear. And then I know it's only a small a last question a small minority of your business but I just curious if you could provide us an update on your commercial vehicle business? It seems the trends impact in that market, we're still very strong in the fourth quarter and yet there's sort of some anecdotal signs in the US that there might be some potential slowing. You've got some insight in that market. Just curious what are your thoughts are?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","Yes we benefited in queue far from our - from a strong commercial vehicle market. In our backlog we assumed flat going forward. And again when you think about commercial vehicle and BorgWarner, the North American Class A is small. 12% of our business is what we call commercial vehicle. But it's pretty much a third North America, third Europe, and third China and rest of the world. And we are in off road, and agricultural construction. So don't associate North America Class 8 to BorgWarner commercial vehicle portfolio.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore.","Chris McNally","Thank you so much Tim. Just two quick ones, I think we've asked a lot about the core markets but just the math on getting to the bottom end of that minus 5% market range, I think you talked about China being flat where it was in December, but should we take that as essentially the market would have to be down on 15% in 2019 and Europe would be down to a couple of percent as well to hit the worst low end of that market range?","Thomas McGill","Yes. So if you're talking about the low end of the market range that would put China at minus 12 year-over-year, Europe around minus 5, and in North America around 3 to 4.","Chris McNally","Down 3 to 4?","Thomas McGill","Correct.","Chris McNally","December run rate.","Thomas McGill","That is based on average net year run rate, the year-over-year run rate.","Chris McNally","But you're coming to those numbers based on essentially if we would a run rate the sort of the worst levels that we saw in Q4 particularly in China and Europe. As you come up with those assumptions.","Thomas McGill","Yes. Plus North America weakening just a little bit from that 17.2% SAAR.","Chris McNally","And the second part is I really just wanted to hone in on Europe which we saw some of the weakness in the second half but we're sort of following the weakness in consumer confidence and some of the estimates and you know the first half is probably going to be down that minus 5%.","The unknown is sort of the second half of the year and we do have more tests particularly on the RDE. Could you talk about from the supplier perspective what you know about Q3 from speaking with the OEMs is you know - is this another situation where we could have a production issue associated with bottlenecks and like we did with WLTP, what sort of visibility are you getting in and how are you preparing for what would be another it should be a less onerous test. But how do you think about that as you prepare for your business?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","Yes. So our assumption is that Europe for the second half will be flat versus the second half of '18. I think our customers have done a great job you know getting lessons learned from the U.S. GDP. But clearly all the years is coming and is not going to be. It's not going to be done with no effort it's going to require a lot of work.","Chris McNally","And in terms of specific OEM or variances is there. I mean obviously everyone had their eye on Volkswagen for WLTP. So should we just think about that as the same big guys are going to have the same issues when it comes to RD? I mean we should focus on you know middle of the year seeing how well they execute it.","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","I would not. I think you should ask them directly. I wouldn't want to comment specifically for our customers.","Operator","Next question comes from David Kelly with Katherine.","David Kelly","Thanks for taking my questions. Just a quick follow up on the 80% backlog tied to hybrid and EVs. Are you seeing increased customer bias to go with hybrid and electric drive module solutions? I guess I was just hoping to get a feel for full module versus the component mix within the electrification backlog and maybe potential impact of that higher dollar content on the backlog growth?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","Yes we have a pull for system from a hybrid and electric standpoint, but it's the mix. We also, as I mentioned before, we also very open to support the customer with components and sometimes we do and we are happy to serve them with all the products that we have in this propulsion side of them of the market and of the technology.","David Kelly","So you're not seeing a substantial shift in how your customers are approaching components versus modules say versus last year.","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","And what, I think it was also mentioned in my prepared remarks in China we see a little bit more interest on modules than in the rest of the world. But it's the mix and we're happy to support them in any different shape or shape or form.","David Kelly","And then just a quick housekeeping on FX,. I think you referenced the first quarter your assumption of $1.13. Can you also provide your assumption I guess baked into the full year outlook.","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","Yes. It's about the same get $1.13 I think yeah. $1.13 for the full year.","Operator","We have time for one final question and that question comes from James Carillo with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","James Carillo","So just on your portfolio, you completed the sale of your thermostats business I believe you still have the EGR pipes and tubing business that you intend to sell as well. Any update there to confirm the remaining size of that business. And just a follow on do you have any other businesses within your portfolio that you'd be looking to prune as well.","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","Yeah. So with that thermostat business, we entered into an agreement where we were for final signing and everything which should be happening in the next few weeks if all goes according to plan. Your other question on portfolio for some of the other products that's an ongoing process for us. We're looking at that at all times looking at what makes sense for us.","And then there's a lot of different factors that go into that where we see the market, where we see our strength and our position in the market. So that's something that's an ongoing discussion with us.","James Carillo","Then just regarding your 2023 target you specifically called out in the prepared remarks that revenue and free cash flow is strongly intact. The $14 billion and $1 billion not to read too much into it but do you still regard the low 13% EBIT margin target as intact as well?","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","Yes.","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde","With that, I'd like to thank you all for your questions today. If you have any follow ups, feel free to reach out to me. Sharon you can close the call.","Operator","That does conclude the BorgWarner 2018 fourth quarter and full year results conference call.

My name is Denise, and I'll be your conference facilitator. At this time, I'd like to welcome, everyone, to the BorgWarner 2016 fourth quarter and full-year results conference call.","I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Nolan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Nolan, you may begin your conference.","Patrick Nolan - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you, Denise. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We issued our earnings release at 6:30 AM Eastern. It's posted on our website, borgwarner.com, and on our Investor Relations home page. A replay of today's call will be available through February 23. The dial-in number for that replay is 855-859-2056. You'll need the conference ID, which is 48637947. Or you can listen to the replay on our website.","With regard to our Investor Relations calendar between now and our next earnings release, we will be attending the Bank of America Automotive Summit in New York on April 12.","Before we begin the call, I need to inform you that during this call we may make forward-looking statements which will involve risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today.","Now, on to the today's call. First, James Verrier, our President and CEO, will comment on the industry as well as provide a high-level overview of our results, in addition will also discuss some of our recent product wins. Then Ron Hundzinski, our CFO, will discuss in detail of our results as well as our 2017 guidance.","Please note that we posted an earnings call presentation to the IR page of our website. You'll find a link in the Events and Presentation section beneath the notice for this call. We encourage you to follow along during our discussion.","With that, I'll turn it over to James.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thanks, Pat, and good morning, good afternoon to everybody. We appreciate you all joining us for our call here today. As Pat said, Ron and I are really pleased actually to share our results both from Q4 2016, but also some commentary about 2017.","I thought where would be good to start off is just share a few thoughts around the macro environment and some of the general industry trends, and talk a little bit how some of those play out specifically for us at BorgWarner.","So I think the headline for us, and I think all of us on the call here, we're operating, we continue to operate in a sense of uncertain times globally, both I think from a political perspective and on an economic perspective. Whether it's the transitions in Europe and Brexit, China economic stability and growth, and obviously here in the U.S. with the new administration, it's somewhat of an uncertain time.","If I take the areas that I think are most relevant to us from a BorgWarner perspective and I'll talk about, I think the two most meaningful things that are on people's mind. And I would say, it's the border adjustment or the NAFTA agreement here in the U.S. and also CAFE. So I just want to spend a couple of minutes proactively sharing some of our thoughts on those two topics with you.","So let me start off with border tax or NAFTA. First thing is to calibrate us all, obviously about 25% of BorgWarner's revenue is in North America, so now puts it a little bit into context to you. The second thing when you looked, when you break down that revenue, it's really critical that we all kind of understand that we produced most of our products, the vast majority of our products both in the United States and in Mexico. So we're very well balanced, which gives us the flexibility to adjust production levels between the two countries.","If you actually look at border flow, a traffic of our products and what products that move North or South of the border, the net-net of all of that is about $200 million. So our view of the world is, now you heard about $200 million on a $9 billion annual revenue total, that's quote for us, that's manageable, that's a manageable situation, particular with our flexibility of our footprint.","So we continue to track the topic closely of course, but I \u2013 my message to you from a BorgWarner perspective, we feel well-positioned around border tax and NAFTA.","The second subject that relates strongly to us, obviously, is around CAFE, and you know what if anything may evolve in that space. And I think, we're all aware that there's been, you know some discussion in the \u2013 particularly in the fourth quarter around revisiting the standards and adjusting the standards through the auto alliance recommendations. I think our view very simplistically produced that the line is going to continue to creep up. We're going to see more stringent fuel economy and emissions regulation. I think there could be some tweaking and adjustments of the line and the acceleration of the line, but there is no doubt in our mind, there would be a continued push for increased efficiency around fuel economy and emissions, and that plays really well.","What is critical is as that slope evolves, it may or it will influence that the mix of hybrid, electric and combustion. That's really what fundamentally will go on, and that's why it's been so important for us as a company over the last couple of years, to position our portfolio that is well balanced for combustion, hybrid and electric, so we'll become agnostic to the change. So, more to come on CAFE, but our belief is the standards will continue to drive forward, and we're well positioned.","So net-net these two big issues, that we track I think are very manageable for BorgWarner. The only other comment I would just highlight from a macro or industry perspective is \u2013 and I'll give a little color around market growth projections for 2017. I think we all should remind as of, we're operating in a pretty healthy environment from an auto perspective, something close to 94 million light vehicles produced this year, that's a pretty good number and a healthy basis to run our business from.","So staying with slide five, where I started, let me give a little bit of color on the market outlook, as we see it into 2017. So from a light vehicle perspective, I would characterize our view is very much aligned and similar to IHS's view. So we're seeing 1% or 2% growth projection for China. We see Europe growing modestly at about 1%, and then North American production down about 1%. So it's a low to no-growth environment overall, but as I said, that's off a very, very healthy base of 93-plus million light vehicles.","From a commercial vehicle perspective, I would characterize it as still a challenged space. We still see North America and Europe in a little bit of a down environment. We do see stabilization and a little bit of positiveness in South America, and we do see China getting better. But net-net, overall it's still a pretty challenging environment around commercial vehicle.","Now as we go into the year and we follow the year, I always like to share on these calls. One of the areas of watch that we're particularly paying a lot of attention to at BorgWarner that can move our numbers around, I would characterize three key areas of watch for the company. One is, we recognize we're in the mature cycle in North America. So what's going to transpire around inventories and schedules, thus far we're seeing schedules playing out pretty much as we had hoped for. But we will obviously, like everybody, keep a close eye on the inventory levels as the year unfolds.","I would say the second area of watch is diesel penetration share in Europe. We did see from 2015 to 2016, we saw about a 2% downshift in that mix between diesel and gas, and we do expect the penetration to continue to decline of diesel share in Western Europe versus gasoline.","The good news for us as a company, even with that little bit of a downshift last year, we still delivered our growth numbers and we're finding a way to offset that shift down in diesel. And as you look forward for us as a company, with the advent of our product evolution around content on gasoline and hybrid vehicles, that's going to put us in a very good position as diesel shifts down.","Last but not least, the other area we focus on, particularly with our strong backlog in China, is we're expecting modest growth in China. And we need to keep paying attention to that market a lot as well with \u2013 which is coming off the Chinese New Year. we keep a close eye on China, but I would say so far the signs are early but the signs are encouraging from a China market perspective.","All of that said, summarizing that view of the market outlook, we're very confident in our growth that we projected for 2017 by some of the demand for our products and what we're seeing in releases.","Let me just make a couple of comments on the regulatory or technology trend area. As I said earlier, we continue to see a very strong drive around fuel economy and emissions regulations, and the pull for advanced propulsion technology is as strong as I've ever seen it. So no change, no backing off on the drive and the pull for advanced technology. We see that around gas, hybrids, and EVs.","I would also like to just highlight that I think one of the really critical things that we see is that drive for advanced propulsion is very much globally playing out. So we see big pull in Europe and we see a very strong pull around hybrids and electrics also in China, but we also see continued advancements around combustion technology as well.","So as we look at our focus on electrification, our Q4 new business bookings continued to show a very positive trend for us in terms of the business we were winning with a wide range of customers and regions. And we did receive new awards in all three categories of propulsion systems, combustion, hybrids, and electrics.","Now I know many of you on the call like to keep score and keep track of numbers, so let me share a couple of numbers with you around awards. If you could cast your mind back to last year when we did our Investor Day, we talked about that we had 19 awards as a company for hybrids and electric programs that would be rolling out. And I would say to you in the fourth quarter, we added another handful to that list, so we're now sitting comfortably in the mid-20s type number of hybrid and electric vehicle program awards for the company. And our quoting activity remains very strong for other additional programs and customers. So the message there is still the strong pull for advanced technology and BorgWarner is winning.","Let me turn now for a little bit if I can and talk about financial recap. I think I would characterize for Ron and I both and the rest of the management team, we were very pleased both with our Q4 performance and full-year 2016. For 2016, our growth came in toward the high end of our guidance range and very solid operating performance. So we feel very good about how we delivered 2016. If I give a little more color, if I can on Q4, and obviously Ron will provide a lot more detail here. So for Q4, $2.3 billion was our sales number. That's up 6.6% organic excluding FX and Remy. If I compare that to how we did versus the market, when I do comparable end markets for us, it was about 3.6%, which is solid outperformance of about 3% growth for us in the quarter.","Regionally, it was pretty much as we had expected. We benefited from very strong growth in China, as we saw a very strong environment in China for light vehicle. And we had very strong growth in North America also.","I would say Europe for us was pretty flat, and this was a little bit offset also by some modest declines around the rest of Asia excluding China, aftermarket, and commercial vehicle off-road. All of that transpired into us delivering EPS of $0.85 when we exclude the non-comparable items, and that does include Remy. Our operating margin came at 12.6%, which we view as yet another solid quarter that we delivered.","If I take down the Q4 numbers by segment for a moment, so engine sales were $1.39 billion, so growing just over 1.3%. In the quarter, there was a little bit of headwind from light vehicle, diesel, and also I would say commercial vehicle weighed a little bit on our growth for the Engine segment, but you also see some really, really strong operating margin performance from the Engine group, which was really good to see.","Drivetrain sales coming in at $883 million, that's up almost 17% organically, which was a really strong quarter from Drivetrain on the growth side and the really good news around that, that was strong all-wheel drive sales, but also on our transmission business. And I would say it was pretty much around the world, but primarily in North America and Europe where we saw very strong growth in the Drivetrain segment.","If I turn now and talk a little bit about 2017 outlook, the first thing to reinforce is our outlook is unchanged from the guidance we provided just a few weeks ago last month when we were in Detroit. So recapping that a little for you, that's organic growth of 3.5% to 6% year over year, which we feel good about coming off of relatively flat market, that's good growth for us.","Our consolidated operating income margin is expected to grow about 40 to 50 basis points, and that will drive EPS guidance range of $3.35 to $3.45 per diluted share. I think the key point I would like to stress right now is we felt good and very confident about that guidance when we were with you in Detroit, and we feel exactly the same today. And on a slightly longer-term basis, we continue to believe that we're very strongly positioned to achieve that mid to high single-digit organic growth over the long-term.","As Pat said in his openings comments, I just wanted to take a moment to share a little bit more color around some of our growth and some of our recent winnings. And if you look at the slide, you'll see highlighted some key products on those slides. And the message here that I'm trying to convey is, you'll see winning business in combustion, hybrid and electric. And I'm just going to pick a few examples that highlight what I'm talking about.","One of the key products that we announced in the fourth quarter was our first electric drive module with an integrated transmission and we're going to be launching that on two EV vehicles for major Chinese OEMs and production will begin in the summer of 2017, which is pretty soon. Great example of our leadership position in propulsion for electric vehicles. You also see silent chain. This is really cool with Suzuki on their Solio hybrid vehicle where we're actually taking out chain technology, we're using two chains to transfer power from the electric motor to the transmission to power a hybrid vehicle. So it's a cool story of taking somewhat conventional combustion R&D technology from BorgWarner and applying that to a hybrid vehicle.","You also see we talked about advanced turbocharger technology for hybrid, electric vehicles, and the example here is the BYD in China. And I think this is a particularly relevant point because I think we showed you together in the Investor Day that we have seen a very strong adoption rate of turbochargers on hybrid vehicles. To give you a snapshot, as we look out to the middle of next decade, around 2026, we believe 56% of hybrids will be using turbochargers.","The fourth example that we've got up there is our advanced engine timing system for Alfa Romeo and that's on their 2-liter gasoline engine and this is a good example of some really advanced timing system technology that we've brought to the market that will continue to advance efficiency in the combustion powered vehicles.","So this is as I said is just four examples, it just gives you a little bit of a snapshot. Overall we continue to see very robust quoting activity with multiple customers, multiple products. And I'm very happy with what I see in our bookings, I'm very happy what I see in our win rates. And I really like the diversification and the balance across the portfolio of electric, hybrid and combustion. And I also like the profitability numbers that I see that are coming with those business wins.","So the message really is our balanced approach to drive in a broad variety of technology is absolutely working for us.","So let me try and wrap up and summarize a little bit for you. I think 2016 was a really good year for us. We delivered what we said we would. We knew going into 2016, it was super important that we delivered four good quarters and we did it. We did it on the top-line and we did it on the bottom-line and we feel very good about that, that just gives us confidence as we go into 2017. I think the business is operating very well and we continue to be focused on executing strong short-term performance, but also laser focused on delivering the growth for the long-term.","Comment also about M&A. M&A pipeline remained strong and active for us, and we're working very hard on that with our key focus on power electronics. So we really believe and we continue to believe we have a winning strategy that focuses us on delivering advanced propulsion technology for combustion, hybrid and electric vehicles that will absolutely deliver that mid-to-high single-digit organic growth that we've talked about.","Before I turn it over to Ron, I just did want to take just a quick moment to recognize in our press release, the details we've put in around asbestos. And Ron will clearly give a lot more detail on that, but I just wanted to give at least a comment from my office as the CEO. And I feel very good about the clarity that we're bringing to this issue, both internally and in our external disclosures.","We really understand this issue very well and we also understand the impact on our business, and now Ron will talk about that. I think for me what's really fundamental that I want to make sure is clear, is it is no change at all on our cash flow generation and how we go about running this growth company going forward.","So with that, let me stop there and turn the call over to Ron. Thank you.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you, James, and good day, everyone. Before I review the financials, I'd like to provide you some of the highlights as I see them for the quarter and the full-year. First, we had a solid growth in the quarter and we were slightly above our guidance for the quarter.","We saw great operating performance with the 17% incremental margins. And our 2016 free cash flow improved by nearly $245 million or almost doubled from 2015. And we exceeded our 2016 guidance by about $100 million at the midpoint. So I think we had a very great year. Now as Pat mentioned, I will be referring to the supplemental financial slide deck that is posted on our IR website and I do encourage you to follow along.","First, I'd like to focus your attention on slide 9. Throughout the presentation I will highlight certain non-U.S. GAAP measures to provide a clear picture of how the core business performed and for comparisons with prior periods. Specifically, we will be excluding the impact of FX, net M&A and Remy acquisition and divestiture of the light-duty aftermarket business and other non-comparable items from certain U.S. GAAP measures. So when you hear me say on a comparable basis, that means excluding all those impacts. When you hear me say on a reported basis that means U.S. GAAP.","So let's turn to slide 10. On a reported basis, sales were up 6.4%, but on a comparable basis, our sales were up 6.6% or nearly 7%, again solid growth.","On a reported basis, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 22.2% in the quarter, up 110 basis points from last year. On a reported basis, SG&A was 9.6% of sales. R&D spending, which is included in SG&A was 3.8% of sales in the quarter. On a comparable basis, SG&A was 9% of sales, up 80 basis points from a year ago. There's three reasons for the increase. First, R&D spending, as I mentioned was up by 10 basis points, 40 basis points is related to a stock-based comp true-up for the quarter, and a remaining 30 basis points is related to various increases in compliance cost.","So now let's look at the year-over-year comparison for operating income, which can be found on slide 11. On a comparable basis, Q4 operating profit improved to $284 million, or 12.6% of sales compared to $269 million in Q4 of 2015. Where on an organic basis operating income was up $24 million on a $139 million of higher sales, that gives us an incremental margin of 17% in the quarter, a great finish to the year. The full-year incremental margin on a comparable basis was 15%.","As you look further down in the income statement, equity in affiliate earnings was about $11 million in the quarter, down from $12 million last year. Interest expense and finance charges were $20 million in the quarter, which is basically flat from last year. Provision for income taxes in the quarter on a reported basis was a benefit of a $183 million primarily, because of the asbestos charge. However, this \u2013 the non-comparable item is really asbestos. You can read more about each of these adjustments in our 10-K, which will be filed later today, but if we exclude all the non-comparable items to provision for the income taxes was about $85 million for an effective tax rate of 11.5% for the quarter, or for the full-year effective tax rate of about 30.9%, very close to 31% that we guided all year.","Net earnings attributable to non-controlling interests was about $12 million, up $2 million from the fourth quarter 2015, this time it reflects our minority partner share in the earnings and performance of our Korean and Chinese consolidated joint ventures. Earnings per share on a reported basis was a negative $1.39. On a comparable basis, net earnings were $0.85 per share.","So let's switch to the segments now, which begins on slide 12. Reported Engine segment net sales were $1.39 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the Engine segment on a comparable basis was 1.3% as demand for our light vehicle OEM products were offset by a weak aftermarket and off-road commercial vehicle markets around the world. Adjusted EBIT was $248 million for the Engines segment, or 17.9% of the sales. On a comparable basis the Engines segment adjusted EBIT was up $24 million on $18 million in sales for incremental margin of a 133% due to strong cost performance in the quarter.","Turning to slide 13 and starting on the right, Drivetrain segment net sales were $883 million in the quarter. This includes $37 million of net sales from Remy activity, when I refer to the activity, I'm talking about the purchase last year and then the subsequent aftermarket sale in the fourth quarter of this year. So sales growth for Drivetrain segment on a comparable basis was up 16.9%, primarily due to higher all-wheel drive and transmission component sales, as James mentioned earlier. This is a very strong sales growth for this segment.","Adjusted EBIT was $91 million for the Drivetrain segment, or 10.3% of sales. Excluding Remy and currency, adjusted EBIT was 11% of sales, flat from the prior year. On a comparable basis, the Drivetrain segment's adjusted EBIT was up $13 million on $123 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 11%.","Now, let's take a look at our balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $1.035 billion of net cash from operating activities in 2016, which is up by $168 million from 2015. Capital spending was $101 million in the quarter, down $77 million from a year ago. CapEx was 5.5% of sales.","Free cash flow, which we define as net cash from operating activities less net capital spending was $545 million in 2016, which is up $250 million from a year ago. Again, like I said in my opening remarks, this exceeded our 2016 guide as a midpoint by $100 million, we had a great cash flow year and quarter.","Looking at the balance sheet itself, balance sheet debt decreased by $331 million and cash decreased by $134 million, compared with the end of 2015. The $197 million decrease in net debt was primarily due to the settlement of a 10-year senior note coming due, lower revolver debt offset by share repurchases. We spent $288 million repurchasing just under 8.3 million shares in 2016. Our net debt-to-capital ratio is 35% at the end of 2016 and that's down from 35.2% at the end of 2015. Net debt-to-EBITDA at the end of the year was 1.15 times.","Turning to slide 14 now, in Q4, as James mentioned, we recorded a charge of $441 million net of tax and expected insurance recoveries for estimated asbestos-related liabilities for historical automotive products that went out of production in the late 1980s and were manufactured by a legacy legal entity of ours. This amount primarily relates to estimated pending and potential future claims for an additional 50 years. This is net of estimated insurance recoveries. I do encourage you to read the disclosures in our 10-K, which is planned to be filed later today.","The important details around this charge are as follows. First, it's non-cash charge net of our insurance recoveries. Second, it's not a discounted value, the number is nominal. The impact on cash flow should be viewed like this. We have paid claims since 2004 more than we have recovered from insurance companies, and the cash amounts have been reflected within our operating cash flows since that time. While we continue to collect from insurance companies under existing agreements and continue to litigate and pursue settlements with those, we have not reached agreement with every single insurance company. We expect that the annual future cash outflows for the next 5 to 10 years will be closely mirrored to what we have seen in the recent past and handle it in the same manner. And finally, none of this currently impacts our strong operating performance, our strong revenues and cash flows. Again, I would refer you to the disclosure in our 10-K that covers all the details around this. And in addition, Pat and I will welcome your calls later on.","All right. Switching gears. I think it's important that we go over our 2017 guidance in detail again, despite the fact we did it at a conference earlier in January, just so everybody can be clear on this. So let's start with our sales growth for the full year on slide 16.","Backlog, pricing, and market-related growth are expected to drive 3.5% to 6% organic sales growth. I'd like to note the net unfavorable market growth pricing amount in that number. Our assumption is that our weighted average market growth is about 0.6% with a negative pricing of 1.4%. Currency is expected to reduce sales by $320 million, or 360 basis points. All this nets to 2017 sales at the midpoint of $8.925 billion.","Next, I'll walk our operating income on slide 17. From a performance perspective, we continue to expect mid-teens incremental margin on our sales growth. Included in this are some tailwinds and headwinds. The tailwinds include continued improvements from Wahler and Remy, offset by expected headwinds from commodity prices and corporate costs. We do expect an inflationary environment in commodities and rising compliance cost. Our consolidated operating income margin is expected to expand by 40 to 50 basis points.","To finish up, our full-year guidance, please turn to slide 18. EPS guidance range is $3.35 to $3.45 per diluted share. Free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx, is expected to be in the $450 million to $500 million range. Capital spending, which does include tooling, is expected to be in the range of $475 million to $525 million.","We expect to continue executing our share repurchase program, targeting about $100 million or plus depending on our M&A activity in 2017. R&D spending as a percentage of sales is expected to be about 4%. The tax rate is expected to be up slightly at about 32% due to more cash repatriated from Asia.","Our assumption for the dollar-to-euro exchange rate is $1.05 for the full year, although I'd note that it is slightly higher right now. As a reminder, for every $0.01 change in the dollar to euro exchange rate equals about $30 million to $35 million of sales for us on a full-year basis.","Now I'd like to switch to slide 20 to talk about the first quarter guidance, first sales. Note that Remy light vehicle aftermarket sales divested are about $70 million, so the starting point is at the base of $2.2 billion. Net of new business, pricing and market related growth are expected to drive organic sales growth of about 2.5% to about 6.5%. Currency is expected to reduce sales growth between 270 basis points. Therefore, 2017 Q1 sales is expected to be $2.24 billion at the midpoint.","From an EPS perspective on slide 21, we expect negative $0.01 to $0.02 per share from operations perspective. This doesn't include the headwinds from commodities and corporate costs, which are more weighted to Q1 from a comp perspective. Foreign currencies are expected to lower earnings by about $0.03 per share in the quarter as well.","Below the operating income line items are expected to contribute about $0.02 per share. Primarily, it's related to the lower share count, offset by a little bit higher tax. On a consolidated basis, we expect earnings of $0.81 to $0.85 per share.","So let me summarize a few things right now. When we look back, 2016 was a great year for us. We executed very well on the top line, slightly above our guide, and basically hit our metrics on the top and bottom line.","We grew mid-single digits, like I said, and exceeded the sales guidance. We expanded our operating margin by about 10 basis points on a comparable basis. I'd like to point out that even with the dilutive aspect of Remy in there, we significantly improved that cash flow as I went through in the script here. In addition, we returned about $400 million in capital in the form of share buybacks and dividends to shareholders.","Now as I look forward to 2017 and beyond, we see improvements in a couple key areas. Again, single-digit growth despite being in a flat environment, and we also expect our margins to expand as well in 2017. So first and foremost, it is important that the intensity around our new product development to support the impending electrification trend has never been higher, as James talked about, and actually gave you some clarity around some of the more recent wins that we've been seeing. There is no question in our mind that we'll drive growth for many years going forward.","So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat to lead some Q&A.","Patrick Nolan - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thanks, Ron. Denise, we're open for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks for taking my question. Can you talk a little bit about your sales performance in China in the quarter? How it tracked relative to your own expectations versus the industry? Maybe remind us of any disproportionate over- or under-exposures you have there to certain automakers or segments that maybe performed better or worse than the industry overall?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. Let me take a shot at that Ryan. So I would characterize it this way, I think where we landed in the fourth quarter versus where we thought we would at the beginning, if that makes sense to you is we got, it was a stronger quarter than what we had anticipated going into the quarter. And I think that's pretty consistent to what others have said. We did go in and expecting to outperform and grow at a double-digit number in China and we did a little better than that.","So we grew well above the market, I don't have an exact percent for you Ryan, but Pat can get that to you offline, but we went in, expecting very strong growth and it came in even better than that and our market outperformance held even in that stronger environment, if that helps you. And again, Pat can get you.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Ryan, I actually have that number, James.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Okay.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","It grew about nearly 30%.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Ron.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Wow \u2013 it's impressive.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","In China.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Very good, thank you. And then last question from me: you've been pretty clear about your desire to expand your engine electronics capabilities, maybe via inorganic. I mean can you just talk about what the acquisition environment in general looks like out there right now? Has it been affected much by the increase in the equity markets since your last earnings call? Then, is it also maybe your capital allocation decisions, could they be impacted by any sort of holiday on taxation of repatriation of cash overseas, et cetera?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Let me say a couple things, Ryan. First and foremost, in terms of adding and expanding our capabilities around electronics and power electronics, it's important actually to know it's both organic and an M&A play, so we've been continuing to build and add capability and capacity organically, fundamentally through hiring the folks and we continue to do that, but specifically we were also looking to add through M&A.","We do have a number of targets that were \u2013 we see and we're engaged in various levels of dialogue. I would say there's nothing externally in the marketplace that would be holding us back, if that makes sense, Ryan. So it's just purely a function of identifying the right technology capability within the company and then convincing them to sell, I mean that's the fundamental issue. So there is nothing \u2013 there is no overhang in terms of regulatory environment, in terms of as Ron alluded to, in terms of that capital deployment. We're ready to go do what we need to do. And the team is doing a great job of pursuing a number of targets. And it'll just be a case of getting one or more of those over the line as we can, Ryan.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Your line is open.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Now I have a couple of questions. First, can you \u2013 this is more housekeeping. You mentioned in Detroit about the \u2013 couple things related to what may happen with taxes. First, you did say, you could repatriate some cash this year. That's behind your higher-tax rate guidance. Yet the prospects for tax reform are certainly out there. Do you have flexibility to wait to get clarity on the new administrations tax fund?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","All right. This is Ron, Brian, okay. First, let's talk about the current environment that we operate for BorgWarner. We've worked very hard over the last couple of years to put in place what I would say is a very liquid repatriation strategy. And as I said, we bring cash back from Asia and we are bringing cash back from Europe, and we are comfortable where we sit right now to be able to bring cash back, if nothing were to change now. We all noticed something is going to change here. Going forward, there is two bills that everybody knows is the blueprint and then there is the Trump. We've analyzed it very carefully.","There are some friction costs, as you get into this tax structure. It's going to be very complicated and create a lot of friction issues. Our perspective is in the long run, I think it's net-net benefit for BorgWarner, but it would take some time to get to that benefit. Now James has also said that in his opening remarks that we are very flexible in North America and we can compensate for that tax cover to change very quickly. We could start taking some flexibility actions that would put us in a more neutral position.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. But is that just looking at the border tax part of it and not the 20%...","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Right.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","...offset, because I thought you said in Detroit that he might pay more on imports but could be offset by a 20% tax rate.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Right. So I was referring to a just a border tax rate...","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Right.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","...that we would have to adjust our potential manufacturing footprints in North America, that's one aspect to it, but we have that flexibility. And then as you get into the absolute corporate tax rate, whatever you picked the 15% or 20%, once we get there to the friction transaction part of it, that I think coupled with the repatriation would basically be free to come back in the future. In the long run, it's very beneficial for us.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. So two quick follow-up questions. First that, I have seen a number, I think from Detroit, around $200 million of U.S. net imports. Is that the right starting point to think about?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","That's correct.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Second, I guess my question back, and thank you for all the detail on border adjustment tax, was simply: if you start seeing bills in Congress that would lower the corporate tax rate and provide a repatriation holiday, could you defer that tax repatriation, the cash repatriation plan for this year, and hence not get the cash this year but not suffer a higher effective tax rate?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","I understand the theory behind what you're saying there, Brian, that's something we'd have to take into consideration and that there was certainty where that tax is actually going to be passed then we would probably take something. The most important part is that we can be flexible depending on what we see actually is going to happen in the tax code.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Okay. So it's not some strange required distribution.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","No.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And then just final question, and I will just throw it out there, and I'm sure will you go into more detail on other questions. That 133% incremental margin over an Engine, clearly with flat revenue there's a lot of cost take-out that drove that. Is that the new base of operating costs that we ought to think about? Or is there a reason not to get too far ahead of where op margins would go when there's actually rev growth.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Brian...","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Which I assume we're not going to model at a 133%?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","I don't model at a 133%. I think a different perspective than focusing on the quarter is really the focus is on the full-year margin that that segment did, and the margin expansion was actually pretty impressive. So I would model a full year and then I would also model for the full year margin \u2013 some margin expansion probably in top of that. Okay. But, no, don't launch the fourth quarter, that's \u2013 I wouldn't go there with that. Okay?","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Leiker with Baird. Your line is open.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Good morning, all.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Hey, David.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","I have one question on this asbestos charge. It would seem to me, and we've seen some other companies take a similar charge to this, that you are in a position that you can estimate this out, going out 50 years versus whatever did you before, and that, that's the majority of what the charge is for?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Correct.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","So there's no adverse experiences?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","No. So okay, I see you what you're getting at, David. Let me just take a moment maybe and give a little bit more color around this instead of just answering quickly. So basically, over the last several years, management has done some strategic initiatives on the defense side of this and put some stringent litigators in place, that's resulted in a very predictable environment for us on that side of it. That coupled with a very stabilized tort system came together at the same time, so that we're able to take a look at some actuary's people come in, some other professionals and have a very predictable stable environment.","We're now \u2013 we're comfortable and actually making a 50-year estimate. In the past, we didn't have that type of environment. So it's kind of a convergence of several things coming together, that's mostly predictable. That's the most important word that I'm going to say here, it's predictable now.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yes.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","It wasn't predictable before.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yes, there are a couple of other companies in the same position who have done something very similar to this. So thanks on that. I was hoping that we could dig a little bit deeper into the revenue number here, a touch. Is there a way for Q4 and for 2016 to give us some sense of the geographic revenue performance, North America, Europe, Asia?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. I can \u2013 let me \u2013 I'll try and take a shot at it for Q4, David. So as I think earlier, if you caught the earlier questions, from a China perspective, let me stop there. Ron said that, we grew it about 30% in the quarter year-over-year, which was pretty amazing. Obviously, if you look at what their production numbers were in China, that represents obviously very, very significant outperformance from us.","We grew just about double-digit in North America, which again represents pretty solid outperformance. Europe, I would say, we would kind of below the market \u2013 light vehicle market in Europe, but that's a little bit history, where we have commercial vehicle in aftermarket revenue, a lot in Europe. So that's kind of a quick characterization. We can \u2013 Pat and I or Ron can give you a bit more of a full year view if you want offline, David, or in a follow-up call. I just don't have a good visibility on that in front of me. But that gives you a little bit of a sense for the quarter. Strong in \u2013 strong outgrowth in North America and China, and Europe about in line slightly down, it would be a way to think of it.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great, thanks. And then just one last one. On slide 7, where you labeled the recent product announcements. A bit curious, six months ago now or so that we talked about at your Analyst Day and trying to put some numbers around these types of products. I'm curious as you're booking the contracts and you get deeper into this process of building the backlog in these non-internal combustion products whether your content, your market share, the size of volume, unit volumes \u2013 just some characterization there of how that's tracking relative to what you would have talked about back in September.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. I can spend a couple minutes on that David. So just a real quickly recap, obviously we talked about the three architectures combustion, hybrid and electric. What we basically said around combustion back at Investor Day was this is \u2013 the combustion is a flat market basically, it's about 88 million vehicles in 2016, and it stays about that slightly down, BorgWarner's revenue growth is about 5% over that same period 2016 through 2023, and we get that two ways, we get that through increased penetration rates, and we also ramp-up a little bit on our content per vehicle. So combustion goes from 185 to 250.","So if you bear with me, and if I do that same kind of approach on hybrid, David, we have a compound annual growth rate of about 50%-something, over that period 2016 through 2023. Again that's delivered through significant penetration \u2013 vehicle penetration, where we go from about 20% up to 40%-something, and again content per vehicle climbs significantly.","Similar story on electrics, where we continue to see significant growth content per vehicle evolves there as well. The upshot of all of that David, is if I was to say where are we sitting here today in February versus where we were, when we were in Investor Day. I would say we're on track, if anything slightly better or slightly ahead of where we thought we were back in September. And slightly ahead means, what I'm actually seeing as get over the line in bookings in hybrids and electrics and combustion. So we feel probably slightly more comfortable than what we even did back in September based on the evidence over the last four months or five months of booking. In all three areas David, that's the key all three.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Patrick Nolan - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thanks, David.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Kelley with Jefferies. Your line is open.","David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. And thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of follow-ups here. Maybe if you could provide some additional color on the Remy business, maybe how it's progressing relative to your expectations, areas of outperformance, underperformance; and what you think about the Remy opportunity for 2017 would be great.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Let me take a shot if I can, David. I would say we were about a year into this. And so real briefly, I would say fundamentally it's performed pretty much as we'd expected. Top line is pretty much there other than a little bit of end market weakness. Operating-wise, it performed pretty much as expected. I would say the technology strength and depth that we've been pleased with in terms of the breadth and the strength of the product portfolio.","I think the one incremental area that I would say is a little better than what we thought from when we went in is we're seeing the opportunity to combine the Remy product with the traditional BorgWarner product to differentiate ourselves with our customers on technology solutions, and we saw that with the electric drive module would be a great example very recently. So I would say that's how I would characterize that.","I think the other element that we feel very good about was the divestiture of the non-core light vehicle aftermarket business. I think that was a really important move for us in a number of fronts, so we feel good about that. So now as we go into this year, the focus, David, just to give you a number in the three-year backlog, we characterize the rotating electric portion of our backlog was about 12%, which was up significantly from a year ago. And that's coming from two aspects. One is what I alluded to earlier, which is the combining of the Remy core technology with the BorgWarner technology to offer system solutions for our customers. And then the second area is finding ways to gain share with the more legacy product set of Remy, so basically selling more starters and alternators. Now we've got to leverage with BorgWarner than Remy did in its former life.","So net-net all around, David, we're feeling very good about it. It's contributing from a top line perspective in a good way. And we're starting to get some traction on the margin improvements. Remember, when we started this business, it was about a 4% operating margin business. We'll get some incremental uplift this year without having the non-core aftermarket business, and we're comfortable we can expand margins on the core Remy business. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of color, David, to help.","David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC","Great, I appreciate the color there, just a quick follow-up on turbochargers and then I will pass it along. Regionally, how do you view the category opportunity heading into 2017? What could be markets of outperformance or underperformance? And along that note, if we're thinking about the eBooster technology ramp, how is that progressing? Where are we over the next two to three years with eBoosters? That would be great.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","So just from a turbo perspective in its general sense, the core story there really is we're seeing obviously significant penetration uplifts in North America and China. That's where the growth story is playing out. Europe is obviously pretty much a saturated space in terms of turbocharger penetration. And I would say to you that's playing out as we expected. We're seeing rapid adoption rates in China and in North America. And Pat could give you some detail numbers offline if it's helpful, David. So we're seeing that play out.","From our BorgWarner perspective, our market share expectations are playing out exactly as we thought. So we're winning where we thought we would win and we're doing well from a share perspective. So I would say that's encouraging too.","And eBooster, we continue to get more and more traction there. We have a couple of production awards \u2013 or in production I should say in 2017 with a couple of key customer programs, and we see continued pull and demand for eBooster programs that we're quoting on and doing very well with. So we see that trend continuing from a technology point of view, and we're getting our share and doing quite well in winning that business. So hopefully that gives you some sense, David.","David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC","All right, perfect. Thanks again.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Good morning, Brett.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Hi, Brett.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","A 30,000-foot question, and it's just this. Combustion, hybrid, electric, it seems like regionally we're seeing them grow at different pace, and China seems to be focused heavily on electric. So can you talk about the combustion, hybrid, and electric growth rates in the different regions?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","I can take a shot at that, Brett, at least start on that for you. I would say first, your assumption is right where the lead space, if I can call it that, for electric is in China. So we are seeing more focus, more drive around pure electrics in China regionally than other parts of the world, but we are obviously seeing electric production rates in Europe and North America also. I would say all three regions somewhat equally are looking to optimize combustion technologies, so we're seeing that. And I would say that's pretty uniform around the world in terms of refinement optimization on combustion.","Hybrid, also I would say regionally there's a pull, probably an equal pull for hybrids in the different regions of the world. Brett, what I would say to you on hybrids, where there's not a lot of difference regionally, you are getting different customer strategies around hybrids, and that's where Borg is playing a really key role because they're looking at different hybrid architectures, different ways of getting there, and that's where we're playing a strong role in helping them.","So a little bit of regional variation, but I think ultimately I would say, Brett, the critical 30,000th point for us is, we've seen all the OEMs needing a balance of the three architectures and we're there to help them with that balance of the three. That's the really critical part.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you very much, James.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thanks, Brett.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Good morning, Rich.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Just two quick ones. On the regional split of these new wins, James, just as a follow-up, any difference? Is that pretty spread evenly? And then the second one would be for Ron on the buyback. The $100 million-plus, what moves that up meaningfully from there? What would you have to see? What's the scenario?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","I'll go to buyback quickly.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah, sure.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","As I said on the buyback, it's all going to depend on our M&A activity, Rich. We have some things that we're looking at right now. And if they look like they're not going to materialize till end of the year or next year, we would move it up.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","In terms, Rich, of the new wins, so to speak, it is pretty balanced regionally. I put those four examples up, Rich. I see that's a good characterization or a good representation of actually how it's playing out. So you've got a really advanced electric vehicle system that's in \u2013 at a China. You've got the latest and greatest turbocharger technology that's in Asia and China. Suzuki, as you see Alfa Romeo is a European, but I wouldn't be surprised when I show you the \u2013 in the next call, another four. They could be North American or whatever, see. I'm \u2013 it is pretty balanced. Both regionally, Rich, but also across the combustion, hybrid and electric propulsion space. It's pretty balanced.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thanks, Rich.","Operator","Your next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, everybody, just a high-level question. Your OEM customers have recently been fairly outspoken in putting real money behind the propulsion changes, and obviously you're seeing that in your order and quoting activity. But sometimes when we have conversations with them, they suggest that, that could create some volatility in their results as they make the pivot from internal combustion to EVs. If I'm not mistaken, the message you've been giving pretty consistently now is that, while not easy, you're confident that you can make that pivot while maintaining the incremental margins kind of like phase-in, phase-out, without really any blip.","I'm not holding you to like exact science here, but it seems like your current level of this 17%, 18% with an engine, for example, that we're not going to be in a position a year or so from now where, due to that pivot and some of the internal investments, expenses, you don't think that, that's \u2013 you don't see that, have visibility of that creating a near term and necessary blip to capture this great revenue opportunity going forward. Is that accurate from a perspective?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Adam, it's James. So I would say, that's a pretty \u2013 a pretty good description you gave, and I would give you a little bit color of \u2013 kind of why I think that is, because I think it's a \u2013 if I can say it this way, it's an incremental evolution to the end game. They're not \u2013 and I think, you've seen this yourself, that it's not a light switch, where we're turning off from \u2013 turning off combustion and turning on the light, it's a \u2013 it's a \u2013 it's kind of a journey and it's an evolution.","And the reason that's important, that does a couple of things, that allows us to be thoughtful and balanced in terms of making our investments, and evolving the portfolio as opposed to throw all of it away and bring a brand-new third on that we've never done before. And that's why we have the comfort and the confidence in the kind of evolution, because it's not a light switch type event. The other quick comment I would make Adam, that gives us incremental confidence is, as I've alluded to sort of last year, we are in production with hybrid technology, we're in production with electric vehicle technology.","And we've been doing that over the last three years to four years, and still delivering the incrementals over that period of time. And what we're also seeing is the financial performance of those electric and hybrid vehicles is very good. So I don't want to characterize Adam, that this is easy, I don't want to tell you that, but I would tell you, we feel comfortable that this is more of an evolution than an event and we're comfortable, we can manage through it and deliver what we're saying we're going to do.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co.

Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","James, just I guess very high level: there was a smaller turbo competitor out there that's up for sale. I think it confirms a lot about what you have been saying about this market over the years. I was curious, is that helping you at all on the margin in bidding, given uncertain future ownership there? And does that have any \u2013 does that asset have any strategic value to BorgWarner?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thanks for bringing that up, Joe. I think your note characterized it actually pretty well, frankly. So Bosch Mahle rough numbers is about 4% to 5% market share. And I think what it really, really confirmed is the barriers to entry in that turbo space a pretty hard, it's pretty tough and I think you alluded to that and we would confirm that. So lot of technology, lot of IP, lot of manufacturing capabilities et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, investment business. And yeah we defend that very, very strongly. And I think you see there is some, it's a tough space for them to do.","In terms of how it plays out, I think we'll have to see candidly. We will see what plays out in terms of what happens with that asset. We do feel extremely positive about our position frankly speaking in turbo and we have about a third share.

Sponheimer - G.research LLC","Hi, thanks for sneaking me in here. Just one confirmation, Ron, on the asbestos charge. Looking back to your 2015 10-K there was some discussion about insurance recovery. This is in no way any sort of comment about your ability to recover from insurance companies what you expect to receive, correct?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Correct. All we really did is, we \u2013 that there are two types of liabilities out there, one of them when people file claims, we had to do an estimate of what we expected those settlements to be, which we've always had out there, and we had an asset and liability. What we did is we true that up, but then more importantly, we took a look at the universe of what we call IBNR incurred, but not reported yet. What we did is, we took a look at that as well, and what we did is we took a look at for 50 years, put that on that balance sheet and then our insurance receivables are still out there. I'd encourage you, really to take a look at the 10-K that we filed today, it gives more clarity around it, and also it gives you more of what the asset values and liabilities are on the balance sheet, okay. I don't want to spend a lot of time on the call going through all those details, but there's there is a lot of clarity, I think in the K that we're going to put out today, around this issue.","Brian C.

Could you talk a little bit how we should think about growth split, maybe between the divisions in 2017; and as the follow-on, how to think about incremental margins by division over the next couple of quarters?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","I would say, Chris, if you think of what we did in the three-year backlog, where we broke out, the products actually by discrete products, but then also you can clearly see what's Engine and what is Drivetrain. My sense is, I would think that's probably a pretty good barometer for \u2013 on an annual basis, is a good way to think of it. So we provided the detailed breakdown there by product and by segment for you in the three-year view. I don't think you'll go too far wrong if you view the one-year view somewhat similar to the three-year view, if that's helpful for you.","Chris McNally - Evercore ISI","Okay. So there shouldn't be any weird comps in terms of the growth as we think about over 2017.","James R.

Please see the Events section of our Investors Relations homepage for a full list.","Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements, which involves risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today.","During today's presentation, we will highlight certain non-GAAP measures in order to provide a clearer picture of how the core business performs and for comparison purposes of prior periods. When you hear us say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of FX and net M&A. When you hear us say adjusted, that means excluding non-comparable items. And when you hear us say organic, that means excluding the impact of FX and net M&A.","We will also refer to our growth compared to our market. When you hear us say market, that means the change in light vehicle production weighted for our geographic exposure. Our outgrowth is defined as our organic revenue change versus the market.","Now back to today's call. First, Fred Lissalde, our President and CEO, will comment on our Q1 results and our 2019 outlook. This will be followed by a high-level overview of our joint venture agreement with Romeo Power. Fred will conclude with a discussion of our recent product highlights. Then Kevin Nowlan, our CFO will discuss the industry outlook, as well as details of our results and guidance. Please note that we have posted an earnings call presentation to the IR page of our Web site. We encourage you to follow along with these slides during our discussion.","With that, I'll turn it over to Fred.","Fred Lissalde","Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased to share our results from Q2 2019 today and provide an overall company update.","Let me start with the highlights of the quarter on Slide 5. I am pleased with the sequential improvements in our outlook. With more than $2.5 billion in sales, we were down about 0.3% organically. This compares to our market being down 5.7%. So, our outgrowth was approximately 540 basis points in the quarter, which was ahead of our expectations.","Regionally, we saw outgrowth in all major regions. Our European light vehicle revenue was up 2%, outperforming the industry decline by more than 9%. Our North American light vehicle revenue was at up 4% year-over-year with 600 basis points of outgrowth. Our China revenue declined about 10% versus industry production decline of 16%. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1 with our operating income performance at the midpoint of our guidance. And higher than expected tax rates was a $0.02 headwind. I'm also pleased with our stronger year-to-date cash performance that Kevin will discuss in detail.","As we focus on near term execution in this challenging market, we also, at the same time maintaining an equal focus on investing in the long-term. In the second quarter, we closed on our Romeo Power investment, which positions us to be a leading player in battery management, and I'll speak about this in a couple of slides. We also continue to deliver new wins in hybrid and electric, which is positioning us to deliver continued revenue outgrowth. Overall, Q2 was a solid result compared to an industry backdrop, which continued to weaken throughout the quarter.","Now, I would like to address our full year 2019 guidance, which is on Slide 6. While we were encouraged by the better than expected outgrowth in the first half, we expect our full year revenue to be in the bottom half of our prior revenue range. We expect revenue to be down 2.5% to flat organically. This is based on an industry assumption of down 3.5% to down 5% with the high end being 150 basis points lower than our prior assumption.","We expect our outgrowth to be in the 250 basis points to 350 basis points range for the full year. We expect our adjusted earnings per share to be between $3.75 to $4. This guidance reflects our updated revenue outgrowth outlook, and additional margin pressure for the continuing production volatility and weaker cost performance from our supply basis.","To be clear, we're not satisfied with our margin performance in the full year '19. Margin performance has historically being one of our strengths, and we are focused on maintaining that discipline. In order to meet our long-term margin and cash generation objectives, we are taking more aggressive steps to adapt our cost structure to the challenges facing our business. This will include more steps to manage our near term cost and more aggressive restructuring measures than the ones we have previously announced.","While we will continue to manage the current volume environment and cost pressures, we will continue to secure our future growth through new business awards supplemented with M&A investments. Consistent with this, during this quarter, we announced our plans to enter into a joint venture with Romeo Power who we view as a technology leading battery module and pack supplier. It's a good fit between the two companies.","Romeo Power has excellent technologies and we provide the customer reach and comfort level, as well as the capability to reply and produce at scale and globally. BorgWarner will own 60% interest in the joint venture. It will also complement our existing portfolio and expand our system expertise for electric propulsion. Finally, we believe this joint venture can fill the gaps in the marketplace between and hybrid and electric vehicle makers.","Next, I will point you to Slide 8, which illustrates our competitive advantage in EVs. The products in blue are products that we now have capabilities to produce in-house. This is what positions us strongly for future growth. We are one of the few with products covering energy management from grid to wheel. Upstream of the battery, we have onboard charges, and we are active in the stationery charging business as well.","Downstream of the battery, we supply motors, transmission and power electronics. We can supply these components individually or as an integrated module. We complement our proportion offering with cabin and battery heating technologies, for which we also see a strong market pull. And now with our battery pack JV, we can supply the battery packs and thermal management systems as well. We can develop, specify and manufacture all the major components of a battery electric vehicle propulsion system. Our product breadth is really our advantage.","Now, I would like to discuss some of our product successes, which are on Slide 9. We continue to innovate in combustion proportion. This quarter, we announced that our innovative regulated two stage turbocharging system will be used on BMW Group's latest two liter twin-power engine. Innovation is still occurring in combustion propulsion. And our technologies are helping automakers comply with increasingly stringent regulations worldwide.","I am strongly encouraged by our year-to-date wins across multiple hybrid architectures and products for electric vehicle. We have booked hybrid and electric business in Europe, Asia and North America. While we cannot share all of the customers or program specific details at this time, we have received awards across multiple hybrid platforms, including P1, P2, and P3.","One example is a high volume P3 hybrid system for a major European OEM. For this system, we're supply a motor generator unit, which power electronics and software, gear set and disconnect controls. In EVs, our cabin heaters are also continuing to win new business. Importantly, we expect to see additional wins across hybrid and electric in the second half of 2019, and I am very pleased with this.","So let me summarize by opening remarks this morning. Q2 saw a recovery in our growth as expected, but we expect a challenging second half. We will take the necessary actions to adjust our costs to the current environment, and we are encouraged by our year-to-date wins in the three regions of the world across multiple hybrid and electric vehicle architectures. This positions us strongly for the future.","Now, let me turn it over to Kevin.","Kevin Nowlan","Thank you, Fred and good morning everyone. Before I review the financials in detail, I'd like to provide you a quick overview of the two key drivers of our second quarter results.","First, our revenue outgrowth was ahead of our expectations at 540 basis points in the quarter. This was driven primarily by higher volumes and new programs, especially in Europe and North America. We also benefited from some amount of pull forward of launch volume from Q3. And we remain on track for full year revenue outgrowth of 250 to 350 basis points.","Second, cost pressures continued to be a headwind during the quarter, which drove all inbound site conversion of 27% and prevented us from hitting the upper end of our adjusted EPS guidance range. Nonetheless, we still achieved performance within our Q2 guide, but we're disappointed that we didn't deliver a stronger result.","Let's turn to Slide 11 where you can see our perspective on industry production. Let me start with Q2. Global light vehicle production came in about 5.7% lower on a year-over-year basis, which was slightly worse than the midpoint of our expectations going into the quarter. Within that global result, we saw European production down about 7% against the fairly tough comparison from last year. China production was down 16% as that market continues to remain under pressure. And North America declined by about 2%.","As we look ahead to the remainder of 2019, we expect that the challenging industry conditions will continue. On a full year basis, we now expect the market decline to be in the minus 3.5% to minus 5% range. The stronger end of this outlook is 150 basis points lower than our prior expectation. Also as part of outlook, we're now planning for China to be down anywhere from 10% to 14% on a full year basis, while Europe is likely to be down 3% to 4.5%, and North America down to the 3%. This new market outlook means we have become even more cautious on China, and slightly less negative on Europe.","Let's turn to Slide 12. Even with the global market down 5.7% in our second quarter, on a comparable basis, our organic sales were down only 0.3% year-over-year. This is the 540 basis points of market outgrowth I referred to earlier. And importantly, this outgrowth occurred in all of the major light vehicle markets around the globe.","In Europe, our revenue was up 2% compared to the 7% industry production decline in the quarter. In North America, revenue was up 4% versus the 2% industry decline in the quarter. And finally, we did see a 10% decline in our China revenue, but the overall Chinese market was down more than 16% year-over-year.","Underperformance in Korea reduced our global output by a 100 basis points, and our commercial vehicle off-highway and aftermarket businesses were down about 1% year-over-year. Overall, we're pleased that we continued to deliver revenue outgrowth even in this challenging end market environment.","Now, let's look at our adjusted operating income performance, which can be found on Slide 13. Q2 adjusted operating income was $303 million compared to $341 million in the second quarter of 2018. Our adjusted operating margin was 11.9%, down from 12.7% last year. On a comparable basis, adjusted operating income dropped $23 million on $7 million of lower sales. The $22 million shortfall compared to our long term 20% decrimental margins can be explained primarily by our supply chain cost reductions falling short of our target due impart to the year-over-year impact of tariffs and some of insolvency issues in Europe.","In addition, we incurred costs in the quarter related to new business launches scheduled for later in the year. Adjusted earnings per share was $1 for the quarter, slightly below the midpoint of our second quarter guidance. Even though the result was within our EPS guidance range, we are disappointed in this result as we anticipated managing the decrimental margin better. And delivering bottom line remains closer to the top end of our guidance.","In addition, our effective tax rate came in a couple percentage points higher than planned, which reduced adjusted EPS $0.02 in the quarter. We are proud of the fact that we delivered a strong cash flow result for the quarter. In the second quarter, we generated $300 million of free cash flow, significantly stronger than the $161 million we delivered in the same quarter a year ago. As you know, cash flow has become an important focus of the company over the last couple of years as we drive toward generating $1 billion in annual free cash flow starting in 2023.","Now, let's take a closer look at our operating segments on Slide 14. Engine segment sales were $1.569 billion in the quarter. On a comparable basis, sales for the engine segment declined only 0.4%, or $7 million despite lower industry wide production. Growth in North America and Europe for our engine business offset by the impact of the weaker China end market.","Adjusted EBIT was $249 million for the engine segment or 15.9% of sales. On a comparable basis, the engine segment's adjusted EBIT was down $19 million on $7 million of lower sales. This weak decremental margin performance was driven primarily by the decline in sales and by supply chain cost performance not offsetting normal decreases in customer pricing. This is impart due to the costs arising from the year-over-year impact of tariffs and costs related to supplier bankruptcies.","Drivetrain segment sales were $998 million in the quarter. On a comparable basis, sales for the Drivetrain segment increased 0.2% year-over-year. Also, meaningfully outperforming the market as growth in North America offset revenue declines in Europe. Adjusted EBITDA was $102 million for Drivetrain or 10.2% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Drivetrain segment's adjusted EBIT was down $10 million on $2 million of higher sales. The decline was driven by higher R&D spending and launch related costs, primarily in China.","Now I'd like to discuss our full year and third quarter 2019 guidance, which is on Slide 15. Our guidance is based on the end market assumptions I discussed earlier with global production down 3.5% to 5%. Despite that, we expect organic revenue to be in the range of down only 2.5% to roughly flat. That's because we continue to expect to drive significant market outgrowth of 250 basis points to 350 basis points for the full year. We're ahead of that march through the first six months, but we do expect lower outgrowth in the third quarter as a result of the impact of lower launch volumes in China and negative mix in Europe.","With these organic growth assumptions, we now expect total revenue to be in the range of $9.94 billion to $10.18 billion. That means we reduced the top end of our revenue outlook by 200 basis points. Three quarters of this reduction is the result of the lowering the high end of our market production assumptions, while the balance is driven by the lower backlog that we now expect as a result of those end markets now being lower than before in that high end scenario. This lower backlog translates to a decline of a little more than $50 million in revenue from our prior guidance.","Our adjusted operating income margin is now expected to be 11.4% to 11.8% versus 12.3% in 2018. The 40 basis point to 50 basis point decline in our margin outlook relative to our prior guidance reflects weaker cost absorption to continue production volatility and lower than expected revenue in the second half of 2019, weaker supply chain performance stemming in large part from the continued financial challenges in the supply base and weaker year-to-date margin performance than we were expecting.","Full year adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.75 to $4 per diluted share. The decline in the bottom end of the range primarily reflects the weaker margin outlook. In addition, our run rate effective tax rate is now expected to be around 27% for the full year versus our prior guidance of 26%. That has an impact of almost $0.06 on our adjusted EPS guidance range. And finally, we are now targeting free cash flow of $525 million to $575 million, which is down $25 million from our prior guidance. Lower earnings are being partially offset by a reduction in working capital.","That's our full year outlook. Now let's touch on the third quarter outlook starting with sales. We expect organic sales to be in the range of down 1.5% to up 1.5%, which would yield sales of $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion. These expected third quarter organic growth rates are roughly in line with our market forecast, which implies little to no market outgrowth in the third quarter. That's being driven by lower overall volumes on new programs in China and negative mix in Europe.","Importantly, however, we expect this lack of outgrowth to be a one quarter phenomenon as we see the fourth quarter likely to return to our more recent levels of outgrowth. And that keeps us on track for the full year outgrowth of $250 basis points to 350 basis points that we've highlighted.","Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.83 to $0.90 per diluted share in the third quarter. On a year-over-year basis, earnings are expected to be negatively impacted by continued challenges with supply chain cost performance, inefficiencies related to lower launch volumes than planned and higher R&D costs as we continue to invest in electrification related programs within our Drivetrain segment.","Let me wrap up by summarizing how I think about the second quarter results. We were able to deliver 11.9% adjusted operating margin, a $1 of adjusted EPS, which was within our guidance range and $300 million of free cash flow while also driving more than 500 basis points of market outgrowth. And we did all of that in a very challenging end market. But from a financial performance perspective, we're not satisfied.","Our decrementals have been higher than we expected in organization. We will take the necessary actions to get our decrementals back to target, because we fully intend to maintain our company's historically strong margin profile. And in addition, we remain committed to executing against our long range plans in delivering on our long range financial objectives around revenue outgrowth, margin performance and free cash flow generation, even while we manage through a very difficult near term market environment that we expect to continue for the remainder of 2019 and likely into 2020.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat.","Patrick Nowlan","Thank you, Kevin. Sharon, we're ready to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] and your first question comes from Emmanuel Rosner of Deutsche Bank. ","Emmanuel Rosner","So first question is around your full year guidance, or assumptions on the revenues that you really just trimming the high end, but obviously, a fairly large cut through the margin outlook. Can you just go back over why does this modest decrease in the revenue guidance resulted in such a large negative impact on the guided margins? And in particular, I will be interested in any more detail you can provide on some of these comments around supply bankruptcies that you made during the quarter, maybe any quantification?","Fred Lissalde","Emanuel, let me start with the market. So we see the full year market down 2.5% to down 5%, which is a change from the down 2% to 5% that had back two quarters ago. Now, it's not the same minus 5%. China is down more and Europe we're a little bit more confident that the prior guide from a market perspective. So we want to share realistic outlook, especially in China and in Europe. ","From a margin perspective, the first and foremost impact versus our prior guide is coming from our supply base. And Kevin will give you more detail I guess in future questions. But overall this is what's happening in markets and in margins.","Kevin Inda","And maybe I'll follow up on that. I mean overall if you think about the 25% drop, I want to just speak to that in the low end of guidance in particular. The $0.05 of that really relates to the tax rate change going up 1 percentage point. So if I put that aside, I'd say the other $0.20 is really coming from operational performance not hitting our objectives. And there's really three items that are driving that. The first as I say, our second quarter came in weaker than we were anticipating. We expected to deliver at the top end of our guidance, and we missed that top end by about $10 million on a pretax basis.","The second thing I would say is that with the volatility in the global markets and some of the markets coming down more quickly, just as Fred spoke to, we're seeing decrementals coming in closer to 30% right now than the 20% that we target overtime. And then the final thing with what you touched on, the supply cost performance coming in worse than anticipated. And that's due to the continuing impact of some of the insolvencies that we're seeing and frankly just the general macro environment making it more challenging to achieve cost reductions in the supply base. Those are the three items that are causing us to take the guide down.","Emmanuel Rosner","Just a quick thought on this, and then I have a separate second question. But can give more detail on those insolvencies? Obviously, it seems to be something that you're speaking about more now than before, the second quarter margins were okay. Obviously, the second half is much weaker than we expected. And any level of quantification you can give around what is this used to being for the full year in terms of incremental costs from that?","A - Fred Lissalde","Emmanuel, we don't see more impact from bankruptcies. We're managing it. We've been managing it and we've been managing it -- we will managing it. As Kevin alluded to, it's more than market situation that is putting the supply base under pressure.","Emmanuel Rosner","And then now maybe looking forward a little bit, so I think two of the trends that you're highlighting is taking basically more of the satisfactions to improve the cost base in light of this market and then obviously, managing these insolvencies. How should we think about that should as we look forward? How quickly can some of these actions show some impact on margins? And should we assume additional weakness from those insolvencies in 2020?","Fred Lissalde","So in the prior call, we've announced some restructuring that we're essentially SG&A focused. Now, the more aggressive look is going to be around COGS and manufacturing costs. And so we know what to do, we know how to do it and we're just managing through it.","Emmanuel Rosner","And timing?","Fred Lissalde","Timing for the -- I think in the next quarter or two, we're going to give you update.","Operator","Next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. ","Joseph Spak","First question is just if we look, if we compare your revision to the global production versus the revision to your organic growth, it's a little bit steeper for you. It looks like you maybe took down the backlog you expect to come on a little bit this year. Can you just talk about what's driving that? Is it slower ramp ups on some of the programs that were expected to launch perhaps in China? And how do we think about the impact to profitability as you capacitize for certain level of ramp, and that seems might be coming in a little bit softer?","Fred Lissalde","So from a backlog perspective, the major impact that we have is, I would say, some of the program delayed and also a program lower volume went down, and it's essentially in China. The top end of the guide -- the top end of the backlog is down about $50 million and the lower end is unchanged, if that gives you the color that you need, Joe.","Joseph Spak","And then how much is that, how much is the like lower absorption on that is driving the margins in the back half?","Kevin Inda","I mean, that has an impact on the way we're decrementing right now. As we're seeing the volatility in the markets, and some markets like China coming down more quickly than we anticipated, it's causing us to decrement more like the 30% rate as opposed to our target of 20%. And that some of the impact we're seeing as we head to the back half of the year.","Joseph Spak","And then I just want to circle back to this supplier cost reductions act keeping pace. I understand there's an unusual or extraordinary situation maybe with some of the bankruptcies. But is there anything more there? Like did you sign up for certain level of efficiencies and you're expecting to get that and you're not? I guess what I'm trying to understand is the relationship between what you signed up from your customers and then what you expect from your supply basis? Seems like there is a bigger disconnect now.","Kevin Inda","I mean, as I look at the three things that are really impacting us from a supplier cost performance perspective. The first is we have had the impact of year-over-year tariffs. So that's something that's been a headwind year-over-year. The second item is the supplier insolvencies that we talked about, which has provided some headwind to our cost structure this year that we haven't been able to offset. And the third is that general macro environment, which is making it more challenging to execute on cost reduction strategies in the supply base. So, it's really a combination of those three things that's impacting us and causing us to fall short of offsetting normal customer price downs.","Joseph Spak","And those customer price downs are in steady, or has there been a change there?","Kevin Inda","They're relatively consistent. I mean, we haven't seen a significant change in terms of our annual customer price downs. They tend to be consistent with what we've seen in the last couple of years.","Operator","Next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America.","Aileen Smith ","This is Aileen Smith on for John. Following up on Joe's question earlier around the backlog and the slight revision there for 2019 if possible within that full year backlog estimate. Could you remind us what your realization was relative to expectations in the first half of the year? And maybe where that stacks up versus the implied realization on the backlog in the back half of the year?","Kevin Inda","In terms of our market outgrowth in the first half of the year, is that your question?","Aileen Smith ","Yes. ","Kevin Inda","I think in the first quarter, we reported that we had delivered about 190 basis points of market outgrowth. And then in the second quarter here, we delivered 540 basis points. And as we look ahead to the third quarter, we're expecting it to be roughly a little bit flat to up a little bit favorable from an outgrowth. And in the fourth quarter returning to some of the higher levels we've seen relative to where we were in the first half of the year. So all that then gets us to the 250 to 350 basis points of outperformance.","Aileen Smith ","So is it fair to say that perhaps 1Q and then specifically 3Q as you looked at your backlog at the beginning of the year, those are the two quarters where there's some relative weakness on backlog roll on versus expectation. Is that fair?","Fred Lissalde","I would say looking at the backlog quarter-over-quarter is really something that is very granular. I think we should -- one should look at the backlog year-over-year. Last year, we had outgrowth of 600 plus basis point, this year we'll be at 250 to 350 our long term target. And we said on average it's on average, its 500 basis points above market. But looking at it quarter-over-quarter with the - now the different program launches and stuff like this is really, really something that is difficult.","Aileen Smith","And I'm not going to ask any questions around the 2020 backlog specifically, but just to give us a frame of reference as to some of the sensitivity on those numbers. Can you remind us what your underlying volume assumptions were through 2021 when you set your backlog estimates, your three year backlog estimates at the beginning of the year?","Fred Lissalde","The underlying market assumption is overall 1% growth year-over-year and flat on commercial vehicle. And I suggest that maybe you can take follow up on that offline.","Aileen Smith","And then one last question. The cost restructuring plan that you outlined in 1Q, that was intended to help support investment in future technology. Did you get any of the benefit of some of those actions in the second quarter? Or is this more likely a 2020 story, which explains some of the pressure on Drivetrain margin with higher R&D and launch costs?","Kevin Inda","What we alluded to last quarter was intended to do two things. One, to help fund some of the incremental R&D costs that we're expecting. And second was to sustain our strong margin profile. We expect to get the full run rate delivery of that by the time we exit 2020. I will say though that there are some cost performance actions that are taking in the back half of the year that's helping our incrementals as we get into the fourth quarter, but in a small way. The bigger impact is in '20.","Operator","Next question comes from David Leiker with Baird.","David Leiker","I just want to dig through a little bit on China. You're talking about down 10% to 14% for the year. That 14% decline number is higher than where a lot of the past third party people are, just curious of your thoughts. Is that putting a little bit of a cushion in there? Or is that what you're hearing from the market of where your customers are expecting things to be?","Fred Lissalde","So, Dave at the midpoint of our guide, we are at minus 12% for the full year and actually about minus 8% in Q3, close to minus 11% in Q4. This is what we see. And you've seen also some lower pull from electric vehicle from an electric vehicle segment in China this quarter, or let's say in Q2. So this is what we see and we want to share that realistic outlook. This is our best guess. And I agree it might be lower than some third -- out of the third parties, but we want to share what we think.","Q - David Leiker","And then just one change subjects here for a bit on Romeo. you give a little bit of detail in terms of what that business is today. I'm sure there are multiple options in term that you could partner with why did you choose them and what customer base do they have? Just if you'd flesh that out a little bit would be great. Thanks.","Fred Lissalde","So, we -- as you know, technology drives whatever we do on M&A and also I think analyzed every place in the battery management system, the thermal management system in the battery. And also their flexibility on what type of sales to use, we found that Romeo Power was the best one. And that's why we chose them. They are in production with some low volume application commercial vehicle application. And the joint venture is very simple. And I think joint venture has to be very simple. The focus on product development, and we focused on customer intimacy and manufacturing at scale and globally. And we are in talks with a few customers around the world for different types of applications.","Operator","And your next question comes from David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.","David Tamberrino","Yes, let's just stick with Romeo. Is that something that your customers were asking you to do? I mean is this something that you wanted to do in order to provide a full solution? What was the internal evolution of thinking of going on and adding this to your portfolio?","Fred Lissalde","You've heard us talk about the fact that we want to enhance our system focus in electric vehicle and hybrid vehicle. And if you look at all the components that we are making in the slate that shows the components in blue, there was one missing piece is that we wanted to ask to be having products from grid two wheel. And with having all those products, we felt that we can add value to customers from the system understanding, potentially from the product integration path. And so we proactively decided to go into this field.","And I think it is also an element where we think in addition to the system understanding and expertise that we can still get between the cell makers that do battery packs and battery thermal management and some of the OEs that do that too, and we feel good about that.","Q - David Tamberrino","And then as a follow up, there's been some reports of incremental competition within the turbo charger market. Is that impacting the margin profile on new business that you're quoting, or you're not seeing any impact in the marketplace?","Fred Lissalde","So on the turbo market, the new program pricing are challenged. And this is coming from competitive dynamic that is currently existing. We are absolutely focused on our financial discipline. We're focused in getting the best products in the hands of our customers. But they are programs that we're not going to chase.","Operator","Next question comes from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research.","Rod Lache","Just hoping you could help me get my head around something here. So the midpoint of your full year EBIT guidance came down by $55 million on an $81 million revision to revenue, if I use the midpoint of revenue guidance. So it looks like the bigger change to your expectations were on the cost side. And if I do a simple bridge, the first half decremental margin on the revenue decline was 23%. But if I do the same math on the second half, it's 38%. And maybe you can just elaborate a little bit more on, it seems like this is a cost thing. And is it costs coming into the platform, or is it the inability to take costs out due to some of the factors you're describing here with the Tier 2s?","A - Kevin Inda","Rob, this is Kevin. I'll answer that. I think it's predominantly what we're seeing on the cost side in a few different ways. And I'll take it in the three buckets. I think the $55 million that you quoted is a good way to think about it. The first bucket I'd say is we expected to deliver better performance in the second quarter from a decremental perspective, and we didn't deliver on that. Some of the reason because of the some of the supply chain performance. That was about $10 million of that $55 million as you think about it that we expected to be at the upper end of our guidance range.","Second is because of all the volatility that we're seeing in the markets, especially with some of the markets coming down in a more accelerated way, we are decrementing at the moment closer to 30% than 20%. 20%, which is our target and will remain our target means that we have to take some costs out to be able to achieve that. But when the markets are moving this quickly, it takes a little bit more time for us to execute. And so we're seeing decrimentals at that 30% level. And you can do the math and see how big an impact that is ballpark, call it, $25 million on a full year basis.","And then the final thing is really the supplier cost performance coming in worse than anticipated for the reasons that we talked about earlier. And that's really the bridge for that 55 million or so that you've pointed to. When you look at the first half versus the second half, the one other thing I think you need to keep in mind as you do a year-over-year causal is that we do anticipate our R&D expense being higher in the second half of the year than the first half based on what we're planning right now.","Rod Lache","Okay, that might be a big factor there. And in terms of the supplier issues. How wide spread is this within Europe? And if there were to be a downturn in this market, should we interpret this is something that posses an additional risk with the downside sensitivity be greater?","Fred Lissalde","So, the bankruptcies are essentially centered in Europe. But the supplier distress, I would say from the current microenvironment and volatility that one see, is varied at -- is at different degrees, but I would say it's global.","Rod Lache","And just lastly you alluded to additional restructuring. Are you seeking, at this point, to mitigate additional pressures that you see coming into 2020 and trying to get ahead of that? Or are you primarily looking to restore to your current -- to your margin targets based on the current level of production?","Fred Lissalde","We're trying to be proactive and head of the curve.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays.","Q - Brian Johnson","Yes. Just try to get to a couple of questions that might be left. In terms of the backlog, how comfortable are you with the 4Q launch cadence, especially, well, both in China given the micro pressures there and then in Europe, given the uncertain outlook for CO2 compliance?","Fred Lissalde","What we see right now is that launches are on time. We don't see program cancellation. We see very rare program delays. But what we see is that when it launches, it launches at lower volume. That's the key impact of the backlog shift.","Brian Johnson","And then second, as we start looking at 2020, 2021 EU CO2 compliance. Can you help us balance out? On the one hand, it would seem to drive additional take rates across your product lines and install rates, and how you're factoring that in. On the other hand, it's not lost on investors that the European other market, particularly in the mass market is the disaster from the OEM point of view and only going to get worse as these mandates come in, which could underscore both pricing pressure and\/or ability to recover costs overruns. So, how do you think about your two to three outlook in light of those trends?","Fred Lissalde","So, this is a question that I'd like to answer later in the year. We're currently going through the process of getting our arms around 2020. And with the volatility that w experienced, this is going to take some time. So I'd like to reserve my answer to a little point in time in the year.","Operator","Next question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore.","Chris McNally","I think I have a similar question to Brian, so I might counter that you said you could address it later. I think what we're all trying to figure out and my colleague has been running this for some time. Is it fair to say that BorgWarner's sitting here in the middle of the year is very conscious that there is probably a disconnect, first what you see as the gap in 2020 and 2021, fuel efficiency in Europe to meet regulations need to grow up by 20% to 25% in the next 12 to 18 months. And that you have to do something to gain scenario for that, because OEMs are not really admitting to the problem. There's definitely going to be some repercussions. I think is that something that you recognize right now, or are we on the sales side seeing numbers that maybe are skewed and we're missing something in our analysis?","Fred Lissalde","We're not going to speak for our customers. But what I can tell you is that for every product that we do that balancing that enhances fuel efficiency and reduce emission, we see a strong pull. And everything we can do to add capacity and to push production lies to deliver more in Europe to help our customers, we'll do.","Chris McNally","So you are starting to at least consider a scenario where as our customers come to you with a need for higher adoption rates of fuel efficient products, whether that's ICE or on the electrification side?","Fred Lissalde","We're saying it and it's good for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Levy with Credit Suisse.","Dan Levy","Just following up on this line of questions, I assume that there is a fairly fluid discussion between yourself and the OEMs on what they're trying to achieve. So could you just give us a sense, the latest thing that you're hearing, OEMs have a number of options of meeting these targets, whether it's just more beds and pay TVs, or to enhance the internal combustion engines or pay the credit fund. Where does the enhanced internal combustion engine fit in on this? And as it relates to yourselves, I mean your internal combustion engine portfolio is obviously mature, it's been around for a while, the hybrid and BEV piece, this is newer. Where are you in terms of capacity on ICE versus the hybrid and that piece, and ability to meet incremental demand on both sides?","Fred Lissalde","So first again, we're not going to speak to our customers. But since we are pretty relevant in the propulsion area and we have a breadth of product that cuts across combustion and within electric, and that's what we do right. We have discussion at the highest level at customers and each customers have different options to meet future regulatory obligations either 2020 and 2025, or 2030, they have different options. And each customers are going to take potentially different path and different options depending on what their fees, depending on what they used to do. And for us we position ourselves as a system supplier, able to supply and support them in anything they want to do.","So, it's not going to be a one sides fits all. You're we\u2019re going to see a lot of different customers moving in lot of different strategies technologies and products strategies. And whatever they do, they can do it BorgWarner. From a combustion product standpoint, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, customers are still wanting to bring in their portfolio innovative solution that makes their engine and transmission leaner and more efficient. So we see that pull also.","Dan Levy","And then just one more, I wanted to just follow up on China. Obviously, a very challenging market environment and you think you're still able to maintain efforts in the second quarter. But if I just contrast your current China profile versus the last couple of years where you were experiencing very significant and robust outgrowth, I think in order of magnitude 20 points to 30 points, just very robust outgrowth. Is there something that's happening in terms of the product mix set shifting? Or is it now that you're emphasizing more hybrids and electrification at that uptake, is maybe a little slower than -- I think previously there is more DCT. So just trying to understand the shift in the China growth?","Fred Lissalde","So, two things I want to try to give you some color then first of all, year-after-year, our base revenue becoming higher, so the outgrowth in percents is based on the higher revenue. What you see in China also is that as I alluded to before the volumes of the products that are being launched are lower than that what we expected in the past because of the macro environment and the customer confidence and other changes in this market. You see ups and downs on take rate on battery electric vehicle and that impacts us quite a bit.","Operator","Your next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer.","Noah Kaye","Maybe just a quick one on Romeo. I think you explained your strategic rationale. Obviously, this is a large AFP or content for vehicle item. Can you talk a little bit about the backlog that you're seeing where the coating activity, just for us to try to understand what the growth trajectory could look like for BorgWarner to the battery system supplier?","Fred Lissalde","No, it's still very early days for the JV. We're getting everything ready. We have customer pool. We are in coating phases. In any case, between now when we quote and when we launch, most probably won't have any significant impact in our three year backlog.","Noah Kaye","And then I understand, I mean you're really targeting niche volume productions, tens of thousands. Is that correct?","Fred Lissalde","That is correct. ","Noah Kaye","And then just on the -- just to go back to\u2026","Fred Lissalde","That is correct initially\u2026","Noah Kaye","So then just to go back to some of the breakdowns with the supplier bankruptcies. I guess, obviously, we've gone through this before in a much more severe way globally in decades past. I guess what does surprised you at all about what's happening now in that supply base, and what mitigating actions are you taking?","Fred Lissalde","So I would say, if there is a surprise it's how many suppliers are impacted. As I mentioned before, it's essentially Europe. And in Europe you've seen an impact on the supply base of the diesel drop, which is not significant for us but for some of our supplies it is significant. And we have to find a way to manage these costs. We have to find a way to get through those tough times. And just we know how to do it, we've done it before and we're doing it. It's just the magnitude and the number of them that if there was a surprise that would be the surprise.","Operator","Next question comes from Armintas Sinkevicius with Morgan Stanley.","Armintas Sinkevicius","Good morning, thank you for taking the question. Presumably this is already incorporated into the guide around European production. But maybe you could give us some color around how your customers are thinking about RDE coming up here in a few months?","Fred Lissalde","So I think we see the impact of RDE coming in a few months. And so right now our put in Europe is that it's going to be flat second half of prior year at the midpoint of our guidance from a market perspective. I think it's a bit early to talk about the impact of RDE, at least at our level.","Armintas Sinkevicius","And then the other question is just more broadly we're seeing in partnerships with BMW and Jaguar Land Rover around the electric drive unit. Volkswagen is talking about 30% less employees for an electric vehicle versus an internal combustion engine. Just as we gravitate towards that world. How do you think about the potential risks of in-sourcing and how do you position yourself?","Fred Lissalde","So we've always been in products that have potentials of in-sourcing. And from a battery electric vehicle standpoint motor and drive motor being a good proxy, our hypothesis is that the available market is going to be 50% of the total market, i.e. 50% of those motors could be in-sourced. And again it's not going to be one size fits all, it's not going to be, we think, one customer is doing it all in-house, some customers are not going to do it, some customers are going to do some and outsource some. And even if customers do, let's take motor as a proxy in-house, they will still need components. And they will still need efficient motors and we are here to support them also in this. So for us, supplying systems is certainly a target understanding system is certainly core, but we are absolutely supportive in selling components too.","Operator","We have time for one final question, and that question comes from Colin Langan with UBS.","Colin Langan","When I look at the Q3 guidance, it seems to imply a pretty good bound in margin. I mean, how should we think about margin cadence? So it just seems like Q3 looked little rough based on their earnings guide. And then it has to pick up a big step in Q4. Is that the case and why the sequential decline here?","Kevin Inda","Colin, this is Kevin. From a sequential perspective, the reason we're seeing the step down is first and foremost, revenue stepping down $50 million to $150 million in our guidance. And with the quick moves we're seeing to the downside and some of the revenue, we're decrementing it closer to 30%. So that's a big piece of the equation. In addition to that, we are seeing a sequential step up in our R&D expense as we head into the third quarter. Some of what we anticipated in the second quarter slipped into the third quarter, and so that's going to be north of $5 million, in the $5 million to $10 million range sequentially in Q3.","Colin Langan","And so you should expect though as to jump back up in Q4 get full year to Q4. What makes Q4 so strong?","Kevin Inda","Well, Q4, our revenue takes back up you can see that in our guide. The Q3 is the low point. So we do expect to convert on the incremental revenue sequentially. When we look at the back half of the year, there is a couple of things that we normally expect. One is that we do tend generate certain types of prototype income, or government grants in a modest way that impact the quarter. We're also expecting to see some of the cost performance that we talked about last quarter starting to kick-in in our Q4 results as well. But again a big piece of that is really coming from the conversion on incremental revenue.","Colin Langan","And just lastly just to clarify prior comments about pricing in turbo. When we're thinking about that impact in the market that how would hit your backlog when it comes to us, if it's not a factor in the margin performance currently?","Fred Lissalde","It would most probably be passed to backlog, because this is something that we are quoting now. And so team would be -- would not be impacting the backlog, would be impacting the backlog very marginally.","Colin Langan","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Fred Lissalde","Thank you, Colin.","Patrick Nowlan","With that, I'd like to thank you all for your good questions.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.","I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Nolan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Nolan, you may begin your conference.","Patrick Nolan - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you, Sharon. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. We issued our earnings release at 6:30 AM Eastern Time. It's posted on our website, borgwarner.com, on our homepage and on our Investor Relations homepage. There will be a replay of today's call available through May 11th. The dial-in for that call is 855-859-2056, and the conference ID is 49068373. Or you can listen to the replay on our website.","With regard to our Investor Relations calendar, we'll be attending several conferences between now and our next earnings release. Please see the Events section of our Investor Relations homepage for a full list.","Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today.","Now back to today's call. First, James Verrier, our President and CEO, will comment on the industry, provide a high-level overview of our Q1 results as well as discuss some of our recent product wins. Then Ron Hundzinski, our CFO, will discuss the details of our results as well as our guidance.","Please note that we posted an earnings call presentation to the IR page of our website. You'll find the link in the Events and Presentations section below the notice for this call. We encourage you to follow along through these slides during our discussion.","With that, I'll turn it over to James.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you, Patrick and good day and welcome to everybody. Thank you for joining our call. As Pat said, Ron and I are really pleased to share our results from first quarter 2017 and update you on how we're progressing towards delivering our 2017 targets.","So I'm going to start by sharing a few thoughts on the macro environment in the industry. And for those of you following along, I'm now going to be on slide five. So, from a macro perspective, we recognize and see \u2013 there is instability out there in many aspects. But I think what's interesting and key for us is in general, the outlook for the auto industry has been good and remains good.","If I talk a little bit about global light vehicle production in Q1, growth was strong. In Europe, light vehicle production rose about 6%. China light vehicle production was up close to 7%, which was well ahead of our expectations as we went into the quarter. And in North America, light vehicle industry production increased low single digits with continued strong mix.","As I start to think about the outlook for the market, let me start light vehicle 2017 calendar year. And I would say we're closely aligned with HIS' view, which is calling for about 2% growth in China. We see Europe up about 1%, and we see North American production down between 1% and 2%.","Now if you look at that on a weighted basis from a BorgWarner perspective, that would imply global production growth of slightly less than 1% for us. A word about commercial vehicle where we are seeing signs of improvement; in North America, we see orders and medium-duty sales improving. And as we look towards China and Europe, the outlook has improved, and we think it's going to be stronger. So, it's a good environment, as I mentioned earlier. But as ever, you would always keep your eye on things that could go against us a little. So a couple of things, one is the North American cycle itself. And we recognize that we're kind of towards the higher levels. We've seen a little bit of modest softening in North America schedules since the beginning of the year, and we'll continue to monitor and watch inventory level.","Diesel gas mix in Europe shifted in Q1. And as we look at it, diesel share declined about 360 bps year-over-year in Q1. And we expect this diesel-gas mix to shift throughout the end of the decade. The really good news for us though is we're offsetting that in the near term. And I'm going to talk a little bit more about diesel-gas mix in the next few slides.","I'd say the other area we keep paying a lot of attention to is China. We're still expecting modest industry growth in 2017. But I think more importantly for us, our growth over the market remains very strong due to increasing share and content per vehicle. So, let me wrap all of this up. I want to be really clear. We're confident in our outgrowth of the market in 2017 based on the continued strong demands for our products.","Let me make a couple of comments in regards to the regulatory and technology area. We still see a continued strong drive around fuel economy and emissions regulations and the pull for advanced propulsion technology continues to be strong. I would say the activity is accelerating particularly around gas and hybrid vehicles and also in electric vehicles. And for us as a company, our transition to the increased electrification continues.","As I look at our Q1 new business bookings, it was strong. It continued to show additional awards with a range of customers, very balanced regionally and across all propulsion system architectures. And for those of you that may be keeping track, we'd shared that we had about mid-20s awards for hybrids and electric platforms at year-end, and we've added a couple more to that during Q1. And we plan to provide a more detailed update around this at our Analyst Day in August.","So as I mentioned earlier, diesel-gas mix is kind of a key topic, and we do get a number of questions on this. So I'd like to give you some additional color around this, and I'm on slide number six at this stage. So as we started out this year, we had assumed 100 bps to 200 bps annually shift in Western Europe diesel-gas mix through the end of the decade. And as you look at the chart on the screen there, you will see that Q1, that mix shifted more and a little faster than we'd anticipated.","So, let me give you a little bit of a perspective on what does that really mean for BorgWarner. One of the best ways to think about this is, today, the net revenue impact for BorgWarner with 100 bps shift from diesel to gas mix is about a $20 million to $25 million annual number. If you think of that in the context of a $9 billion company, that's very manageable for us.","And in addition to that, by the end of our backlog period, we expect that gap will close significantly as our content per vehicle continues to increase on gas-powered vehicles. So our view is the mix shift is a minor issue for us now, and over the midterm, it becomes negligible.","If you take a look at slide seven, here's a good way to think about the shift from diesel to gas impacts our business. There's three fundamental products that are diesel oriented. I'll start with turbo. So in Western Europe, pretty much all diesel vehicles are turbocharged 100%. Gas, it's about 75% to 80% and increasing, and pricing is pretty much similar. So for us, as the gasoline turbo penetration grows, this becomes a very negligible issue.","The second product line light vehicle diesel versus EGR product line; and what we're seeing there is as transition moves to gasoline vehicles, there will be more and more gasoline EGR content on those vehicles. The third area is glow plugs, which are diesel-centric products, and they're going to be offset by a strong growth in variable cam timing on the gasoline \u2013 advanced gasoline engines. So again for us, the revenue impact is neutralized by the end of the backlog as we gain content on gasoline-powered vehicles.","Let me turn now to slide eight and give you a little bit of a financial recap for us. And Ron, as Pat said earlier, will provide a lot more detail on this following myself. So as I look at the first quarter for BorgWarner, I have to say I was very, very pleased, particularly around our growth.","Our growth came in well above the guidance, $2.4 billion of sales in the quarter, which is a record for us. That's up 12.8% organically when we exclude FX and REMY. And this compares to our end market growth exposure, which was about 4.5%, so strong out-performance.","Regionally as we'd expected, we did get strong growth in China, strong growth in North America and the European growth was just modestly ahead of our industry growth. This light vehicle growth was also supplemented by positive revenue trends in commercial vehicle, particularly off-road.","These all helped us deliver EPS of $0.91 excluding non-comparables, which I think is very strong performance, and an operating margin again at 12.2%. And again, Ron will provide a little more color on that.","If I look at it from a segment perspective, the most powerful thing for me as I looked at our Q1 performance was the growth across all of our products. It was really incredible. All of our product lines were growing at a very strong rate. That helped us deliver engine sales of $1.5 billion. So that's growth of just over 9.5% organically, very strong. And that again is in light of the diesel mix shift that I explained earlier. We've still got that very strong top line growth.","Drivetrain \u2013 Drivetrain sales at $925 million, that's up almost 19% organically. So you could imagine we saw a growth across almost every aspect of Drivetrain business. We had strong all-wheel drive growth, strong DCT growth and strong transmission growth in most regions of the world, so a super quarter for growth in Drivetrain.","Let me give a little bit of a view on our outlook for 2017. So revenue and operating margin outlook is unchanged from the guidance we provided last quarter. That has us landing with organic growth of mid 3.5% to 6% year-over-year. And again, that's in a market that's growing less than 1%.","Our consolidated operating income margin is expected to expand 40 basis points to 50 basis points and our EPS guidance range is $3.50 to $3.60 per diluted share. That's up from our prior guidance due to favorable taxes, which Ron will talk you through in a few moments.","I do want to talk a little bit about growth highlights. And we had a number in the quarter, and I'm just going to dwell on a couple of them for you, and you can see that on slide 9. DCT clutch and control module for ChangAn was a really big win for us. That's ChangAn's first self developed DCT transmission and we will be providing a lot of content there. Also, good to see us supplying our HY-VO chain technology on hybrid and plug-in hybrid technology, you can see that. So, this is a snapshot of just four leading-edge technologies that are providing growth. And again, the key message I wanted to share with you is it continues to be across the balance of combustion, hybrid, and electric platforms.","We also have another couple of announcements that will be coming out in the next couple of weeks that I think will also give you a lot of excitement in terms of our bookings for new business. So the key message here, our balanced approach around propulsion systems for combustion, hybrid and electric is strong. We're winning and its driving long-term growth for us.","So let me summarize before I turn over to Ron. Q1 was a really strong top line quarter for us. And again, I'm really pleased that we're seeing strong growth across all of our major businesses. From an operating perspective, I think the business is absolutely operating in line with our expectations, which is really good to see. And with that, we feel very comfortable about our ability to execute toward the high-end of our growth expectations for the year. We believe the company's positioned to deliver mid-to-high single-digit growth over the long term. In a nutshell, the future is very bright for BorgWarner, both in the short term and in the long term.","And with that now, let me turn it over the Ron to provide some more detail.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you, James and good day, everyone. Before I review the financial details, I would like to provide you some of the highlights as I see them for the quarter. As James said, I think the first one is outstanding growth, and it significantly was above our guidance for the quarter. And I will even give you more color on that a little bit later. Our operating performance was as expected for us for the quarter. And most importantly, the quarter positions us stronger towards our full year guidance. So as Pat mentioned, I will be referring to supplemental financial slide deck that is posted on our IR website, and I do encourage you to follow along.","First, I'd like to focus your attention on slide 11. Throughout the presentation, I will highlight certain non-U.S. GAAP measures to provide a clear picture of how the core business performed and for comparisons with prior periods. Specifically, we will be excluding the impact of FX, net M&A of the Remy light vehicle aftermarket divestiture and other non-comparable items from certain U.S. GAAP measures. When you hear me say on a comparable basis, that means excluding everything I just mentioned; when you hear me say on a reported basis, that means U.S. GAAP.","So now let's turn to slide 12. On a reported basis, sales were up 1.6%. On a comparable basis, our organic sales were up 12.8%. This was approximately 600 basis points ahead of the high-end of our guidance. Our weighted average industry production was about 4.5%. Our guide was set at 0.5%. So we saw 400 basis points tailwind from production.","Our expectation for China growth was low double digits. Our growth came in at 29%, resulting in about 150 basis points of tailwind. Commercial vehicle was a benefit as well, contributing more than 100 basis points of tailwind. The primary headwind versus our expectations was the diesel-gas mix in Western Europe.","Before I move on to operating profit, I would like to discuss our gross profit and SG&A line items. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 21.5% in the quarter, which is up 100 basis points from last year, great performance. On a reported basis, SG&A was 9.1% of sales. R&D spending, which is included in SG&A, was up to 4% of sales. SG&A was up 80 basis points from a year ago and there's three main reasons for the increase.","First, R&D spending was up 20 basis points from a year ago as we continued to invest for the future. 20 basis points is related to variable stock comp that was not accrued until the fourth quarter of last year. So it was a difficult comp. And there is some 30 basis points as related to various increases in compliance costs, tax planning and other professional fees. And finally, there is a modest headwinds as some Remy costs were reclassified from cost of goods sold to SG&A.","Now, let's look at the year-over-year comparison for operating income, which can be found on slide 13. Q1 operating profit was $293 million or 12.2% of sales compared to $276 million in Q1 of 2016, which was also 12.2% of sales. On an organic basis, operating income was up $25 million on $277 million of higher sales. That gives us an incremental margin of 9% in the quarter, although this was in line with our expectations. So I will discuss incremental margins more after I go through the segment performance numbers.","As you look further down the income statement, equity in affiliate earnings was about $10 million in the quarter, up slightly from last year. Interest expense and finance charges was $18 million in the quarter, down $3 million from last year due to lower debt levels. Excluding $3 million onetime tax adjustment, the provision for income taxes was $83 million for an effective tax rate of 29% for the quarter. We have updated our full year guidance to reflect a full year effective tax rate of 29% versus 32% previously. The reduced tax rate is the result of lower statutory tax rates in Hungary and Japan, along with obtaining a lower tax rate for high tech status for our China facility. Net earnings attributable to non-controlling interest was about $10 million, up $1 million from the first quarter 2016. This line reflects our minority partner share in earnings performance of our Korean and Chinese consolidated joint ventures. Earnings per share on a reported basis was $0.89 per diluted share. On a comparable basis, net earnings were $0.91 per diluted share.","Now, let's take a closer look at operating segments in the quarter beginning on slide 14. Reported Engine segment net sales was $1.495 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for Engine segment on a comparable basis was 9.5% as demand for light vehicle OEM products was supplemented by growth in our commercial vehicle business. Adjusted EBIT was $247 million for the Engine segment or 16.5% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Engine segment's adjusted EBIT was up $16 million on $133 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 12%, which we expect to accelerate later in the year.","Turning to slide 13 and starting from the right. Drivetrain segment net sales were $925 million in the quarter. This does include a reduction of $90 million of sales from the divestiture of the Remy light vehicle aftermarket. Sales growth for the Drivetrain segment on a comparable basis was 18.8%, primarily due to higher all-wheel transmission components and strong DCT growth in China. Adjusted EBIT was $105 million for the Drivetrain segment or 11.3% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Drivetrain segment's adjusted EBIT was up $20 million on $149 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 13%.","Like I said earlier, I'd like to take a moment to discuss incremental margins. Our total company incremental margin for Q1 was 9%, which is below our long-term goal of mid-teens but in line with our Q1 expectations. In order to better understand this, there are a few items we should highlight. First, segment incremental margins. The Engine segment incremental margins were 12% or about $5 million of headwind towards our incremental goal of mid-teens.","Our realignment emission (21:12) products in Europe, which includes the Wahler acquisition, continues to see operational headwinds, but should improve in the second half of the year. Our Drivetrain segment incremental margins were 13%, which was up from 11% in Q4 as we continued to launch DCT plants in China. So, the question is that Engine incremental margins were 12% and Drivetrain were 13%, why is the total company at 9%? In a nutshell, it's corporate and other costs.","So first, if you take a look at the reported segment income statement in the press release, which is on page 6, you will note a $5.3 million charge for the early termination of a lease. In addition, corporate costs incurred and additional stock-based comp I mentioned earlier and various advisory fees and tax and legal planning. Adding back these items would generate approximately 500 basis points in improvement incremental margin, which gets you basically back to the mid-teens growth \u2013 incremental margin.","Now, let's take a look at our balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $60 million of net cash from operating activities in Q1, up $26 million from Q1 of 2016. Q1 is typically our lowest quarter in cash flow generation. Our investments in working capital wraps up the first quarter to match higher levels of business activity compared to the year-end. Capital spending was $131 million for the quarter, which is up $27 million from a year ago. Free cash flow, which we define as net cash from operating activities less capital spending, was a negative $71 million, basically flat from 2016.","Looking at the balance sheet itself, balance sheet debt increased by $76 million, and cash decreased by $85 million compared with the end of 2016. The $161 million increase in net debt was primarily due to the seasonality of increased working capital to support higher level of business. Our net debt to net capital ratio was 35.8% at the end of the first quarter, up slightly from 35% at the end of 2016. And net debt to EBITDA at the end of the quarter was 1.24 times.","Now, I'd like to discuss our 2017 guidance. At the high end, our revenue and margin guidance is unchanged from last quarter. So, let's start with our sales growth guidance for the full year on slide 17.","Backlog pricing and market-related growth are expected to drive 3.5% to 6% organic sales growth. I'd like to note that the net unfavorable market growth\/pricing amount on the slide is negative. Our full year assumption is that our weighted average market growth is slightly less than 1% and price reductions are in line with historic levels. Currency is expected to reduce sales by $310 million or about 350 basis points. Adding all this up and incorporating our Q1 performance, our full year revenue is tracking at the high end of our guidance range.","Next, I'll walk our operating income on slide 18. From a performance perspective, we continued to expect mid-teens incremental margins on our sales growth. Included in this are some tailwinds and headwinds. Tailwinds include continued improvement in Wahler and Remy, offset by expected headwinds from commodity prices and corporate costs. We do expect an inflationary environment in commodities and rising compliance costs. Our consolidated operating income margin is expected to expand by 40 basis points to 50 basis points full year.","To finish up our full year guidance, please turn to slide 19. EPA guidance \u2013 EPS guidance range is now $3.50 to $3.60 per diluted share. The $0.15 increase is primarily driven by the lower tax rate I mentioned earlier. Free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx, is expected to be in the $450 million to $500 million range. Capital spending including tooling is expected to be in the range of $475 million to $525 million.","We expect to continue executing our share repurchase program, targeting $100 million-plus depending on M&A activity. R&D spending as a percentage of sales is expected to be 4% in 2017. The tax rate is now expected to be 29%, down from 32%. Our assumption for the dollar-euro exchange rate is $1.05. As a reminder, every one cent change in the dollar-to-euro exchange rate equates to about $30 million to $35 million of sales.","Our second quarter guidance starts on slide 21. First, sales. Note that Remy light vehicle aftermarket sales divested are $80 million. So the starting point base is $2.25 billion net new business. Pricing and market rate growth are expected to drive organic sales growth of 3% to 6.5%. Currency is expected to reduce sales by 510 basis points. And therefore, 2017 Q2 sales is expected to be $2.24 billion at the midpoint.","From an EPS perspective on slide 22, we expect $0.03 to $0.07 per share from the backlog, market and pricing, with about $0.01 of headwind from corporate and other costs. Foreign currencies are expected to lower earnings by about $0.05 per share in the quarter. And below operating income line items are expected to contribute $0.07 per share from a lower share count and a lower tax rate. On a consolidated basis, we expect earnings of $0.87 to $0.91 per share.","So, let me summarize quarter one. Quarter one was a great start to the year. Comparable sales growth was nearly 13%. And even after subtracting strong industry production, we grew in the high-single digits. The sales growth was seen in all of our products and segments. Although our incremental margins were slightly below our mid-teens goal, they were as we expected, and we anticipate this improvement in the second half of the year on top of it. As we look at 2017 and beyond, we continue to drive intensity around new product development to support the impending electrification trend. There is no question in my mind that that won't drive growth for many years.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat.","Patrick Nolan - BorgWarner, Inc.","Sharon, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Colin Langan with UBS. Please go ahead.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Great. Thanks for taking my question. Why \u2013 and if you're indicating (28:54) the high end of sales guidance is likely, but given your very strong organic growth out of the gate, why not raise sales guidance? I mean, actually, I'm surprised like things are fairly flattish from here on out.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, Colin. This is James. Fair question. First of all, thanks for the comment on a strong Q1. We really did feel good about that strong organic growth. A couple of things to think about. It's only one quarter in, and I think we need to calibrate that. As we alluded to, there are a couple of things that we're paying attention to \u2013 the diesel\/gas mix, the China and North America. So we've got to watch those a little bit.","So I think it's just a prudent thing at this stage to get another quarter under our belt. With that said, as Ron and I both alluded to, we are comfortable that we're certainly trending towards the high end of our guidance. And let's get another quarter under our belt is kind of a key thing, I would say.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And on your comments, you've indicated China was very strong, a big outperformer. What's driving that? And any update on the DCT joint venture in China? Is that finally starting to kick in?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yes. No. Ron explained it. I think it was 29% growth for the first quarter, so well above the market. The really good thing, Colin, was it was pretty much across all of our product offering, we saw that growth in China, so both on the engine side and the Drivetrain side.","I think, from a, let me say, a strategic perspective, we are starting to see the strong acceleration of DCT in China. I know for many of you that have been following us for a while, that's been a little bit long in coming. But we did see a notable uplift in DCT revenue in China, which is a big part. But really it was across the whole product portfolio we saw strong growth in China.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. All right. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a good quarter.","Patrick Nolan - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thanks, Colin.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everybody.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Good morning.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Had a couple of things I wanted to ask. One is just on the backlog, if I add the first quarter and then your forecast for the second quarter, your first half backlog contribution is $350 million, $400 million. Your full year is $410 million to $590 million. So, it looks like 85% of it is happening in the first half. Is that a timing issue? Is the first half taking away from something that you had in the back half? Or is that just conservatism?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yes, Rod. This is James. I'll take a shot at it and then Ron can add as needed. I think the way I look at it at least is we feel good about the backlog. The first quarter is coming in a little bit ahead of what we thought. Second quarter backlog looks pretty good too.","I don't think it's so much of a pulling. I think it's a little bit of a, let's give ourself a little bit more time to see how things play out, frankly speaking, before we would want to readjust the backlog number. There's nothing materially pulling in from a launch perspective, Rod.","It's not a big shift of product mix, launch or anything like that. I think it's just Q1 came in stronger than we'd anticipated. We're digesting that. We want to see how that runs into the second quarter. And then we'll have a better view of what the second half backlog looks like. But no fundamental shift kind of is the point, Rod, in terms of technology, adoption, launch cadence, those types of things.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","The only thing I would add, Rod, is sometimes, you hit on all cylinders and it was one of those quarters where we actually hit on (32:51) cylinders, in the past, we have some positive news and then we have some negative news. This is one of those quarters where everything just, quite frankly, came in positive, right where we hoped it would come in and it did. So, it was a great quarter.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. And then secondly, just given the magnitude of the diesel decline that we're seeing in Europe, it would seem that the European market broadly may actually be seeing a rise in CO2 emissions rather than a decline, just given that CO2 is less for diesel.","So, I'd imagine that they'd be scrambling, your customers would be scrambling for technologies to help offset that. And I was hoping you might be able to give us some kind of a quantification or a sense of what is actually happening, what's the pace of contract awards that you're seeing this year versus maybe last year? Is there anything that we can take away from that vis-\u00e0-vis your growth and as you get out towards \u2013 closer to 2020?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yes, Rod, I'll take a shot at that for you. I think you're right. First of all, we do as we showed in the chart there that the diesel decline has accelerated faster than I think what everybody was anticipating.","So that's moved down that 350 bps in the first quarter versus our expectation of 100 bps or so. We do see that potentially going down further through the rest of the year. So, we're seeing it accelerate a little faster move to gas more a little faster.","It's certainly going to put pressure on 2017 CO2 attainment for sure. What we're seeing from a more, I don't know, medium-term perspective, Rod, I would say it's fair that we are seeing even more increased development activity in contracts around gas, advanced gas particularly, and hybrids and less focus on diesel development.","I don't want to portray that there's not optimization in programs going on for diesel, because there is. But it's fair to say that we've seen an uptick in focus on EV architecture discussions, hybrids and particularly a lot of work around optimizing the advanced gasoline engines. So, hopefully that helps a little bit, Rod. I think where it all ends and settles, we'll have to see how it plays out during the year.","From a Borg perspective, we feel good. We feel well-positioned because we're participating on those hybrid architectures, the gas architectures and obviously EV architectures too. So, more to come, Rod, but I think the key message is, it's accelerating.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. And just lastly on a housekeeping item, can you give us your expectation for raw materials for the year? And what was the dollar headwind from light vehicle diesel and tailwind from commercial vehicle in the quarter?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","I'll talk about the commodity. Commodity headwind was $10 million for the full year. But it was mostly weighted to the first quarter. But, what really happened in the quarter, Rod, is we saw the inflationary environment. And as we said before, roughly 65% is contractually passed through. And then we typically do better than that on negotiations, and what happened is we did better than that. We were able to negotiate more pass-through. So, therefore, you didn't really see any kind of headwind in the quarter in commodity. But, inflationary environment is there, I'd like to point that out.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","(36:29) for the year?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Pardon?","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","What are you expecting for the year in terms of inflation?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","It was $10 million of \u2013 this was the commodity impact-wise, and that includes some corporate, as well, cost in there for the full year, Rod.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's what you're expecting for the full year. So, okay, great, thank you.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Right. You got another question on commercial vehicle, what was your...","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. So can you quantify the commercial vehicle tailwind in terms of revenue in the quarter and the light vehicle diesel headwinds, just in terms of ballpark?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","We can give you more numbers later on, but I'll tell you the magnitude. We saw low double-digit growth in that segment to give you an idea of how much of a tailwind it was, All right? So, that's on top of, we haven't seen growth now for three years or four years. So, I mean, it definitely was a nice tailwind. And then I think in the script, it was about 100 basis points of the outgrowth that we had, okay?","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thanks, Rod.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Yes. Thank you. Couple of questions. First around diesel, I see the slide in terms of the back \u2013 the shift in the backlog from diesel to advanced gas. Can you give us a sense of, A, the manufacturing footprint for those substitute products, and, B, what that implies about the decrementals, incrementals, as you ramp down diesel, things like turbos and EGR and ramp up the gas equivalents?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yes, Brian, I can take a shot at that. So, for us, what it implies is, when customers, OEMs shift capacity from diesel to gasoline turbos, we're in a good place. Most of the capacity that we have is generic between a gas turbo and a diesel turbo. There are some unique things within the supply chain. But that's manageable. Likewise, on the EGR technology, those products migrate from a diesel EGR platform to gas, it's transferable. I would say the (38:41) is a little sticky that's really not that transferable, but that's a smaller one of the three and our VCT capacity ramp is well underway. So, for us, it's not a big deal, really, and we'll be able to move much quicker and much more flexibly than the OEMs. That's for sure, Brian.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Second question, if we look at the organic growth, impressive in Drivetrain for last several quarters, and take out that DCT launch, what is roughly the organic growth rate (39:12) markets that's in? And is there any one driver or is it everything from chains to clutches and so forth?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","No, good question, Brian. It's the full spectrum in Drivetrain. So, let me give you a few examples or a few highlights. We clearly benefited from the truck mix in North America as an example. So transfer case technology is clearly in the Drivetrain segment. So. we're seeing growth there.","We're seeing growth on the rotating electrics from the ex-Remy business across regionally. We're also gaining on our, what I would call our core transmission business, so as we move forward with friction plates and clutch packs, that's driving growth. And then DCT, particularly in China, where we're seeing growth, both with the domestics and the global guys.","So, not one product, Brian. The good news for us, it's a balance across all of the Drivetrain products we're seeing growth and it's balanced regionally also.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then can you give us a number of Drivetrain ex-DCT growth?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","I don't know. We can probably get that for you later, Brian, (40:28) some calculations, All right. We'll get back to you, Brian.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is (40:43) on behalf of Ryan Brinkman.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Good morning (40:47).","Unknown Speaker","Good morning. There are some news articles recently that suggested that Continental and Delphi are considering combining their powertrain businesses. So, the articles are suggesting that Delphi and Continental would retain themselves (41:01) seemingly like growth here, electrification enabling technologies, while contributing to some sort of joint venture than more conventional products, the ones that would boost efficiencies for internal combustion engines. Now, you made clear a couple of times on many occasions that BorgWarner is definitely very strongly levered to all different types of powertrains and Drivetrains.","My question just relates to the more conventional product areas, the ones that would solely boost the efficiency of internal combustion. So, do you think these are also growth areas? Like for example, like turbochargers' (41:41), so we know there's a lot of growth in electrification and hybrids. But what about the just conventional combustion optimization technology, so are these also growth areas? Thanks.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yes. Yes, sure. It's a good thought. Let me give you a couple of comments. First of all, I want to be clear, I'm not going to make any comments regarding Conti or Delphi. That's not my place to do that. What I can do is talk about why we're excited about the growth of BorgWarner in our propulsion business.","To specifically get to your quick question of do we see growth in combustion or internal combustion-related business? Yes, we do. We do. And when we published our data towards the end of last year in our Investor Day, the way to think about the combustion space is it's essentially a flat market as you look out the next five years to seven years. So, there's no real growth there in the market.","BorgWarner expects to grow in mid-single-digit growth and that's primarily driven through content adds (42:42) and more increased penetration around turbochargers, EGR technology and variable valve timing technology. So we do see growth for BorgWarner in the mid-single digits for combustion-related products. That's why we're so excited about it. And we also leverage then on top of that the growth in hybrid products and electric products that makes for us, propulsion's absolutely a great business for us to be in.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John Murphy - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys. You did a great job of kind of delineating through the revenue shift when you look at the diesel shift to gas in Europe. Just curious, as you look at the profit returns in that, are they similar or are they better on the gas side? And then also as we think way out in the future as Remy really grows, and our expectation takes off, will we see better profit returns from that content, or will it be similar?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","So, John, this is Ron. The mix from diesel to gas are similar in margins. If you take a look at the manufacturing process and the components, as James said earlier, there's not a lot of investments to be made. You're going down the same production lines. Turbocharger still has a compressor wheel in it, for example. And the EGR products are very similar. So we don't see any kind of negative movement or positive movement either way quite frankly, in the mix from diesel to gasoline.","John Murphy - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","And then with electrification (44:16)?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yes.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yes, so electrification, as you know, we are shifting products in electrification, so we have experience already in what the cost looks like, what the sales prices are. And they go through a very rigorous review as far as approval, quite frankly, to make the capital investment. And they've all passed, which means that they line up with the current profile of return on invested capital in this company, and the margin profile is very similar. So again, we don't see any negative impact by the movement into that area.","John Murphy - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","And any early read on the GM Europe sale to PSA, what that means sort of positively, negatively or from an opportunistic standpoint for you guys?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah, not \u2013 we haven't really seen anything at this point, I would say, John. To be fair, we've historically done well with GM in Europe and we've done well with PSA in Europe. So our thought is it'll be okay for us, it will be good for us. But we haven't really seen anything materially emerge if that's the right way to think about it, John. But when it does, we feel pretty good about it.","John Murphy - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you very much.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris McNally from Evercore ISI.","Chris McNally - Evercore ISI","Thank so much, guys. And really appreciate the extra detail on the call. Just a further question into \u2013 sorry to beat a dead horse on the Drivetrain growth. Since we saw the step up come in Q4 of last year, it's now been two really strong quarters. Is there also something within there on client mix? Meaning, you had some of the launches, I think it was on the Super-Duty in Q4. So could we expect as we sort of comp through that for a year, we can have roughly high growth in the Drivetrain? And then obviously once you comp through that in a couple of quarters, growth would come back down, more in line with Engine and Drivetrain growing at the same rate.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. I'll take a shot for you. I think, first of all, we feel very good about the traction we're getting in around Drivetrain growth. It's positive. It is pretty broad across a lot of different platforms and products. So, it's difficult to single out one platform or one type of thing. As I would say to you, I think the bigger move \u2013 the things that are going to move it around will be think of truck mix in North American definitely moves it because that's transportation (46:53) content. DCT in China will move or move it up and down fairly quickly. And the growth of ex Remy starter alternator business will also move it. So I hope that gives you some sense.","We do expect strong growth, as we've said, in Drivetrain. It's going to continue, but it's a little bit difficult when you try and break it down by vehicle platform or get too granular because I think there's just a lot of broad growth regionally and across a lot of different customers and platforms now. But the punch line is, Drivetrain is a strong growth part of the company and which we feel very good about.","Chris McNally - Evercore ISI","Okay. That's fantastic. And then is it fair to say at least when we look at the really strong growth in Q1 and we'll see in Q2, that probably the first half we are benefiting, at least, from one of those three truck mix is pretty strong, I mean, in the first half? And we'll see the builds in the second half, that's at least maybe one of the reasons you're just holding off. You want to see a little bit more of the production schedule for the second half of the year before you're able to make more of a comment on full year Drivetrain growth being at this level?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah, I think that's a fair perspective. And in addition to that, I would say China DCT also. Those are the two that are going to \u2013 another quarter is really going to help us get more clarity for the rest of the year for you guys. Truck mix and China DCT are the two that are going to move the most, and we want to just get a sense. Just to give you a little bit of additional color, part of the truck mix is relatively easy to track. China DCT, remember that a lot of these are in launch and start-up volume mode. So that's a little bit trickier to predict, if that helps you. That's kind of what drives a little bit of the uncertainty is how fast will the launch go, what's the vehicle adoption rates in China. But generally, as you can see in the first quarter, we're off to a good start and feeling good about it.","Chris McNally - Evercore ISI","Got it. That's great. Thanks so much guys.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.","Jacob Hughes - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. This is Jacob Hughes on for Joe.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Hey Jacob.","Jacob Hughes - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, how are you doing? I think Great Wall Motor (49:17) announced they'd start manufacturing dual-clutch transmissions in April. Is that a change versus prior? Or are they just doing the final assembly? Or what's the impact there?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Well, they've talked obviously publicly about building dual-clutch transmissions in China for themselves. So they've talked about that publicly, and I've talked about that ramp. At this stage, I'm not really in a good position to give you clarity and detail on what that means for BorgWarner.","Jacob Hughes - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","But I \u2013 yeah, I can confirm that \u2013 as they've already confirmed that they're moving towards DCT. And frankly speaking, it's not a surprise. As I put in my comments this morning, China (50:05) has launched its DCT with BorgWarner content. And we're seeing more acceleration and adoption of DCT in China. So that's what I can tell you at this point.","Jacob Hughes - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then on diesel, are you seeing more pricing pressure on legacy diesel content as you bid for electrical content with those same customers?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","I would say, in general, the pricing environment is fairly consistent with historical levels. So there is generally, as you know, that pressure exists in the market. We have a \u2013 historically, we've done about 1.5% to 2% price down. That's a little better than the industry based on our strong market position. And we think that will continue on.","Jacob Hughes - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Kelley with Jefferies.","David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a quick one on the organic growth in the Engine business and despite the European diesel mix shift here. You mentioned strength kind of across the board in China. Just maybe wondering if you could talk about turbocharger penetration in China and maybe North America as well. Are you seeing any accelerated adoption there in either market? And how it compares maybe to your expectations going into the year so far?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah, David, good thought. I think in general, it's playing out pretty much as we had anticipated in terms of both China and North America for turbo penetration numbers. I don't have the number in front of me. Maybe we can get back to you, David.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Penetration in China is 35%. North America is 20%.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Okay. But I would say it's pretty much in line, David. And that's obviously what's driving good growth for us in those two regions. But no acceleration or deceleration in terms of adoption rate from what we had anticipated at the beginning of the year, if that's helpful for you.","David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC","Okay, great. Thank you. Very helpful. And then kind of switching gears here, it'd be great to get some commentary on the Autotech Ventures investment, maybe kind of the thought process behind the move, how you plan on leveraging the investment, and is there any specific segments or high-level secular opportunities you're actively looking for that may be that investment might help connect you to?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. No, thanks for bringing that up, David. It's \u2013 yeah, it's really exciting for us. What it fundamentally has done for us is given us a very, frankly, effective and efficient way to get access to a lot of start-up business and operations focused on ground transportation.","So this is not a highly broad-reaching area for ground transportation. So it's focused in our space. And it basically gets access to start-ups in \u2013 around the world. So, it's not just a \"Silicon Valley Initiative\".","We see start-up ideas from Tel Aviv. We see them from Europe. We see them \u2013 and we have the ability to engage with these start-ups in very different ways. Key to us, though, is getting access to some of those start-up technologies that can help our business, could be disruptive to our business, and making sure that we don't ever get surprised with some new inventions that are coming out of there that we're not part of. We want to get in on the front end of it.","So, yeah, it's pretty exciting, it's pretty early for us. But we're really, really encouraged by both the amount of start-ups that are coming through and the relevance to our propulsion space. So there'll be a lot more to come on this, David, but it's very exciting and we're off to a good start with it.","David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC","All right, great. I really appreciate the color. Thanks for taking my questions, guys.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thanks.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you, David.","Operator","Your next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, everybody. So the first question is in reference to Continental's Capital Markets kind of powertrain day, a couple of days ago. They had disclosed that they were loss-making in their EV efforts, and perhaps temporarily so as they're kind of ramping up.","I'm just wondering, is that \u2013 as \u2013 they think they're working on their last-generation internal combustion engine. I don't know if you agree with that. But can you, at least, if you isolate the EV efforts for passenger car propulsion \u2013 I'm excluding the core business of Remy, let's say, that you acquired, is it reasonable to assume that as you kind of invest and build that up, at least temporarily, there's some losses that won't be covered by revenue for a number of years before the payoff comes?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah, Adam, let me take a shot at that for you. We don't see that is the quick punch line. We're not \u2013 and there's a couple of data points here. We've been invested into hybrids and electrics for a number of years. And if you think about it, our R&D percentage has kind of trended around that 4% through that period. So that's one indicator. And if you look at our after-tax ROIC numbers over that period, they're not coming materially down. They're bouncing around that 15% area. And as we look today at the products that we're shipping today in boxes to customers, single-speed transmissions and other products, those are all at the BorgWarner-type levels. So we are not experiencing any headwinds as we migrate the portfolio to more hybrids and more electrics for the company (55:35). We're not seeing that at all.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, James. And just as a follow-up, what is your working assumption of when the cost of owning an EV becomes lower than owning an internal combustion engine?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","You asking for the when, Adam, what year or what...","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Well, I mean, like roughly. And I know you can't pinpoint a year. But do you have a working assumption of when your customers \u2013 or the end customer is going to find an EV to be more affordable to own than an internal combustion engine?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah, I would say this way, Adam. We have \u2013 we \u2013 for sure, we model out the various propulsion architectures over time and look at those kind of variables. We don't have a pinpoint number that we look at. What we look at is what do we see as the future of a hybrid propulsion system costing and what are the drivers behind that, same with the pure EV. But, candidly speaking, we're not in the game of deciding the when and the what. We're going to participate across all three architectures and be well positioned there. So for us, it's not a big, big driver either way, what that mix is between hybrid and electric and combustion products.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's it (56:48) James. Thank you.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thanks, Adam.","Operator","Your next question comes from Richard Kwas from Wells Fargo Securities.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, gentlemen.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Good morning, Rich.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Hey, Rich.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Just a few quick follow-ups, hopefully. So, Ron, CV assumption for the year, my recollection was within the initial guidance, it was kind of flat. Is that revised higher at this point? I would assume it had.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Rich, you're right. First of all, the guidance was flat. And I would say the guide at this point \u2013 we had a good quarter, but at this point, the guide still is flat, Rich. This market's fooled us in the past and we got to see \u2013 like James said earlier, we got to see another quarter of continued improvement before we get really excited about it.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And what's China heavy truck for you now, as a percentage of the commercial vehicle, your commercial vehicle business?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","I'd say about 15% or 20% for the total CV business, Rich.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. All right, great. And then \u2013 also within the guidance is the diesel penetration closer to down 200 basis points for the year? Is that what's embedded? I know you've said 100 to 200 basis points annually over the next few years, but are you embedding a more slightly conservative outlook?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. I would say as we came in 100 to 200 basis points, we're probably at 300 to 400 basis points now, Rich, is what we're thinking.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then last one just longer term on EGR, my recollection was gas EGR had a pretty low penetration, single-digits, but my numbers are stale going back a few years ago. Where are you now or at least the industry is now with regards to adoption of EGR and gas?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah, your recollection was right, Rich, it's \u2013 it's single-digit-type numbers, but we're finding it's starting to climb. So we're starting to see more quotes, more interest, and more applications. And so, I would say, it's pretty much in line with what we were at six months ago. And I would tell you the perspective is we feel good about win rates in that space. That's the other area I'm feeling pretty good about. So it's a climb up, Rich, from single-digits and it's just going on keep on climbing up over the period.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Is there a number by 2019 that we should think about as the....","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","We can get that for you, Rich.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","(59:07).","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's fine.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","(58:09) number.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right, we'll take it offline.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","We look at that.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah.

Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. This is Joe Vruwink for David.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Good morning, Joe.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Hey, Joe.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Morning. Just one question, one thing we hear a lot \u2013 and I think you guys have said in the past as well as when an automaker picks up the phone and is thinking about electrifying the powertrain, that first call is typically to the mechanical component supplier. And the question is, can you handle the electrical piece with the mechanical? It's not the inverse? Do you agree with that sentiment? And is that still accurate? It would seem like your current competitors that ultimately \u2013 even though you're typically butting up against five and six good suppliers. It would seem like that narrows even a bit more, because obviously the companies that can handle both are certainly fewer. Just your thoughts on both of those?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. I'll take a shot at that for you, Joe. I think the first and most important thing that's on the OEM's mind is to call the guy that understands the propulsion system and all that comes with that, the interface between engine and transmission and the vehicle. And I think it's fair to say a lot of that resident knowledge, expertise generally as a \u2013 in general, will start or lead with the mechanical \u2013 electromechanical aspects, but they absolutely want somebody to understand that, the electromechanical, the system, the power electronics, and the motor. And that makes us one of a few \u2013 a small group that can offer them that support and that capability.","And the last point I would make, Joe, that's really important is they want to make that call whether it's a combustion propulsion, a hybrid, or a pure EV propulsion, because they want that partner to help determine with them what propulsion mix they should be working forward with (61:21). And that's definitely BorgWarner in our perspective over the last couple of years.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Ronald T.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Ken Lamb, Director, Investor Relations. Mr. Lamb, you may begin your conference.","Kenneth Lamb","Thanks, Melissa. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. We issued our earnings release this morning at 8 a.m. Eastern Time. It's posted on our website, borgwarner.com, on our home page. A replay of today's conference call will be available through May 8. The dial-in number for that replay is (855) 859-2056. You'll need the conference ID, which is 18708099. The replay will also be available on our website.","With regard to our Investor Relations calendar, we will be attending the following conferences between now and our next earnings release: May 7, we'll be at the Wells Fargo Industrial & Construction Conference in New York; May 14, we will be at the Barclays Americas Select Franchise Conference in London; May 28, we'll be at the KeyBanc Automotive, Industrial and Transportation Conference in Boston; and June 4, we will be at the Deutsche Bank Industrials Conference in Chicago.","Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties, as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today.","Now moving on to our results. James Verrier, President and CEO, will comment on first quarter results, as well as some of our accomplishments during the quarter. And then Ron Hundzinski, our CFO, will discuss the details of our operating results and also our updated outlook for 2014.","With that, I'll turn it over to James.","James R. Verrier","Thank you Ken, and good day, everybody. Ron and I are very pleased today to review our first quarter results, as well as our recent accomplishments. First of all, I'd like to take a moment to congratulate and thank all of the BorgWarner employees for an excellent first quarter. Your efforts just continue to drive outstanding results for the company.","So now on to our results. Reported sales are up in the quarter with $2.1 billion, which is up 9% from a year ago when we exclude the impact of foreign currencies and the Wahler acquisition. U.S. GAAP earnings were $0.69 per share, or $0.83 per share excluding the restructuring charges. Our operating income, again excluding noncomparable items, was an impressive 13.1% in the quarter. And we see 2 key factors that drove our strong results: solid sales growth in both Engine and Drivetrain segments and operational efficiency and cost controls that enabled strong incremental margins. Really outstanding performance by our operations.","Let me go through the 2 segments, first of all, the Engine segment. First quarter sales were just over $1.4 billion, which is up about 8% from a year ago after excluding the impact of foreign currencies and Wahler. These results were led by strong turbocharger sales in Europe and China, new engine timing and VCT launches in China and higher EGR cooler and valve sales around the world.","Into the Drivetrain segment, sales were approximately $680 million. That's up 12% from a year ago when we exclude foreign currencies. The Drivetrain results were driven by strong all-wheel drive sales in North America. We saw higher dual-clutch transmission module volumes in Europe and higher transmission component sales in Korea.","Now while the Drivetrain business continues to grow, our restructuring plan is paving the way for a more profitable business in the future. We're minimizing drivetrain's high-cost footprint and simultaneously investing in Poland, Hungary, Mexico and China. And we see these actions will enhance Drivetrain's competitive position, which we expect to translate into winning more business in the future.","Now these segment reviews highlight a couple of the core strengths of the company. Now the first one is our entire product portfolio is in high demand and contributed to our global growth. And we are seeing the improvements in Drivetrain, as expected, and continued strong performance in the Engine group.","Now as we look to the future, we see BorgWarner continues to invest for the long term. Capital spending continues to grow. We spent about 6.1% of sales on capital in the first quarter, which is pretty much in line with our expectations, and we remain committed to supporting our future growth and productivity improvements.","Our spending for R&D was about 4% of sales in the quarter, again, in line with our targeted spend of greater than 4% of sales this year. And I see the intensity around organic innovation and product development remains very strong inside the company.","I'd like to take a moment or 2 to review some exciting announcements that we did make during the quarter. As I mentioned before, we completed the Wahler acquisition in the first quarter. And from a strategic perspective, Wahler's EGR valve technology we see very well positioned to exploit the rapid adoption of EGR in gasoline engines. And this, combined with its thermostat technology, makes it a very strong addition to our portfolio. And Ron will discuss the financial details of the Wahler transaction in just a few minutes.","The company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per share of common stock. The dividend is payable on May 16 to shareholders of record on May 2.","BorgWarner also received an Automotive News PACE Innovation Partnership Award for its collaboration with General Motors on the Eco-Launch solenoid valve. We have several patents pending for this innovation, and GM has already committed to using the technology on an upcoming vehicle. BorgWarner's innovation also received a 2014 Automotive News PACE Award. Last but not least, BorgWarner was formally named the North American supplier of all-wheel drive transfer cases for the Toyota Tundra pickup truck.","Now I'm going to provide an overview of our guidance for 2014, which has been updated a little since our last earnings call. We see sales growth in 2014 expected to be between 12% and 15%. This is up from the 7% to 11% previously, primarily due to the impact of the Wahler acquisition. Our operating margin remains at 12.5% or better. And our earnings guidance has been raised to $3.15 to $3.30 per diluted share, which is up from the $3.10 to $3.25 per diluted share previously. Again, both ranges exclude noncomparable items.","So as I said, this is only a high-level overview of our updated guidance, and Ron will take you through the details shortly.","So I see the first quarter as a strong start to what we expect to be another strong year for BorgWarner. We are expecting industry-leading revenue growth and continued excellence from our operation, and we see this combination resulting in tremendous earnings power for our company. The industry's adoption of our leading-edge powertrain technology we see will continue for years. And because of this, I feel very, very good about our company's future and really believe that no company in the auto sector is better positioned for long-term profitable growth than BorgWarner.","So now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ron.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Thank you, James, and good day, everyone. Before I begin reviewing the financials, I also would like to commend all of our employees for their hard work and congratulate them on another great quarter. Once again, the team exceeded expectations. Congratulations.","Now on to our financials. James already provided a detailed review of our sales performance in the quarter. In summary, sales were up 9% from a year ago, excluding the impact of foreign currencies and the Wahler acquisition. The growth in the quarter came from both segments, from nearly every product group and from around the world. Overall, a strong quarter for sales.","Working down the income statement. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 21.4% in the quarter. That's a 120-basis-points improvement from a year ago, tremendous performance.","SG&A as a percentage of sales was 8.3% in the quarter, down 30 basis points from a year ago. R&D spending, which is included in SG&A, was 3.9% of sales in the first quarter, in line with R&D spending a year ago. This implies that all of the 30-basis-points decline was in other SG&A spending. We attribute this to good execution of our cost control plan.","Reported operating income in the quarter was $233 million. However, this includes a $40 million charge related to restructuring activities that I will discuss shortly. Excluding the charge, operating income was $273 million, or 13.1% of sales, compared with 11.7% of sales on a comparable basis a year ago. After excluding the impact of foreign currency, the Wahler acquisition and the restructuring charge, our year-over-year incremental margin was 34%, well above our mid-teens incremental margin target.","In summary, operational efficiency led to an improved gross profit margin. Cost controls led to lower SG&A spending. This enabled us to maintain R&D spending and expand our operating income. Outstanding performance by operations and a great start to the year.","As you look further down the income statement, equity in affiliate earnings was $9 million in the quarter, down slightly from $10 million last year. This represents the performance of NSK-Warner, our 50-50 joint venture in Japan, which sells transmission components to our Japanese customers in Japan and China; as well as TEL, our turbocharger joint venture in India. Interest expense and finance charges were $8 million in the quarter, down slightly from $10 million a year ago.","Provision for income taxes in the quarter on a reported basis was $68 million. However, this includes a $9 million tax benefit related to restructuring. Excluding the impact of restructuring, provision for income taxes was about $77 million, which is an effective tax rate of about 20% in the quarter. Our estimated effective tax rate for the full year, excluding noncomparable items, is now 28%, up from 27% previously. This change is primarily due to a shift in our cash repatriation strategy. We are now focusing -- forecasting that the cash generated by our Chinese operations will be enough to fund our growth in China, as well as supplement other corporate initiatives. Therefore, we will begin repatriating cash from China in 2014 and expect this to continue for the foreseeable future. On an EPS basis, this will cost $0.05 per share in 2014.","Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest was $8 million in the quarter, up from $7 million a year ago. This line item reflects our minority share, partners' share in the earnings performance of our Korean and Chinese consolidated joint ventures.","That brings us back to net earnings, which were $159 million in the quarter, or $0.69 per share. Excluding the impact of restructuring activities, net earnings were $0.83 per share, up 28% from $0.65 per share a year ago.","Now let's take a closer look at our operating segments in the quarter. As James said earlier, reported Engine segment sales were $1.4 billion in the quarter. Excluding currency and Wahler, Engine segment organic sales growth was 8% from a year ago. On a reported basis, adjusted EBIT for the Engine segment was 16.4% of sales. Excluding currency and Wahler, adjusted EBIT for the Engine segment was 17.2% of sales, up 110 basis points from 16.1% reported a year ago. Excluding currency and Wahler, the Engine segment's performance -- year-over-year incremental margin was 31% in the first quarter. Excellent performance by the Engine segment.","In the Drivetrain segment, reported sales were $681 million in this quarter. Excluding currency, organic sales was up 12% from a year ago. On a reported basis, adjusted EBIT was 11.8% of sales. Excluding currency, adjusted EBIT was 11.9% of sales, sharply up from 9.3% of sales a year ago. Excluding currency, the Drivetrain segment year-over-year incremental margin was 34% in the first quarter, another outstanding quarter for the Drivetrain segment.","As mentioned earlier, the Drivetrain restructuring continues. We have reached several agreements with the labor unions of both European facilities that we intend to close. The $40 million charge taken in the first quarter of 2014 was primarily related to one of the agreements. Charges related to the other agreement will come in future quarters.","In summary, of the estimated $140 million total cost of restructuring plan, we have now taken approximately $90 million in charges, just over $50 million in the fourth quarter in 2013 and $40 million in the first quarter of 2014. To date, nearly 2\/3 of the charges have been cash outlays for severance and other activities. We expect the remaining $50 million to also be primarily cash. From a performance perspective, we expect this restructuring plan to improve segment margins by 100 basis points or more and make the Drivetrain segment a solid double-digit business. We now expect that these actions will be taken for the next -- to the end of 2015, and the full benefit of restructuring is expected to be realized beginning in 2016.","Now let's take a look at our balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $46 million of net cash from operating activities in the first quarter, up from $16 million a year ago. This increase was primarily related to higher net earnings. Capital spending, which was $126 million in the first quarter, up $39 million from a year ago. This increase was driven by capital required to support our backlog of net new business, which is gaining momentum.","Free cash flow, which we define as net cash from operating activities less capital spending, was an outflow of $80 million in the first quarter. The first quarter is typically a challenge as it relates to cash flow. Our investment in working capital ramps up in the first quarter to match higher levels of business activity compared with the end of the year. Despite this, we still expect to generate strong free cash flow in 2014.","Looking at the balance sheet itself. Balance sheet debt increased by $144 million at the end of the first quarter compared with the end of 2013. Cash decreased by $131 million during the same period.","Net debt increased by $275 million, primarily due to the capital expenditures and the Wahler acquisition. Our net debt-to-capital ratio is 13%, up from 7.2% at the end of 2013. Net debt to EBITDA at the end of the year, on a trailing 12-month basis, was 0.4. Our capital structure remains in excellent shape.","Before I review our updated guidance, I would like to go over some discussions of the Wahler acquisition. The total consideration for Wahler was $143 million, or about 0.4x sales. From a performance perspective, the operating income margin for the business is mid-single digits today. However, we've identified operational efficiency and footprint opportunities to present a clear path to double-digit margins for this business. We expect to achieve these levels in 2 to 3 years. As James mentioned, Wahler is a very good strategic fit for us, with great technology, an attractive customer base and BorgWarner-like growth. Once we've had a chance to restructure the business, it will be a solid contributor to our bottom line as well.","Now I'd like to discuss our guidance for 2014. James reviewed our guidance at a high level, I'll discuss some of the finer points. Our sales guidance range is now 12% to 15%, up from 7% to 11% previously. From midpoint to midpoint, that's a 450-basis-point increase. The 2 components of the increase are Wahler and currency. Wahler sales are expected to add about 350 to 400 basis points of sales growth in 2014. But please note, that's for 10 months of sales.","Previously, our sales growth guidance assumed very little currency impact. However, due to the favorable impact of currency on the first quarter sales and a more favorable outlook for the euro, we now expect currency to contribute 50 to 100 basis points of sales growth this year. We still expect raw material inflation of $5 million to $10 million in 2014, still a headwind, but less than what we see in a typical year.","As James mentioned earlier, our operating income margin is expected to remain at 12.5% or better in 2014. This should be viewed in 2 parts. Wahler is not expected to contribute operating income in 2014 because of purchase price accounting adjustments, which will have an unfavorable impact on our operating margin. However, due to an improved outlook for the rest of our business, we are able to maintain our operating margin guidance.","On the EPS guidance range, the range has been raised to $3.15 to $3.30 per diluted share, up from $3.10 to $3.25 per diluted share. The $0.05 per share increase has 2 components: a $0.05 per share unfavorable impact from a higher tax rate, and a $0.10 per share favorable impact from an improved outlook for the business.","Finally, our expected diluted share count for 2014 is unchanged at approximately 230 million shares. This diluted share count guidance excludes any share repurchases that may be executed during the year.","We continue to be confident in our ability to execute in any market. This company has demonstrated a heightened focus on efficiency and cost control. This focus resulted in highly efficient growth and record margins each of the last 4 years. With the return to historical growth rates and our operations performing at a very high level, 2014 should be another year of record sales and record profits for BorgWarner. As we look beyond 2014, we intend to execute our growth plan, yielding high-single to low double-digit growth and to efficiently convert our sales growth to profits. The future is very bright for BorgWarner.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ken.","Kenneth Lamb","Thanks, Ron. Now let's move to the Q&A portion of the call. Melissa, please remind everyone of the Q&A procedure.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple from me. Ron, on the guide here, so you talked about Wahler and then FX. So it doesn't sound like you've assumed any improvement beyond -- or any production improvement beyond what you were thinking at the beginning of the year. Is that a fair statement?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Coming into the year, Rich, our guidance was based on program-level volume assumptions. So basically, our projections haven't changed today than they were when we came into the year. So we're still executing to our plan this year, and that's where our guidance is set at.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then is South America -- I know that you have some commercial business down there. How much of a drag on the business is that at this point going forward?","James R. Verrier","Yes, Rich, this is James. It's -- you're right. It's primarily for us a commercial vehicle business. It's not that significant for us. Some of the conditions down there are not too bright right now, as you know, but it's not too material for us.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. All right. And then on Drivetrain, so the margins were very strong. You're still early stages on the restructuring. How should we think about that 100 basis points of structural margin expansion going out a couple of years and the benefit from that, given the performance here over the last couple of quarters?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Yes, Rich, let me set the starting point on this 100-plus basis points improvement. I think what everybody should do is they should take a look at 2013 as the base year and do your projections from that base year. I would not say take a look at the current run rate of the margins in that segment. So go back to 2013, which I'll give you the number, I think it was 10%, 10.3% for the full year.","Kenneth Lamb","Let me add one thing, Rich, before you go to your next question. We are -- we did say that while we're growing during this restructuring period, you can still expect us to get our mid-teens incremental margins on that growth in Drivetrain while we're doing the restructuring.","James R. Verrier","Yes.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. All right. But, I mean -- so it sounds like here in Q1, you had some things that went very favorable that are not necessarily sustainable. Is that...?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Well, Rich, we know a couple of things. One is the restructuring activities have just really begun. We made -- we have agreements now with the works councils. But now I'll just say this for the operating guys, the hard work starts. They have to start moving machinery and equipment and startup. So although they had a great quarter -- I'm not going to take that away from them, fantastic quarter. But in the subsequent quarters, now that we have those agreements, this is when all the equipment starts to move. And any time you start going through that process, it can get a little choppy.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then -- and just last one for me on Wahler. You said double-digit margin. Is there any reason to not believe that Wahler can get to this 12%, 13% range that the corporate average is currently?","James R. Verrier","Rich, where I would -- the way I think about it right now is -- I mean, first of all, we're delighted to get the transaction completed. I think it's going to be a really, really terrific asset for us, with the technology it brings and the growth and the European customer relationships, primarily. So feeling very, very good about it. The start point, as Ron alluded to, is quite a bit below the normal BorgWarner level. It's mid-single-digit-type numbers. So we've got a good 2 or 3 years of work ahead of us to get it to that kind of double-digit range. And I think -- bear in mind, we're only, what, a couple of months in. We'll have better clarity on that as time plays out, Rich. But I think the real message is great technology, great growth, and we're going to work -- get it up, for the next 2 to 3 years, to that double digit. Where it rests 2 or 3 years from now, Rich, I'm not sure. We'll just keep working on that over the period.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on Drivetrain, because it was such strong performance in the quarter. I mean, is there anything going on with mix there on trucks or anything that might be sustained through the course of this year, as we go through recovery in North America and potentially, a stronger mix in Europe?","James R. Verrier","John, I would say sales came in pretty much about where we thought they would be. I think the operating performance was strong. It wasn't so much of a revenue or a mix shift that drove good performance. I think we just executed, executed well. That's really the driver. And as Ron alluded to, we -- over the -- over some of the recent quarters, it's been a little bit choppy, a little bit that way. And I think this was certainly one of our strong quarters, but no big shift in volume or mix, John.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just a second question on bringing cash back to the U.S. from China that's driving up the tax rate. What's the sense of urgency to pull that cash back to the U.S. and get hit by this higher tax rate? Is there something going on, on the acquisition front or return to capital to shareholders that we would expect to see, that you'd be bringing that cash back for it so quickly?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","John, I wouldn't say there's any urgency. However, it does provide a lot of flexibility to do things like share repurchases. But I would say one of the other items is when we started taking a look at the long-range plan for the business in China, we see tremendous amount of opportunities to bring cash out in the future. So no urgency, but it does provide us some flexibility, and it's going to continue to provide us flexibility in the out years.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, as you look at the acquisition landscape, it sounds like -- because you didn't do many buybacks, that you see a lot of stuff out there. What does it look like? Is there a pace of activity picking up, which it sounds like it is? And is there a potential for you guys to maybe get involved with direct injection technology and some technology there? Because that would be sort of a nice complement to your existing portfolio.","James R. Verrier","John, first off, the activities, they're still pretty intense. We've certainly not slowed down with the Wahler acquisition now getting completed. But I would tell you, or say that the level of opportunities we have kind of in the pipeline, so to speak, is pretty similar to where we were a year ago. So it's a good healthy number. And just like we've talked about in the past, some of those are relatively early in the phase, pretty preliminary, and a couple of those are much further down the process. The way I would think about it from a technology point of view, John, we, we're focused heavily on the powertrain space that we're in. Drivetrain or Engine, we're agnostic, but both either or both are good. Light vehicle, commercial vehicle is fine. And regional, we don't have a bias there, because ultimately, these products that we participate in do go global. So I don't want to talk specifically on individual technologies, John. But bolt-on or kind of related products to where we're at right now are likely to be the primary focus for us going forward. And whatever technology we bring, it's going to deliver the type of growth that we've become used to with the company. So hopefully, that gives you a bit of a flavor for it, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a couple of questions on Wahler. How much of Wahler revenue actually was included in 1Q?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","One month.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","One month? Okay.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Just the month of March.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And do you have the order number in that? Or do I just take one month of the $350 million for the year?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","We said $350 million for the year, divided by 12, so that's a rough number.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. Understood. And how much of a drag is the PPA right now in 2014 numbers?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","All right. Ravi, let me just take one quick second here. Yes, for the purchase price accounting at a normal run rate, you can look at the Q for some details and do some math, but I'll shorten it up for you and give you the numbers. Roughly $3 million to $4 million is a run rate drag. However, that's for full year. But I would like to point out that when you do an acquisition, you have to do fair value for inventories. So basically, I'm going to have 2 months with no profitability in the business. So the normal run rate is $3 million to $4 million, but I did have 2 months of, I'm not going to call them abnormal, of no profit, because of the weight of PPA. That goes away going forward.","Kenneth Lamb","So Ravi, just let me -- this is Ken. Let me add on to that. So essentially, what we're saying is this year, you can expect operating income to be almost nothing...","James R. Verrier","Nothing.","Kenneth Lamb","This year. And then it will improve going forward from growth and incremental income, restructuring, and also the PPA will diminish.","James R. Verrier","Right.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. So do you have any benchmark on what we should put in our model for like '15? I know you said you're getting double-digit margins over a 2- or 3-year period. But just, once you get that accounting headwind out, is it like a high single-digit margin for that business?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Well, double digits, and then I gave you the purchase price accounting, and then you could assign a growth rate to the top line as well, Ravi.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, understood. And just lastly, can you also update whether you have picked up any debt or any pensions or anything else that came with it?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Very immaterial. We did -- all right. On the debt side, it was -- cash paid was about $106 million, a little bit north of that. You can read that in the Q. We picked up about $30 million to...","Kenneth Lamb","$33 million.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","$33 million of debt. So the enterprise value gets up to the $146 million. Pensions were very small. I'll just say that. It's fairly immaterial.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can you just maybe just clarify for us, you said the guidance for incremental margins ex Wahler were mid-teens. And as you indicated, you converted at 34% in the quarter. So what is causing -- it was a pretty dramatic variance versus your expectation in the first quarter. And what are the headwinds that you're anticipating in Q2 through Q4, obviously, ex Wahler, which isn't going to contribute any EBIT. But what are the headwinds that would cause that to moderate back down to the mid-teens?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","A couple of things. I had said earlier in the call that Drivetrain going forward would be a little bit more choppy as we start to move our production facilities to Eastern Europe. That's going to be a drag. Also, the deferred spending in the SG&A lines that we've done in 2013 will start to come back into the business, that would start to reduce our incremental margins. So 2 items, all right?","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And with those items be, kind of, if you were to think about things on a year-over-year basis, I would presume that those don't recur in 2015. So the inefficiencies associated with moving your footprint or some of the extra SG&A spending, that would moderate. Is that reasonable?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Our long-term incremental margin guidance still would remain at mid-teens, though, Rod. So I'm not quite sure -- yes, you're right, we would, in the move to Eastern Europe, those headwinds would go away, but that's already in our expectations of 100 basis points plus, okay? On the SG&A side, in general, we will continue to invest in SG&A at some rate close to or slightly less than the sales growth.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And just to clarify on the Wahler acquisition, I missed what you said about the contribution that you're expecting for the 10 months. Were you just saying, take the $350 million, divide it by 12, times 10? Or was there a specific number you gave? And is Wahler actually growing organically, kind of similar to the rate that you guys have been experiencing?","Kenneth Lamb","Rod, this is Ken. So yes, what Ron was saying was that the contribution in the first quarter was basically that $350 million of sales divided by 12. That was the 1 month of sales that we had for the first quarter. And the growth rate for Wahler going forward is similar to BorgWarner-type growth, as we think about how it's going to grow going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citi.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just on the guidance for the year, I'm just trying to get an understanding of what the operating margin would have looked like outside of the Wahler acquisition. I think, Ron, you talked about the $0.05 headwind from tax, offset by $0.10 of improvement in the business. That seems to work out perhaps to about 40 basis points of margin improvement versus the prior outlook for the full year. Is that -- am I thinking about that correctly in terms of maybe you were -- you'd be brushing closer to 13 if not for the acquisition?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","You're close. You're right, Itay. I mean, it's easy math. You can add back in the sales that we gave you some generation -- general numbers around and then recalculate it. But you're right, you're right in the 30 to 40 basis points, you're right.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, perfect. And then just a couple housekeeping items. One, equity income looked like it was down a bit in Q1. Any thoughts on that for the full year? And then I think with the repatriation going forward in China, should we think about the tax rate in that 28% ballpark beyond 2014 as well?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","At this point, I'll ask -- I'll answer the tax question. At this point, yes, 28% going forward. The affiliate earnings, you have to go back and say where are those earnings coming from. And they're coming from Japan and they're coming from India. India has been a challenged market. I think it will stabilize. I don't think it's going to deteriorate, but it's been a challenged market for everybody. And in Japan, that market, if you -- as everybody knows, they're moving production outside of Japan. Now going forward, I would say that I should see improvement going forward. I don't think we're going to see any continued deterioration in those markets, as far as on my equity line.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And just lastly, any general comments on booking activity in the first quarter?","James R. Verrier","Itay, it was a good quarter for us. I would say relatively consistent with prior quarters, certainly the last 3 or 4, which is good and healthy, good balance across pretty much all of the products and a nice balance globally. So I would say it's been a good typical booking business quarter for BorgWarner, if that makes sense to you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Wanted to ask you just, first of all, on the Wahler acquisition, kind of just the progression of margins over the next 2 to 3 years. Is there pretty steady progression in margins in your opinion? Or is it more of a stair-step in the out years for some reason?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Brett, I think James said this earlier, we've owned this asset for 2 months now. What I would say is we're refining where this business is going. We know the end game. We know where we can be. The timing it takes to get there -- I think over time, you'll hear more from us on how it's going. For us to give you an exact timeline right now is premature.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Fair enough. The -- and then, as I look at your balance sheet after you completed the Wahler acquisition, you've got kind of in around $500 million, $600 million in net debt. Sounds like you're starting to repatriate some cash from China. Certainly, you've got a lot of -- you have a lot of cash. I didn't see that you repurchased any shares in the quarter. I might have overlooked that in your press release. But how do we think about things going forward in terms of capital deployment? I know you've -- you're either going to do acquisitions or share repurchase. But in the past couple of quarters, it seems like you're really slowing your share repurchase down to kind of a standstill.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Brett, let me -- you're right. First, we did not do any share repurchases in Q1. So you don't have to go dig through a bunch of documents to find that out. We didn't do any in Q4. But let's talk about that for a second. In Q4, I funded a pension in Germany of some $150 million-ish, $137 million in Germany, which is -- it's a big cash outflow. Q1 is typically a low cash-generating quarter, historically, for a lot of companies. And as a result, we also did the Wahler acquisition, right? So if you look at 2 quarters, I wouldn't say that's indicative of us turning off the share repurchases. I would just say that was just 2 circumstances that happened back-to-back quarters that put us in a position where we just kind of had to hold still for a while, okay? Now you mentioned China. We see that China's going to generate a lot of cash for us, and we want to bring that back to the States, so that we can continue to initiate a lot of corporate items like share repurchase in the future, and give us the flexibility going in the future with our cash. So 2 quarters are not indicative and China's going to be a great cash flow for us, and we still remain flexible in share repurchases.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Yes, I think per John's question earlier, I think John's kind of -- the flavor of John's question was something along the lines of it kind of seems like you guys are setting up for an acquisition of some kind.","James R. Verrier","Yes, Brett, this is James. I think as I was trying to say to John, that intensity has really not slowed down, and our philosophy continues on. That's still our primary use of the cash, I think, as we all know. And the approach remains the same, really, Brett, that we're working on a relatively large number of possible targets, with the belief that 1 or 2 of those over the next couple of years will flow through and get executed. We know the variable is often the businesses are not for sale. So these things are a little choppy in terms of how you get them -- how quickly you can get them done or even how you can even predict the timing of the event. But what you guys may be picking up on is there's a lot of intensity and a lot of belief that over the next couple of years, we will do additional acquisitions. And we remain confident that we'll be able to hopefully get that done.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Maybe just following off that last point. How -- I mean, this is obviously -- I think you classified Wahler as a tuck-in. So I wouldn't imagine it to be a huge drag on management resources. But maybe can you give us a sense as to how many deals of something around the size of Wahler do you think you can accommodate, just from a resource perspective, I guess?","James R. Verrier","Yes, from a resource perspective, Joe, we would like to think over the next couple of years, we could probably do a couple more of that size or a little more and be able to manage those. It does depend a little, Joe, in terms of where they land within the business. What I mean by that is if all 3 were in one particular part of the company, that makes it a little more challenging. But our belief is that the list of targets are pretty well spread across all of the BorgWarner portfolio. So for us to do a couple more Wahler-like transactions in the next 12 to 24 months, that's very doable. If we have to do one more than that, that will probably be okay, too. So we're comfortable, which is why the intensity is not slowing down, Joe.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just on Wahler, attacking from a little bit of a different angle. It seems like Engine margins would have been high 16s this quarter ex Wahler. So if I sort of try to extrapolate what you said going forward, is a low double-digit incremental in the Engine business what you guys are expecting for this year, inclusive of Wahler?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Our guidance is always mid-teens incremental margins. That's our target. We don't really give guidance any closer than that at this point.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","But it's mid-teens even inclusive of Wahler being neutral?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Yes.","James R. Verrier","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Leiker with Robert W. Baird & Co.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I've been jumping around a little, so I hope I don't repeat myself here on something. But on the repatriation of cash, did -- I don't think I heard you quantify how much cash you brought from China.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","You heard correctly, David. I did not.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","How much is it?","Kenneth Lamb","Well, just to clarify, David, what Ron did say is that we will begin repatriating cash from China this year. Those were the exact words, get that into the transcript.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","But I didn't give you a dollar amount, David, you're right.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, but can you help us out there, how much cash do you think you're bringing back?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","I would say it's sizable for me to make a tax change, how's that? I know I'm not giving you an exact number, but it's not $10 million, right? It's north of that. It's sizable that I see opportunities in the future and it's a good chunk of cash this year to put me in a very flexible position in the U.S.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Did you bring cash back in the first quarter? Or is that just adjusting it for what you think you're going to do over the course of the year?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Course of the year. We have not yet brought anything back from China. We will bring it back through the summer months.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then as we look at the cash that you generate in China and the excess cash, what portion of that do you think you'll bring back here versus keep there to reinvest in the business?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","David, that's a little bit of a complex question, and I'll tell you why. What we're really doing is we're able to leverage up a little bit more in China than we have in the past, with local borrowing lines in China. Our banking relationships have gotten really strong there. So what we're able to do is leverage up, at the same time, we can bring cash back out of there, which would indicate that we could bring back a higher percentage of the cash flow because of the leveraging. I don't have an absolute number for you. But that's, in strategy, what's going on in China right now.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. And then as we -- have you pull off Wahler and the currency and vehicle production, it looks like your growth above market organically from new business was a little bit on the light side. Is there anything in particular from a headwind that you would call out that's behind this? It's better than what we were seeing last year, but is there anything that's still a headwind for you?","James R. Verrier","I wouldn't say anything significant, David. I think where we're at from a revenue run rate, so to speak, is about where we thought we'd be at. And I think when we look at the end markets from where we started the year, European light vehicle production as an example, we don't see it's moved that much -- a little bit of nuance in between regions and platforms. But in general, it's about what we thought of the end markets, and it's about what we thought inside of BorgWarner, is where we're at right now.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then just one last topic here on Wahler, how much of the purchase price was goodwill?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Just a second, David. You can get that in the Q. But I'll see if I have that right now for you, about $16 million, I think it was, about $16 million. You -- if you go into the Q, which we file at roughly noon today, I think that's what you'll see in the Q.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then -- and I know you kind of talked around this a little, but how much would Wahler add to your 3-year backlog of new business?","Kenneth Lamb","Dave, let me do some work on that and talk to you about that later. But I mean, what we said is we expect growth similar to our own, from Wahler.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Growth on the backlog or your current revenue growth versus the market?","Kenneth Lamb","Dave, Wahler should growth at a similar rate to BorgWarner, which we've said is high-single to low double-digit growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.","Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Thanks for the double-digit margin in BorgWarner, like growth guidance that you gave here today on Wahler, that's very helpful. Is there anything more now that you can comment on? So for example, I know that most of its revenues are presumably from Europe, it's based there. But can you kind of break down its geographic and customer exposures for us to sort of compare and contrast how that differs from your current EGR exposures?","James R. Verrier","Yes, it's -- your instinct was right. It's weighted to Europe, European customers, European sales. It does have some revenue in Asia, primarily in China and a little bit in North America, but it's weighted towards the German OEMs and European sales. One of the -- actually, one of the mainly attractive aspects of the deal for us, when we line that up against our current EGR valve business, it's very complementary. Our current EGR valve business is a little weighted to North America and to China. So when you put the 2 together, now I think our geographic balance and footprint will be very, very good for us.","Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's helpful. I think Drivetrain margin has been a huge surprise and a big part of the story recently. I know that your underlying Drivetrain margins are inflecting better because of the increase in sales and cost discipline. And recently, you announced some more restructuring actions to increase it even further now. With that said, I think I remember that one of the reasons, given historically light margins at Drivetrain were less than Engine was because of like a legacy cost burden that was disproportionally allocated to Drivetrain. Am I remembering that correctly? And then if so, has there been any sort of recent trailing off in that amortization or allocation of legacy cost to Drivetrain that could partly explain the recent better results or that might be one of the drivers of better performance in the future?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","You're right in your memory. That was some items we discussed in the past. And what I would say is when that segment was smaller, it had disproportional impact on it in that time period. But since the business segment has grown, it's become minimized. That, coupled with some pension funding valuations that have got -- have improved over time, the drag on that segment has become to a point where it's minimized where we're at today.","Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great to hear. And then just last question, I know you don't provide your granular sort of organic performance versus industry production any longer by region. You did call out in the release, sort of like turbo strength in Europe and China. Anything you can tell us sort of directionally about how your business is performing by geography? I imagine it's doing better in Europe in the strength there, but any sort of color.","James R. Verrier","I think I alluded to this on one of the other questions is it's pretty much in line with how we thought things would be at the beginning of the year. So if you think of how we -- what color we gave then, I think that still stands pretty well. If you think of how our backlog was put together and communicated towards the back end of last year, Ryan, it's playing out pretty well there. So what that means is we're benefiting well from a strong North American production, trucks help us, China growth continues to be very strong for the company and good growth performance in Europe off a relatively stable or slightly increasing production volumes in Europe.","Operator","Your next question comes from Colin Langan with UBS.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","In your commentary, I believe you said that ex FX and Wahler, the Engine margins were 17.2%. I mean, that seems like a pretty big delta. And in your comments, you also said that purchase accounting is only going to be $3 million to $4 million for the full year. So what is really causing that big difference? Is it mostly FX? Or was Wahler impacted some unique way in that [indiscernible] margin? Or did I misunderstand it?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","No, you're right. It's -- first off, it was 17.2%. But what's happened in the first quarter is, I was trying to explain this earlier, the run rate on purchase price accounting is going to be $3 million to $4 million, except for 2 months where we have to get rid of our fair value inventory at no profit. So that's an extra drag for this year. So that's why you see this large delta between the comparable basis versus what the reported number was. It's just -- I wouldn't pay too much attention to it. It's just a rare situation for 2 months.","Kenneth Lamb","Just to be clear, it is meaningful though. This year, this inventory markup and the purchase accounting adjustment, because it is meaningful, is pretty much offsetting all the operating income from that business this year.","James R. Verrier","Right.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And if it's 2 months, does that mean we're going to see the same impact in Q2? Or is that right? Because there's only 1 month of Wahler in this quarter.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","You'll see 1 month in Q2, but you'll have 3 months of sales. So it's going to be less, but you will have the same impact.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And any color around Wahler in terms of where that puts your total EGR share globally, and any color there? Are you a global leader in that product?","Kenneth Lamb","So as you know, we don't really talk about shares very much. But it has definitely positioned us as a preeminent player in the space. As far as the producer of both valves and coolers, there is really no one else in the world that does that now. That's pretty much rare air that we're in.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And just one last one. Nickel prices have jumped a lot this year. Is that an impact on you at all? And can you just remind us of your sort of protection in your contracts around commodities?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Nickel prices can impact us. There's no question. And then primarily we use that product in turbocharger business, on the hot side of the engine, because nickel is used quite often in heat applications. However, we experienced this nickel price increase some time ago back in 2006. Actually, I was in the turbo business then. Since then, we've taken steps to try as much as possible to put in instruments, either through hedging or through other activities, to mitigate that. At this point, we're able to mitigate it and not seeing the impact completely on our results.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And any color on what percent is typically hedged or [indiscernible]?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Well, you can see sometimes in the Ks and the Qs and some of those tables. Historic -- I can tell you that nickel prices, until just recently, have not been that much of an issue. So you'll see less amount of hedging being done recently in that space than we have in the past.","Operator","We have time for one final question and that question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays.","Dan Levy - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Dan Levy on for Brian. As you go through the restructuring in Drivetrain, how do you think of incremental revenue opportunities vis\u2013\u00e0\u2013vis being in a position of cost leadership. Does that allow you to come out with a better price? And if you get incremental revenue upside from being in a position of cost leadership, is there upside? I believe you had mentioned that there is upside to the 100 bps of marketing expansion, but I was just trying to gauge what that upside may be.","James R. Verrier","I'll comment on, more, if you wish, on the growth. And I think your observations are very real, that as we do go through the restructuring efforts and move our footprint from Western Europe to Eastern Europe, we do still anticipate and expect to see growth in the Drivetrain segment. A good way to think of it, again, is if you take a look at the backlog announcement that we did back in November as a recent -- a decent way to look at it, where it breaks out, and you can see the growth, by product, in dual-clutch product, step automatic product and the all-wheel drive products. So we do see that growth. It's high single-digit, low single-digit-type growth for Drivetrain that we'll move forward with and execute on. And you're right, that's in parallel to the execution efforts of our restructuring.","Kenneth Lamb","Thank you, Dan. I'd like to thank you all for joining us. We expect to file our Q before the end of the day, Ron said around noon, which will provide more details of our results. If you have any follow-up questions about our earnings release, the matters discussed during this call or our 10-Q, please direct them to me.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Ken Lamb, Director, Investor Relations. Mr. Lamb, you may begin your conference.","Ken Lamb","Thanks, Carmen.

Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today.","Now moving on to our results. James Verrier, President and CEO, will comment on fourth quarter and full year results, as well as some of our accomplishments during the quarter; and then Ron Hundzinski, our CFO, will discuss the details of our operating results and also our outlook for 2014.","With that, I'll turn it over to James.","James R. Verrier","So thank you, Ken, and good day, everybody. So Ron and I are very pleased today to review our fourth quarter and our full year results. And as Ken said, I'll also share some of our fourth quarter accomplishments.","Let me kick off the quarter by congratulating and thanking all of the BorgWarner employees for delivering an excellent fourth quarter and a remarkable 2013. Your efforts drove outstanding results in a challenging environment. So now on to our results, and let me start with the fourth quarter. So you see, reported sales were $1.9 billion, which is up 9% from a year ago when we exclude the impact of foreign currencies and 2012 disposals. U.S. GAAP earnings were $0.62 per share, or $0.79 per share when we exclude non-comparable items. Our operating income margin, again, excluding non-comparable items, was an impressive 12.7% in the quarter and 2 key factors drove our strong results: solid sales growth in both the Engine and the Drivetrain segments; and operational efficiency and cost controls that enabled strong incremental margins, again, truly outstanding performance by our operations.","So let me just cover the 2 segments. First of all, the Engine segment. So fourth quarter sales were just under $1.3 billion, which is up 8% from a year ago after excluding the impact of foreign currencies and 2012 disposals. These results were led by new turbocharger launches in China, new engine timing and VCT launches in Japan and China. We saw improved commercial vehicle markets and also higher EGR cooler sales around the world.","In the Drivetrain segment, we saw sales of approximately $630 million. That represents a 10% increase from the fourth quarter of 2012 when we exclude foreign currencies. Drivetrain's results were driven by new all-wheel drive launches in both North America and Korea. We also saw higher dual-clutch transmission module volumes with Volkswagen and higher transmission component sales to Hyundai\/Kia. When you look at this, this segment review highlights a couple of the core strengths of the company. Our entire product portfolio is in high demand and contributing to our growth, and we are growing globally around the world.","In our press release this morning, we disclosed a restructuring charge taken in the fourth quarter, and this restructuring activity is primarily related to the Drivetrain segment. Now while we've seen improved performance from Drivetrain over the last few quarters, we still believe there's room for further improvement. Specifically, we believe margins can go higher and that its cost structure can be more competitive. So therefore, we've taken actions to optimize the footprint to help that business reach its potential, and Ron will provide more detail around this restructuring in his comments later.","So let me talk about the full year now. Reported sales were over $7.4 billion. And after excluding the impact of foreign currencies and 2012 disposals, sales were up 4%. U.S. GAAP earnings were $2.70 per share. And after excluding non-comparable items, net earnings were $2.89 per share, which is up 17% from 2012. And our full year operating income margin, when we exclude non-comparable items, was 12.4%.","So in all 3 key metrics, sales, earnings and operating income margin, we achieved new records in 2013, which is a tremendous accomplishment when you consider the challenging environment in which it was delivered.","Now as we look to the future, BorgWarner continues to invest for the long term. Capital spending continues to grow, and we spent about 6.4% of sales on capital in the fourth quarter and about 5.6% of sales for the full year. And we remain committed to supporting our future growth and productivity improvements.","Our spending for R&D was about 4.6% of sales in the quarter and about 4.1% of sales for the full year. That's a little above our targeted spend of 4% of sales and another indication of our strong commitment to investment in R&D.","I'm also proud to review some exciting announcements we made during the quarter. Back in November, we reported an expected backlog of $2.9 billion of net new business for the period 2014 through 2016, which implies a return to our historical growth rates. BorgWarner introduced the world's first electronic limited-slip differential on the 2013 Volkswagen Golf GTI with Performance Pack. This system greatly enhances vehicle traction, handling and stability without sacrificing engine power. And under certain driving conditions, the technology's enhanced vehicle performance approaches that of an all-wheel drive system but with less cost and better fuel economy.","BorgWarner also signed an agreement to acquire all shares in Wahler, a producer of EGR valves, EGR tubes and thermostats, subject to regulatory approvals. Now with locations in Germany, Brazil, U.S., China and Slovakia, Wahler employs approximately 1,250 people and supplies customers such as Daimler, Volkswagen, BMW, General Motors and John Deere. In Wahler, its annual sales for 2013 are expected to be approximately $350 million, and we expect the deal to close in the first quarter of 2014.","Our Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split. To implement this split, shares of common stock were distributed on December 16, 2013, to all shareholders of record on December 2, 2013. The company's Board of Directors also declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per share of common stock. The dividend is payable on February 17 to shareholders of record on February 3.","Now let me take a moment to review our guidance for 2014, which is unchanged from our announcement of last month. That means organic sales growth in 2014 is expected to be 7% to 11%, and again, this excludes the pending Wahler acquisition. We expect earnings to be $3.10 to $3.25 per share, which is up 9% to 14% from 2013. And again, our operating margin is expected to be 12.5% or better. And Ron will provide a little more color on our guidance shortly.","So I'm confident that 2014 will be another strong year for BorgWarner. We are expecting a return to BorgWarner-like growth and continued excellence from our operation. And this powerful combination should result in tremendous earnings potential for our company. We see the industry continuing to adopt our leading-edge powertrain technology, and we see this continuing for many years to come. And because of this, I really feel very good about the company's future, and I believe that no company in the auto sector is better positioned for the long-term profitable growth than BorgWarner.","And with that, let me turn the call over to Ron. Thank you.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Thank you, James, and good day, everyone. Before I begin reviewing the financials, I'd like to commend all of our employees for their hard work and dedication in 2013. We challenged the team to maintain margins in a slow growth environment and it was a tough objective, but the team was up to the challenge and exceeded expectations. Congratulations.","And now on to our financials. I'm going to review the fourth quarter in detail and then provide a few key data points about the full year. James has already provided a detailed review of our sales performance in the quarter. In summary, sales were up 9% from a year ago, excluding the impact of foreign currencies and 2012 disposals. The growth in the quarter came from both segments, from nearly every product group and from around the world. Overall, a strong quarter for sales.","Working down the income statement. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 21.6% in the quarter. That's 160 basis points improvement from 20% a year ago, tremendous performance. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 8.9% in the quarter, down 20 basis points from 9.1% a year ago. However, R&D spending, which is included in SG&A, was 4.6% of sales in the fourth quarter, up 70 basis points from a year ago. This implies a 90 basis point decline in other SG&A spending, which we attribute this to good execution of our cost control plan. Reported operating income in the quarter was $188 million. However, this includes $52 million charges related to restructuring activities that I will discuss shortly.","Excluding the charge, operating income was $240 million, or 12.7% of sales, compared with 10.9% of sales on a comparable basis a year ago. After excluding the impact of foreign currency and non-comparable items, our year-over-year incremental margin was about 36%, well above our mid-teens incremental margin target. So in summary, operational efficiency led to improved gross profit margin, cost controls led to lower SG&A spending. This enabled us to increase R&D spending and expand our operating income margin. That's a formula for success, outstanding performance by our operations providing good momentum going into 2014.","As you look further down the income segment, equity in affiliate earnings was $12 million in the quarter, up from $10 million last year; this represents the performance of NSK-Warner, our 50-50 joint venture in Japan, which sells transmission components to our Japanese customers in Japan and China, as well as TEL, our turbocharger joint venture in India.","Interest expense and finance charges were $8 million in the quarter, essentially flat with the $7 million a year ago. Provision for income taxes in the quarter on a reported basis was $45 million. However, this included $12 million of net favorable adjustments, which you can read about in our 10-K. Excluding these non-comparable adjustments, provision for income taxes was about $56 million, which is an effective tax rate of about 23% in the quarter. For the full year, our effective tax rate, excluding the impact of non-comparable adjustments, was 26%, just under our guidance of 27%.","Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest were $8 million in the quarter, up from $5 million a year ago. This line item reflects our minority partner share in earnings performance of our Korean and Chinese consolidated joint ventures. That brings us back to net earnings, which were $141 million in the quarter, or $0.62 per share. On a comparable basis, excluding the impact of restructuring activities and tax adjustments, net earnings were $0.79 per share, up 36% from $0.58 per share a year ago, outstanding performance for the company.","As James mentioned, on a comparable basis, 2013 was a record year for sales, operating income margin and EPS. Additionally, our full year incremental margin was 37%. Also, on a comparable basis, the team performed at a very high level in 2013 and we expect great performance again in 2014.","Now let's take a closer look at our operating segments in the quarter. As James said earlier, Engine segment sales were just under $1.3 billion in the quarter, up 8% from a year ago. Excluding the impact of foreign currencies and 2012 disposals, adjusted EBIT for the Engine segment was $208 million in the quarter or 16.4% of sales; that's an 80 basis points higher than the 15.6% reported a year ago. Excluding currency and 2012 disposals, the Engine segment's year-over-year incremental margin was 30% in the fourth quarter and 32% for the full year, outstanding performance for the Engine Group.","In the Drivetrain segment, sales were $620 million in the quarter, up 10% from a year ago, excluding the impact of foreign currencies. Adjusted EBIT was $71 million, or 11.2% of sales, sharply higher than the 8.8% a year ago. The segment's year-over-year incremental margin was 36% in the fourth quarter and 38% for the full year. The Drivetrain segment had a great year.","However, as James mentioned earlier, consistent performance from Drivetrain remains a concern and an area of focus for us. As a result, we have begun restructuring the Drivetrain segment. The objective is to optimize its footprint for more consistent performance and to strengthen its competitive position.","The initial phase of the restructuring was the $52 million charge taken in the fourth quarter. About 2\/3 of the charge was asset impairments, noncash, while the other 1\/3 was cash outlays for severance and other activities. The remaining phases of the restructuring will be almost entirely cash outlays for the severance and other activities. We estimate charges related to remaining phases of the restructuring to be approximately $90 million. These actions will be taken over the next 6 quarters and the full benefit of restructuring is expected to be realized after that.","The plan includes closing 2 Drivetrain facilities in Western Europe and 1 in North America, all of which is now underway. Despite these actions, Drivetrain is a growing business. The other side of optimizing the footprint is expanding into lower-cost economies. Investments related to Drivetrain's growth are happening in Poland, Hungary, Mexico and China.","From a performance perspective, we expect this restructuring plan to improve segment margins by 100 basis points or more and make the Drivetrain segment a solid double-digit margin business. Also, with cost -- better cost structure, the business will be more competitive, which should translate into winning more business.","If you look at the balance sheet and the cash flow, we generated $719 million of net cash from operating activities in 2013, down $160 million from 2012. The primary driver of the decline was a $138 million discretionary contribution to our German pension plans. This allowed us to reduce pension liability risk and deploy offshore cash without incurring repatriation tax penalties. This discretionary contribution was accretive and on par with share purchases of the same amount. I would like to point out where this line item is in our cash flow statement. If you look on the tables, you'll see changes in assets and liabilities of about $273 million. This $138 million makes up the majority of that line item.","Capital spending was $418 million in 2013, up $11 million from 2012. Our capital spending is required to support our program launches around the world, particularly in Asia, South America, Eastern Europe and Mexico. Free cash flow, which we define as net cash from operating activities less capital spending, was $301 million in 2013. Our free cash flow was used to repurchase shares and to pay dividends to our shareholders. We purchased more than 5.2 million shares in 2013, split-adjusted, leaving approximately 11 million shares on the current authorization.","Looking at the balance sheet. Balance sheet debt increased by $155 million at the end of 2013 compared with the end of 2012. Cash increased by $224 million during the same period, leaving net debt down $68 million compared with the end of 2012. At the end of 2013, our net debt-to-capital ratio was 7.2%, down from 10% at the end of 2012. Net debt-to-EBITDA at the end of the year on a trailing 12 months' basis was 0.2x. Our capital structure remains in excellent shape.","Now I'd like to discuss our guidance for 2014. James reviewed our guidance at a high level, I'll just discuss some of the finer points. Our sales growth guidance range of 7% to 11% excludes the pending Wahler acquisition. Wahler sales were expected to be $315 million (sic) [$350 million] in 2013. Assuming that we close by the end of the first quarter, the transaction would add about 300 to 400 basis points of revenue.","Our sales growth guidance also assumes very low currency impact. Weaker Asian currencies continue to offset the stronger euro. We expect raw material inflation of $5 million to $10 million range in 2014, still a headwind but less -- but much less than what we've seen in typical years.","As James mentioned earlier, our operating income margin is expected to be 12.5% or better in 2014, up from 12.4% in 2013. Some of the deferred cost from 2013 will come back in 2014, but we expect strong sales growth, productivity and spending controls to support, maintain or possibly expand the margins. Incremental margins should be in the mid-teens, in line with our long-term range target.","Our expected diluted share count for 2014 is expected to be approximately 230 million shares. This diluted share count guidance excludes any share repurchases that may be executed during the year. Finally, our EPS guidance range of $3.10 to $3.25 per diluted share, which includes the impact of the pending Wahler acquisition, remaining phases of restructuring and any other non-comparable items, excludes those.","All right, here's my conclusion. We continue to be confident in our ability to execute in any market. This company has demonstrated heightened focus on efficiency and cost. The focus resulted in highly efficient growth and record margins each of the last 4 years. With return to historical growth rates and our operations performing at a very high level, 2014 should be another record year in sales and record profits for BorgWarner.","As we look beyond 2014, we intend to execute our growth plan yielding high-single-digit to low-double-digit growth and to efficiently convert all our sales growth into profits. The future is bright for BorgWarner.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ken.","Ken Lamb","Thank you, Ron. Now let's move to the Q&A portion of the call. Carmen, can you please remind everyone of the Q&A procedure?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","This is David in for Rich. So the quick -- first question is on the free cash flow for Q4, a little below than what we expected relative to last year. Is that mainly due to that pension contribution?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","That's a significant impact in that quarter is the pension contribution plus some tax deferral adjustments on the balance sheet.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got you, got you. And then on the guidance, if we assume the midpoint of the margin at 12.5% and -- I mean, the 12.5% margin in the midpoint of the revenue guidance, it sort of implies like a 13% incremental. I know that you said you're going to do 12.5% or better but is that sort of -- is that something that you're sort of still looking at? Or could that go higher versus maybe our calculation that we came up with?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Yes, David, we've been saying that our incrementals will be in the mid-teens, and to me, that's mid-teens.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got you, okay. Fair enough. And then, I think last quarter in Q3, you mentioned that production was going to decline about 3% from 2012 to 2013 on the European basis. What -- can you sort of put into color -- or provide us with some color related to what transpired in Q4? I mean, did it come in better than expectations? And then granted you mentioned earlier on the call that a lot of your revenues from all your geographies improved on a year-over-year basis, can you sort of categorize where you found the most strength?","James R. Verrier","Yes, David, let me take a shot at your first question. I think if we look at how Europe as a region finished up in the -- at the end of the year versus what we thought at the -- a quarter ago, it was a little better. I think it was just -- it was a little better. And I think that's probably a good summary for BorgWarner, too. So a little bit of an improvement in the fourth quarter for Europe. I think the key message, as we now move into '14, is we're seeing growth in all regions of the world and it just -- it varies a little bit around the world, but we are seeing significant growth. Not surprisingly, David, our strongest percentage of growth for the company still is in Asia, in China, and that's probably not a surprise to you when you look at our backlog, which was significantly weighted actually towards China, which we think is a great thing when you've got a country building over 20 million vehicles. So that's really strong for us. And the growth is pretty well balanced as we look across Engine and Drivetrain. So I think Ron alluded to it earlier, David, the growth is pretty much all products, all segments, all regions of the world. Varies a little bit between them. But all of that translates into that 7% to 11% of organic growth that we've talked about, which we feel really good about, David.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And one last question. When we look at last quarter, you guys did great on Q3, did great on Drivetrain margin. Again, stellar performance in Q4. Is that a figure that we could sort of use as a baseline going forward in the 10%? Or is there going to be some choppiness where it might be in the high-single digit on a margin basis on Drivetrain as 2014 unfolds by quarters?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","David, I would say as a baseline, those are 2 slightly above the performance, but I think we're in the range that you like at this point. And then, we're going to obviously drive even more north of that point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on that Drivetrain question and maybe try to get underneath the covers in terms of what's driving this very good margin expansion. How would you roughly divide, if we think of the couple of hundred basis points year-over-year, the 100 basis points maybe versus our model, between sort of you're having a better product mix, higher value-added products, you're filling up some factories in China, other cost actions around the world or maybe kind of uptick in just volume driving it above where you thought -- might have thought?","James R. Verrier","Yes, Brian, this is James. Let me try and take a little bit of a shot at that for you. I think the way I would characterize the improvement in 2013, Brian, is the volume piece certainly helps. We've seen very good growth in Drivetrain in the year and that absolutely is helping the cause. I think the bigger piece -- the biggest piece, Brian, it would be the excellent operational performance and discipline. And what I mean by that is if you take the clock back a while ago, there was -- we had challenges around capital installation, program launches, product launches. And we've done a nice job of resolving a lot of those issues. So the existing footprint or the existing operations have executed well. And that, coupled with the volume has, in general, driven the improved performance and improved stability thus far. As you look out a little bit, as Ron alluded to, Brian, the next step, if you like, in the journey is the optimization of the footprint, as well as the continued good execution that we're doing today. So what that really comes down to is reducing our Western European footprint and a little bit of an adjustment in North America and adding additional capacity and infrastructure into lower-cost regions of the world. So think Poland, think Mexico, think China and that will take us to the next level. So growth plus a better footprint is going to absolutely help take Drivetrain up to the next level, Brian.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And do you have an estimate of roughly the margin expansion from the restructuring actions, or alternatively, the payback period on your restructuring investments?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Brian, it was in my script, don't know if you heard it completely. We said there would be 100 basis points of solid improvement there and incremental incomes going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have yet another follow-up question on Drivetrain, so I apologize to stay stuck on that topic. But the 100 basis points that you referred to as the potential margin expansion, as you work through these restructuring actions or reallocation actions, what is the time frame that you think you can get those? I think you had mentioned 6 quarters would be the -- where the $90 million incremental restructuring costs would come in. Is it over 6 quarters you think you can get that 100 basis points or maybe it would be just a little bit longer?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","So let me be clear here, over the next 6 quarters, we're going to be implementing restructuring activities, which would require us to move some facilities and close facilities -- move equipment and close facilities. After the 6 quarters is when we start to see the significant improvement of margins going forward. So 100 basis points or better, I will say that, or better, going forward after we get all this in place, okay? So we have -- there's a lot of work over the next 6 quarters to get us ourselves in that position.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got you. So the benefits would come 6 quarters out. Between here and there, it will just be the mix and your execution is what -- like what we saw in the second half of this year, is that a fair characterization?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Yes, the full benefits will start after that. We'll see some incrementals as we go forward, but the full benefits of all the restructuring will start after that.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, very helpful. Second question, and this is a high-class problem, but you've been spending a little bit more than 4% on R&D towards the end of 2013 or for 2013. Would that potentially come in as your sales grow going forward? Or should we expect you to be spending sort of more closer to the 4.5% range as opposed to your 4% long-term target in the near term?","James R. Verrier","Yes, John, I think the 4% is still a decent number for you to think of over the -- as you look forward. But as I -- to your point, I think when we get an opportunity to spend a little more in R&D, if we've got some critical innovation programs and products we want to work on, we're going to find a way to do that. So I think 4% is not a bad number and you may see it go a little below that quarter-to-quarter or you may see it go a little bit above it. But we're not going to slow down the R&D spend, that's just a critical, critical part of the company, John.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that's great. And then just lastly, we've heard a lot of issues in the industry of sort of shortage of casting capacity in all sorts of parts. Are you seeing any problems with that, any of your parts, particularly around your turbo housings? I mean, it just seems like there might be some risk going forward, particularly as Ford ramps up its EcoBoost engines with the new F-150 late this year?","James R. Verrier","No, John, I would say 2013 was really a very good year for us in terms of capacity utilization and all that came with that. We're not really seeing anything of significance at this point, John, as around the world, we're not. There's always day-to-day, week-to-week challenges, but I would say nothing fundamental and nothing holding us back, delivering what we need to deliver. And I think you've seen some of that translated into our incrementals that Ron alluded to. So, so far so good for us other than, I would say, normal challenges, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can I just follow up? I think the first question was on free cash flow. Net income was up about $70 million, but the cash flow was down about $160 million. I mean, so you have a pretty big delta between the 2 of over $200 million. So the $140 million was the pension. Was the tax really that large? Or are there other items going on that are affecting the cash flow this year?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","The $140 million is the funding of the pension is what it is. So there was cash left. There's other adjustments and liabilities that at the end of the year that you true-up. And then, working capital actually was in pretty -- we do a really good job -- if you look at true working capital, receivables, inventory and payables. But you have what I call nonoperating items like tax changes and things of that on the balance sheet that changes the working capital number, that you have to fund certain tax payments, prepayments and so on and so forth. I'm comfortable as far as the working capital related to the operations of the business. I would call -- I would say some of these adjustments were nonoperating.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So you're comfortable with the cash flow guidance for next year? Because that implies a pretty big swing, I believe.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Absolutely. If you track throughout the year, what typically happens is the first quarter is a neutral cash flow. You start to build second and third. Fourth is typically a pretty good quarter, but again we had some funding requirements that we met in the quarter that would take that out, what you would have seen on a normal cycle.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of the pension contribution, I mean, any color on where that brings your pension funding by the end of the year? Is that -- it must be pretty close to getting fully funded.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","It's not -- well, 90%, if that's close, that's what we're at, especially with the German and the total company. In the U.S., our funds are very well funded right now. In Germany, we made this contribution, we got into 70%. So I think the average is like high 80s as a company. More importantly now, we're able to put this money to work and match the liabilities with the assets. And in that way, we can risk going forward, adjust movements in discount rates and earnings so that we don't see as much volatility going forward.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And high 80s, is that about $100 million or $150 million underfunded? Or. . .","Ronald T. Hundzinski","I'd have to check exactly.","Ken Lamb","We'll get that to you, Colin.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And just lastly, any color on why the Q4 tax rate was so much lower than normal?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Yes, like I mentioned, we're about -- our effective tax rates -- run rate was 27%. We came in, to be exact, 25.9%. What happened is you can go in our Q, but we took a look at some U.S. state valuation allowances, then released a couple of those, offset by a few other items. There's like 6 -- 4 or 5 items in there that puts and takes, but the net result was a benefit.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And the guidance for next year is still 27%?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Yes, it is. And I'll just expand my comment on why it's still 27%. Like I said, there were those state tax valuation adjustments. And we will reevaluate the tax rate probably halfway through the year to make sure where it's at. We are always trying to lower the tax rate and maybe we'll have some opportunity. But at this point, I got to get a half year under me to see where we're at.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.","Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It looks like you didn't make any repurchases this quarter after doing so in each of the past 4. I'm just curious, probably it doesn't owe, or does it, to the rise in your stock price during the quarter, more does it have to do with maybe the acquisition coming up or the German pension contribution. What do you attribute that to?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Yes. Obviously, I have the ability to look to see where my cash needs are going forward. The pension I thought was a very good move for BorgWarner given that the cash is in Europe. We could take a liability and start to derisk a liability going forward. That was a real good move for us. Now I'm also looking, we have the Wahler acquisition here right around the corner and there's other opportunities for us as well for cash that we're looking at.","Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just a real high-level question about your revenue guidance. I guess now you're pointing to $700 million of backlog for '14. That would be 9.4% growth on the 2013 revenue that you just reported. And then IHS, at least, has global light vehicle production up 3% next year, so that kind of gets you to 12.4% kind of growth although you've guided to 7% to 11%. So what are the differences there between kind of that 12.4% I walked to. I mean, obviously, there's price down, there's maybe geographical profile. Is there anything else that we should be thinking about like diesel versus gas mix or anything?","James R. Verrier","Ryan, this is James. I think the first thing for me that's probably worth reinforcing is 7% to 11% growth isn't too shabby. We feel really actually very good about that and that gets us back in the somewhat normal typical growth rates of BorgWarner. So we feel good about that. The simple way to look at it is, you take our backlog as you articulated and that's a strong number and then you take out price down, FX out and then you look at, I'll call it, a BorgWarner mix-adjusted production volumes around the world. And that's about where you get to where we are. So the quick way of saying it, the pricing is probably a couple of percent, global production adjusted for BorgWarner mix around the world and our products is also a couple of percent and that's what gets you to the 9% number. And again, we feel good about that. That's organically, as we've reinforced. As Ron alluded to, if all goes well and we close out the Wahler transaction, that's going to add another 300 or 400 basis points on top of that, which gets us to where we think we're going to be over the long term, which is this low-double-digit growth rate, which we feel is very, very strong.","Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's great, really helpful. And then just very last question. I know you were already asked about this a little bit, but can you just kind of take us around the world -- I know you haven't in previous quarters, about how you performed relative to light vehicle production in maybe some of your key end markets?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","So we -- what we provided was our global growth and we have maybe stepped away from the comparisons versus the regional look, primarily because when we've talked about this over the last month or so, it's not really a constructive exercise as we've seen. Every time we kind of go down that path, it's a pretty complex analysis from what the market did in the region versus what our sales did. So what's really important to us is our absolute growth. That's what we're focused on as a company, that's how we manage the company. And frankly, that's what really matters. I think when you think about growth, where it comes from is not as important as why we're growing. So that's why we're going to talk to you about where our growth was and where it's coming from and I think that's the right message for you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","[indiscernible] big picture, I don't know if you saw or not, but there's a J.D. Power report which cited some reliability issues with smaller [indiscernible] engines and while they didn't specifically call it turbos or anything, I know you guys are increasingly on those engines. Is that consistent with some of the feedback you've been getting from your customers? Or what -- any comments on that report, I guess?","James R. Verrier","Yes, I'm not sure the actual specific J.D. Power report that you -- the specific one you're referring to. But at a high level, we had -- with the adoption rate and desire for turbo just continues to go as strong as we've thought over the last several quarters and that, I would say, is across all of the displacement ranges. So we continue to see a huge shift towards smaller downsized turbo engines and we're not seeing anything there. We've not really seen any meaningful issues around launches or volumes relative to that type of stuff. So we're not seeing it in our business is the real quick answer for you.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Joe, I read that article earlier in the week, I think, I saw it. And there seemed to be some confusion about the consumers' expectations of certain things. It wasn't truly a durability issue as you would think that the engines are failing prematurely or anything like that. It was, if I recall, reading that article, that there was some confusion by the end users on what their expectations were on some of these things, if I remember, going deeper down in that article.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I know we'll probably hear more about Wahler as it closes. But it does seem like there may be some off-highway exposure there. And I was wondering if that accelerates your plans to sort of move into some non-auto adjacencies, which some of you highlighted in the summer as for the longer-term goal. Well, maybe just a general update as to whether there's any progress on some of those other end markets?","James R. Verrier","Yes. Joe, our current emissions business is balanced between both light vehicle and commercial vehicle. So we play in that space today, both light and commercial vehicle. And your assumption is a good one, that Wahler will bring both light vehicle and commercial vehicle revenue stream into the company and technology as well. A couple of other comments around Wahler. As we've unfolded over the last few years, really, around this emissions business, we've taken a number of really critical steps. We started off with a primarily EGR valve business, North American-centric, and have taken that more globally. Then we did the Dytech ENSA acquisition that gave the cooler capability, which was primarily in Europe but we've now been successful in taking that globally. What this really brings is a really key piece for us, which is valve, tube and thermostat capability but with somewhat of a European-centric view, which we feel is a fabulous asset for us because that really brings strength to us from the German OEMs, both light vehicle and some commercial vehicle. So this is a terrific fit for us strategically, and we're excited to move forward and get it closed and start integrating it into BorgWarner and growing the business. The other -- one other last thought for you, Joe, in terms of the broader question of end markets. Our backlog, again, was pretty robust. I think we were -- 15-plus percent of our backlog was tied to commercial vehicle market and I use that term generically because that includes a lot of off-highway-type volumes as well. So we're continuing to make progress in serving those broader end markets beyond light vehicle.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And maybe just one quick one. Near term, given some of the elevated inventory levels in the U.S., which it seems like weather played at least some role. Are you [indiscernible] near-term schedules, call-offs yet?","James R. Verrier","Yes, I think -- you're specifically talking North America, right?","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes, and sorry, North America.","James R. Verrier","Yes, I mean, so far, what we're seeing is schedules and releases holding up pretty well. As we've started out the year, we're 5 or 6 weeks in. We're like everybody else. We pay close attention to inventory levels and pricing dynamics in the industry to not kind of get ahead of ourselves. But I would say so far so good is what we're seeing in terms of what we were hoping North America would start off at. So, so far so good is kind of our sense, Joe.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Sponheimer with Gabelli.","Brian Sponheimer - G. Research, Inc.","Just looking at the balance sheet, I know I ask this a lot, given that the leverage is so low even after this Wahler acquisition, you mentioned that some of your -- a good portion of your cash is in Europe and that's why it works so well. Would repatriation be something that would keep you from being more aggressive from a share repurchase perspective?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Repatriation is always going to be a concern for a multinational company. We're putting structures in place to make it more efficient to bring back cash. I wouldn't say that's a primary concern. There's a lot of factors you look at on share repurchases, just not one item. You look at your outlook as far as M&A activity, you look at obviously share price, your multiples, you look at a lot of things. I wouldn't point to just one item when you look at share repurchases.","Brian Sponheimer - G. Research, Inc.","I agree with that. Just along those lines, Ron, when we met in the fall, you talked about a decent acquisition pipeline, you kind of referred to it here. Has there been any change in potentially getting closer to even beyond Wahler, obviously, some larger pieces that you think would fit really nicely in the portfolio?","James R. Verrier","Yes, Brian, this is James. We're feeling pretty good actually how the acquisition pipeline is working out. Getting Wahler closed and behind us, which hopefully is only a couple of weeks away, should be a good thing and that will be kind of in the bag. We -- our pipeline is still pretty robust. We talked about it last summer, the target pool companies of about 30 or so companies. Just like with any process, some companies have fallen out, a couple more have emerged and gone into there. So it's still a really robust pipeline for us. And I think the key message that I would probably want to share is the Wahler transaction, assuming it all goes through, won't stop us doing other ones, both from a cash perspective, and probably as importantly, resources and integration perspective. So we're actively looking and engaged in a lot of conversations to get another one done, and we're working as hard on that one as we did on Wahler. So we're feeling pretty good where that's playing out right now, Brian.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So just following on the last conversation, that last question. It sounds like there's a good possibility that you could get maybe another acquisition done this year, possibly, no guarantee, but that's kind of the idea. Is that the idea?","James R. Verrier","It's the idea, Brett. Whether we can execute it is, as you know, I think, from prior conversations, is much a function of the seller as it is us. We have a strong desire and intent. And with a number of possibilities on the table, we're certainly hopeful. But it just really will depend on the willingness of the seller, but we're working awful hard on getting it done.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then -- and I missed the beginning of the conversation, so I apologize if I'm asking something you've already addressed. But as you think about Europe, you think about the luxury brands and so forth, what's your general sense? What are you seeing in the marketplace today? And what's your general sense for the outlook? I know you've got an outlook embedded in your guidance and so forth, but do you see things improving, deteriorating relative to your expectations?","James R. Verrier","Brett, I would say pretty similar to where we were when we were all together in Detroit a few weeks ago, which, for us, in Europe means a little bit of growth this year in light vehicle production, whether it's 2%, 1.5%, 3% in that range. We don't see a significant mix shift between gas and diesel. We're not seeing much of a shift in our luxury or premium vehicles versus none. So it's about where we were in January and that, for us, is actually okay. I mean, that says things are holding up reasonably well, little bit of growth, little bit of stability. And then in the out-years, we're expecting it to be a very slow and modest recovery is kind of our view, Brett.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Stover with Guggenheim Securities.","Matthew T. Stover - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","2 things, or 3 things, maybe. Following on to the Wahler acquisition, how should we think about that from a margin standpoint relative to the existing engine business? I would assume that it's, after the allocation for amortization, it would probably be a lower-margin business. But I just want to make sure I have my concepts straight.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Matt, what we're going to do here is we're going to discuss all of this once we close the acquisition. Purchase price accounting is very complex and if I start giving out estimates and things and I have to retract them, I don't want to go down that path. I want to close the books, allocate all the purchase price accounting and then we'll discuss these in much more full detail in our Q, and obviously, as we meet with you folks as well once we close the acquisition. We'll be very transparent. I want to get a good look at this when I close this transaction.","Matthew T. Stover - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Makes sense. So -- and I want to fully beat this dog to death with the restructuring of the Drivetrain business. If I look at the working capital intensity of the Drivetrain business versus the engine business right now, are they similar? And as you think about the restructuring of this business, do you envision any changes in terms of working capital intensity and CapEx intensity to that business?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","I don't anticipate any changes. But the question is about where are they at today. It's really more complex than just one segment for us because I have several product lines in there. I will say a couple of products in there maybe do require a little more CapEx and a couple of them require less CapEx. So it's hard to generalize in that area. They're not exactly all the same, but I will say going forward it should remain the same.","Matthew T. Stover - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","So the working capital intensity of the 2 businesses is quite similar?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","There's no material difference.","Matthew T. Stover - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","No material -- okay. And on the corporate expense side, typically, in the fourth quarter, you see a tick-up in your corporate expense. It was stable versus the third quarter. How should we think about that as we go into next year and its implications?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","What I would say right now is the average, if you were to average the full year out, that's probably a good number to go into 2014. I know -- actually, we did tick up slightly in the fourth but it's immaterial, but I would take the average for the year.","Operator","We have time for one final question and that question comes from the line of Richard Hilgert with Morningstar.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions, a couple of housekeeping first. Can you disclose the R&D expense for the full year? And did you -- I apologize if I missed this, did you give a restructuring expense number for 2014?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Okay. First, Richard, it was 4.1% on the full year. In the K today, it'll show you the expenses and everything. I think we're up $30 million for R&D expenditures, okay? You can back in for the quarter, which was like 4.6, okay? And now switching to, what was the other question, restructuring? We said that the $90 million additional restructuring expenses would be over the next 6 quarters, I think, is what I said in my script. We didn't identify how much in '14 per se but -- because there's a lot of accounting rules we have to go by. We know within 6 quarters we should be finished with the restructuring expenses.","Ken Lamb","And in case your question was about the fourth quarter, it was $52 million in the quarter.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then was the $90 million primarily European?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","It's going to be primarily European and cash as well. It'll be more on the severance side, I think, is what I also said in my script. Yes.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Given the sensitivity over there to various labor issues in various regions of Europe, are there any risks that you can identify for us to that number?","James R. Verrier","Richard, this is James. It's not an easy thing to do and it's something we take very seriously. These are not easy decisions as a business for our employees, as well as for our customers, as well as us. It's not something we enjoy doing at all. It's something that we feel very difficult, but we do feel that we have a plan in place that will be okay, actually. What Ron is doing is quite right; obviously, he's giving you estimates because things do vary. There's a lot of -- still a lot of discussions and negotiations that are pending with our employees, with our unions, et cetera. So -- but I think in terms of the approximate numbers and the timeline that Ron has outlined, Richard, I think it's a pretty good, decent set of assumptions at this stage for sure.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then finally, wanted to ask a little bit about dual-clutch. Some of the -- when the products were first coming out, some of the knocks against it were that it's a heavier product, the replacement cost is going to be much higher if you have a failed transmission in the aftermarket, and the expense of R&D to use that kind of transmission is going to be higher. So there were these offsets, too. If you compare to a liquid torque converter transmission, you're getting anywhere from 5% to 10% fuel savings. But then you've got these offsets. Are there still pushback in the industry to dual-clutch? Or is the fuel savings enough at this point that we should see more penetration and more high gear transmissions coming in future years?","James R. Verrier","Richard, the quick answer I would give to you is we are not seeing a slowdown in adoption rates of DCT. What I'll translate that to into specifics for you is as we look out over the next 4 or 5 years, we see a compound annual growth rate for the DCT product line. I'm not talking BorgWarner revenue, but for DCT adoption rates of about a 15% compound annual growth rate, which is not materially different from what it was a couple of years ago. So no, we're not seeing a slowdown at all, which I think is good. And it's for all the reasons I think we've articulated before. It's an extremely effective way to get a fuel economy benefit and still have great driving performance. So we're not seeing any real shift there, Richard, is the quick answer.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Are there any competing technologies to DCT?","James R. Verrier","Well, you can utilize obviously stepped automatics, which is also a great technology for BorgWarner, and you can also use CVT or you can stick with a conventional manual transmission. Those are the 4 primary architectures that are used. We see -- and we see manual transmissions somewhat declining and we see growth in stepped automatic, DCT and CVT as a mix shift, with DCT being arguably the strongest growth of all of those, Richard.","Ken Lamb","I'd like to thank you all again for joining us.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to Ken Lamb, VP of Investor Relations. Mr. Lamb, you may begin your conference.","Kenneth Lamb","Thanks, Melissa. Good morning, and thank you, all, for joining us. We issued our earnings release this morning at around 8 a.m. Eastern Time. It's posted on our website, borgwarner.com, on our Investor Relations home page. A replay of today's conference call will be available through May 8, also on our website. The dial-in number for that replay is (800) 585-8367.

Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today.","Now moving on to our results. James Verrier, President and CEO, will review highlights of our quarterly operating results as well as some of our recent noteworthy accomplishments. And then Ron Hundzinski, our CFO, will discuss the details of our quarterly results.","With that, I'll turn it over to James.","James R. Verrier","Thank you, Ken, and good day to everybody. Ron and I are very pleased to review.","[Audio Gap]","thank our employees around the world for another outstanding quarter. Your efforts drove outstanding results that help us to continue to lead our industry.","Now onto our results. So during the first quarter, reported sales were just under $2 billion. That's about down 5% from a year ago, but it's up 3% when we exclude the impact of foreign currencies and the Wahler acquisition. Our growth in the quarter was below our normal high levels due to a few discrete items that I'll discuss in the segment review.","Our U.S. GAAP earnings were $0.79 per share or $0.78 per share, excluding nonrecurring charges. Our operating income margin, again excluding nonrecurring charges, was an impressive 13.1% in the quarter. So considering our lower-than-normal growth quarter and some of the restructuring efficiencies and the new plants and plant expansions that we're managing this year, this is outstanding performance by our operations.","Let me take a look at the 2 segments. In the Engine segment, first quarter sales were about $1.4 billion, which is down 2% from a year ago. But again, when we exclude the impact of foreign currencies and Wahler, the segment grew at 6%. These results were primarily led by strong turbo sales around the world, which was partially offset by some unfavorable mix of light vehicle production in North America. And we believe this is a temporary issue and should not impact our full year growth expectations.","In the Drivetrain segment, sales of $611 million, which is down 10% from a year ago or down 2% when we exclude foreign currencies. The decline in sales for Drivetrain was related to unfavorable mix of light vehicle production in North America and also some launch delays in Asia.","I'm very confident, though, for 2015 this will be a good year for Drivetrain. We expect Drivetrain to grow organically in 2015, and the restructuring work that's underway will position the business for strong growth and margin expansion in 2016 and beyond.","[Audio Gap]","our restructuring and expansion plans designed to improve our long-term performance.","Our financial strength and strong performance is based on our ability to anticipate and drive the next technology","[Audio Gap]","BorgWarner continues to invest for the long term. Capital spending continues to grow. We spent about 7% of sales on capital in the first quarter, which is above our long-term target of 6%.","Typically, our capital spending is primarily for machinery and new equipment. However, with our strong high single to low double-digit growth rate over the next several years, it requires investments in new plants and plant expansions, which is driving some elevated spending in the near term. We expect this to continue through the end of 2015, after which we should return to our more normal spending levels.","Our investment in R&D was just under 4% of sales in the quarter, which is in line with our target for the year. The intensity around organic innovation and product development remains very strong.","I'm also proud to share some of the exciting announcements that we made during the last few months. Just last week, BorgWarner received the 2015 Automotive News PACE Award for its front cross differential or FXD technology. The PACE Awards acknowledge automotive suppliers for superior innovation, technological advancement and business performance. We're very proud to receive this prestigious award this year, and that is our 15th PACE Award since 2005.","The company received Supplier Awards from FCA, Toyota and Honda Japan within the last few months. And we're very appreciative of the strong relationships we have with our customers, and these acknowledgments are very important to us.","The company has recently announced expanded manufacturing capacity for emissions technologies in China, Mexico and South Korea. The emissions business is gaining momentum globally and is a critical part of our growth going forward. Products produced at the newly expanded facilities include ignition products, EGR modules, valves and coolers, variable force solenoids, diesel cold-start technologies and coolant control valves.","BorgWarner also supplies its GenV electro-hydraulically actuated all-wheel drive coupling for BMW's first ever front-wheel-drive vehicle, the all-new 2 Series Active Tourer. And we also announced that we are supplying VTG turbochargers for 2 newly developed 1.4 three-cylinder diesel engines from the Volkswagen Group. Both engines comply with Euro 6 emission standards and improve fuel economy up to 21% compared with the predecessor vehicles.","Now I'll provide a brief overview of our updated guidance for 2015. Sales growth in 2015 is expected to be between minus 4% and 0, which is down from 2% to 6% previously. The change in sales growth guidance is entirely related to weakened foreign currencies that Ron will discuss later. Now excluding currency, our sales growth is still expected to be 9.5% to 12%, unchanged from our previous guidance. We now expect earnings to be within a range of $3.10 to $3.30 per diluted share, which is down from $3.35 to $3.55 per diluted share. Again, nearly all of this change is related to foreign currencies. And again, Ron will provide a little more detail later. And our operating margin is still expected to be above 13%.","So I'm very encouraged by our outlook for the rest of the year. 2015 should be another fantastic year for BorgWarner, and the restructuring and expansion activities are a clear transition to even stronger performance in 2016 and beyond.","As we look ahead, the industry's continued adoption of our leading-edge powertrain technology combined with operational excellence are the primary reasons we have been, we still are and we will continue to be the leading auto supplier in terms of growth and operating performance.","So now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ron.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Thank you, James, and good day, everyone. Before I begin reviewing the financials, I would like to also commend all of our employees for their hard work and congratulate them on a great quarter.","Now on to our financials. James already provided a detailed review of our sales performance in the quarter. In summary, sales were down 5% from a year ago or up 3%, excluding the impact of foreign currency and the Wahler acquisition.","Working down the income statement. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 21.6% in the quarter, up 20 basis points from 21.4% a year ago. During the same period, SG&A as a percentage of sales was 8.5%, also up 20 basis points from a year ago. R&D spending, which is included in SG&A, was at 3.8% of sales in the quarter. Operating income in the quarter was $216 million. Excluding $12 million restructuring charges and an $11 million gain related to a buyout of a joint venture partner, operating income was $261 million or 13.1% of sales. Excluding restructuring charges taken in the quarter of 2014, this is in line with the same period a year ago.","Excluding the nonrecurring items previously discussed as well as the impact of foreign currency and the Wahler acquisition, our year-over-year incremental margin was about 25%, well above our long-term mid-teens incremental margin target. Very strong performance considering the cost of 2 new plants in China, several other plant expansions and restructuring related inefficiencies in both segments. Note that our new plants in China will be up and running and the Drivetrain restructuring will be completed by the beginning of 2016. Both should boost our performance.","As you look further down the income statement, equity and affiliate earnings was about $9 million in the quarter, in line with last year. This represents the performance of NSK-Warner, our 50-50 joint venture in Japan, which sells transmission components to our Japanese customers in Japan and China, as well as TEL, our turbocharger joint venture in India.","Interest expense and finance charges were $10 million in the quarter, up slightly from a year ago. Provision for income taxes in the quarter on a reported basis was $72 million. However, this included a $4 million benefit from the restructuring charge and other tax adjustments. Excluding the benefit, the provision for income taxes was $76 million, which is an effective tax rate of about 29% in the quarter. Our estimated effective tax rate for the full year is approximately 29%.","Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest were just under $9 million in the quarter, up from $8 million in the first quarter","[Audio Gap]","partner's share in the earnings performance of our Korean and Chinese consolidated joint ventures. That brings us back to net earnings, which were $179 million in the quarter. Excluding nonrecurring items, net earnings were $177 million or $0.78 per share, our outstanding performance for the company. Note that weaker foreign currencies lowered earnings by about $0.09 per share in the quarter.","Now let's take a closer look at operating segments in the quarter. As James said earlier, reported Engine segment sales were just under $1.4 billion in the quarter. Excluding currency and Wahler, Engine segment sales growth was 6% compared to same period a year ago. On a reported basis, adjusted EBIT for the Engine segment was 16.7% of sales. Excluding currency and Wahler, adjusted EBIT for the Engine segment was 17.1% of sales, up 70 basis points from 16.4% reported a year ago.","Excluding currency and Wahler, the Engine segment's year-over-year incremental margin was 29%, excellent performance for the Engine segment. The restructuring plan for Wahler is on target. The remaining charges will be recorded over the next 2 years or so, after which Wahler is expected to be a double-digit margin business.","In the Drivetrain segment, reported sales were about $611 million in the quarter. Excluding currency, sales declined about 2% compared with the same period a year ago. Similar in the past 2 quarters, Drivetrain was impacted by a planned slow ramp-up of a major program by a North American customer in the quarter. We expect the volumes for this program to return to normal levels by the second half of 2015. On a reported basis, adjusted EBIT was 11.6% of sales. Excluding currency, adjusted EBIT was 11.3% of sales.","Excluding currency, the Drivetrain segment's year-over-year decremental margin was 36% in the first quarter. To keep this in perspective, Drivetrain lost $5 million of adjusted EBIT on a $15 million decline in sales. That means the segment was only $2 million shy of our target decremental margin of 20%. Please note that the Drivetrain is managing through a cost associated with our new DCT component plant in Taicang, China and restructuring-related inefficiencies.","The Drivetrain restructuring plan is also on target with regard to both timing and cost. We still expect to have the relocations completed by the end of 2015, after which, Drivetrain will be in a much better competitive position in Europe.","Not let's take a look at our balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $33 million of net cash from operating activities in the first quarter of 2015, down slightly from $46 million a year ago. The decrease was primarily related to lower net earnings due to weaker foreign currencies. Capital spending was $140 million in the quarter, up $14 million from a year ago. The increase was driven by capital required to support our strong backlog of new net business.","Free cash flow, which we define as net cash from operating activities less capital spending, was an outflow of $107 million in the quarter, which is typical seasonal occurrence for us. Our investment in working capital ramps up in the first quarter to match higher levels of business activity compared with the end of the year.","Looking at the balance sheet itself. Balance sheet debt increased by $498 million at the end of the first quarter compared to 2015 -- '14. Cash increased by $238 million during the same period. The $260 million increase in net debt was primarily due to capital expenditures, a dividend payment to our shareholders and share repurchases. Our net debt-to-capital ratio was 18.4% at the end of the first quarter 2015, up from 12.8% at the end of 2014. Net debt-to-EBITDA at the end of the year on a trailing 12-month basis was 0.6. Our capital structure remains in excellent shape.","Now I'd like to discuss our updated guidance for 2015. James reviewed our guidance to the high level, I'll discuss some of the finer points. We expect sales growth of a negative 4% to 0, which is down from 2% to 6% previously. As James mentioned earlier, the change in sales growth guidance is entirely related to weakening foreign currencies. Our full year dollar-to-euro exchange rate assumption is now between $1.05 to $1.10, down from $1.20 previously. We also have lowered our exchange rate assumptions for several other currencies, including the Brazilian real, Japanese yen, the Korea won, Mexican peso and the Swedish kroner. The impact of these new assumptions translates to approximately $500 million less in revenue this year. Excluding currency, our sales growth is still expected to be 9.5% to 12%, which is unchanged from our previous guidance.","We now expect EPS within a range of $3.10 to $3.30 per diluted share in 2015, down from $3.35 to $3.55 per diluted share previously. This change in EPS guidance is also heavily influenced by currency, but includes additional interest expense from our $1 billion bond offering. Of the $0.25 change in EPS guidance, $0.20 is related to currency and $0.05 is related to the net impact of higher interest expense, offset by share repurchases.","We expect our share repurchase program to gain momentum over the remainder of the year.","Our operating income margin guidance is unchanged, which is above 13%, which implies a mid-teens incremental margin, excluding noncomparables in line with our long-term target.","In conclusion, we continue to be confident in our ability to execute in any market. This company has demonstrated a heightened focus on efficiency and cost. This focus resulted -- results in highly efficient growth, record margins in each of the last 4 years. With our strong organic growth and operations performing at a very high level, 2015 should be another great year for BorgWarner.","As we look beyond 2015, we intend to execute our growth plan, yielding high single to low double-digit growth and to efficiently convert our sales growth to profits. The future is bright for BorgWarner.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ken.","Kenneth Lamb","Thanks, Ron. Now let's move to the Q&A portion of the call. Melissa, could you please remind everyone of the Q&A procedure?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Ron, on the Drivetrain, so should we think of the delta on the decremental, the $5 million decline in operating income typically would be $3 million at delta $2 million? Is that the inefficiency? Should we assume that? Or is there other stuff going on there?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","That's a good assumption, Rich. But I would also say that in the Drivetrain itself, the inefficiencies are probably actually running a bit higher in that, the number you just gave out, okay?","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then for the balance of the year, I know there's some moving parts, but how are you -- what do you have embedded in the guidance in terms of inefficiencies as we move through the last 3 quarters of the year?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","So let me disqualify, when I say efficiencies, there's 2 things in Drivetrain. There's a couple of startups and there's inefficiencies. So I want to make sure I distinguish between those 2. The inefficiencies are going to take us through this year, and that was the relocation of Western European plants to Eastern Europe. But what I'd also like to point out is that in the Drivetrain, we still have a DCT plant being launched in China that's going to take us through the rest of the year. So the answer to your question is the inefficiencies should get better, but the drag on the startup of the plant in China should continue throughout the year. So long and short of it is we're going to see this headwind for a little while yet.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. But it sounds like net-net, it should get a little less as we move into the second half.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Yes. Right.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, James, there is a comment around a pushout of some programs in Drivetrain in Asia. Is that related to DCT? And then if you take a step back and look at the adoption rates in quoting activity around DCT in Asia, is there any change?","James R. Verrier","Yes, I would say, Rich, from a -- first of all, from a quoting activity on DCT remains very strong and good, primarily up in China or in Europe. So we're not seeing any shift or slowdown in quoting activity and even win rates for BorgWarner. So that remains very healthy. The little bit of the launch delay, a little part of it is DCT, but the majority of it is related to other TorqTransfer and transmission products. But I just want to stretch something for the call, it's not a BorgWarner-related issue, just to put that out there, for the -- if that gives you a bit of help, Rich.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then, Ron, real quick on commodities, last quarter or when you gave the initial guidance, you assumed that commodities -- I don't think you assumed that there was going to be any benefit. Is that still the assumption for the year?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Not anything material. So it's the same assumption, Rich.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So you guys kept your second year revenue guidance unchanged, and that's still a pretty impressive level. But can you confirm that you're not seeing -- or are you seeing any shift in OEM bake[ph] rates or program launches related to fuel efficiency from where gas prices are? And the flip side of that, are you seeing any uptick in Drivetrain-related cost?","James R. Verrier","Ravi, let me take a shot at that. First of all, I appreciate your acknowledgment and recognition of that strong growth, and we feel good about it, too. And as we've outlined, we still feel good about that. The way I would articulate it is, Ravi, during the year, you'll always get little shifts, little mix shifts between whether it's cars and trucks in North America and other such things. But when you get all the puts and takes together, our sense is we're still comfortable with our full year projection of that 9.5% to 12% growth when you strip out currency. But no real significant shifts, Ravi, is what I would say to you in terms of -- in some of your specific points.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And the thing with the guidance here, the mark-to-market and FX is, of course, completely understandable. But we are seeing a stronger-than-expected production run rate in Europe. The SAR in the U.S. continues to be pretty robust. Is your -- I believe your underlying industry growth assumption back in Detroit was 1% or 2% or something. Is there room to pick that up? And is that already embedded in the new guidance?","James R. Verrier","Ravi, what I would say and I think what you -- how I would articulate it is the fact that we're reaffirming our full year view from what we gave out in January, I think, it's an indication that our overall macro assumptions haven't changed materially. I mean, I think you can point to unique specifics in different parts of the world or different programs, customers and countries, but at a high level, nothing major has moved in the quarter. And that's why we're holding the revenue guidance where it is.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And just finally, Ron, the follow-up from Rich's question earlier. If you were to adjust Drivetrain margins this quarter for all the efficiencies, all the -- the China launch and the F-150 delays, what would the margin have been this quarter?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","What I would say, Ravi, I'd have to do the calculation on the margin, but what I would say is that we lost $5 million. And I'd say we'd be nearly breakeven, maybe. So I don't want -- I'd have to do the math there, but we'd be, probably would've been breakeven on $15 million down in sales.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc Capital.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Let's see. First of all, your underlying sales expectations for the full year, 9.5% to 12% growth, is that pretty much comparable to the 3% number you did in the first quarter apples-to-apples and therefore, obviously implies an acceleration as you move through the remainder of the year? Or is Wahler kind of factored into the -- or I mean, are there some other things factored into the 3%?","James R. Verrier","Brett, let me take a shot first and maybe Ken and I will add a little detail. What that implies is Q2, Q3 and Q4 are going to run stronger than Q1, which we're comfortable with. And a couple of those items that both Ron and I alluded to, specifically the North American customer, which we outlined, is a contributing factor to that. So, yes, we're going to run stronger in 2, 3 and 4 than we did in 1. And based on all what we know right now, we're very comfortable with that. Ken, you might want to...","Kenneth Lamb","Yes. I'll add just this one thing. James alluded to the North American program also gaining steam over the rest of the year. Also the issues in Asia, the pushouts, we're expected to recover those in the back half of the year as well. So all of that together pretty much implies that this is a timing issue more than anything is kind of really the message.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Yes. The North American comment obviously relates to, well, the F-150. But the delays in Asia, what is that in regards to?","Kenneth Lamb","Well, James had talked about some Drivetrain-specific issues and that none of them were really BorgWarner-specific, just a change in timing with our customers on the ramp-up of these programs. So a little bit slower in the first quarter, but picking up as the year goes forward.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, Ron, your comment about kind of the mid-teens incremental margin in 2015. Obviously, that's an excluding FX comment. Is it also an excluding M&A comment? In other words, Wahler?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Yes. Excludes -- this is on a comparable basis, which would exclude foreign currency. But actually as you go forward, Wahler falls out, right? Because we had it in last year's numbers, so that won't be as much of an issue going forward.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then finally, did you repurchase any stock in the quarter? I didn't see any comment along those lines.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Yes, we did, 650 some thousand shares, I think it was, $38 million or something.","Operator","Your next question comes from Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just on the F-150 question. Can you -- I get the production cadence and that's come up a number of times this earnings seasons. But is it -- how do we think about the content opportunity there? Is there much different on the powertrain side? I think there was only maybe one new configuration, but I could be wrong about that. So just wanted to see if there was anything different or it's just really the volume piece that's the big teller [ph] .","Kenneth Lamb","I think you said it well there at the end, Pat. The content opportunity doesn't really change for us as you go from the previous version to the current. It's really just the ramp-up and the volumes that are significantly different this year than compared to what they were last year. Last year was very strong in the first half, weaker in the second half, and it should be just the opposite this year.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then one question. I think the R&D number that you gave out, I had it written down, but it was like 3 -- sort of mid-3% range.","Kenneth Lamb","3.8%.","Ronald T. Hundzinski","3.8%. Right.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. I mean, that's lower than what you guys have traditionally done. Is there just a seasonality to that spend? Or is it something you're dialing back a bit as you're digesting some of these other elevated expenses? How should we think about that?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Pat, I can tell you one thing, we are not dialing back. That's one point I want to make. The other point is maybe there's some seasonality because it's pretty comparable to the last year. But other thing that is also embedded in there, and I don't want to go into all the numbers, but there is some FX issues that -- a lot of our engineering is outside the U.S. So you're getting some FX noise in there. And in fact, I think if you right-size that, Ken, wasn't it actually was about 4 or 4%. I think about 20 basis points impact of FX on it. So it's sort of a distorted number, I don't want to go into those details, but we're not dialing back at all. Not at all.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then just, I guess, building up on the Drivetrain question. The rebound that you have there. I guess, just wanted to dig into that a little bit more, like how -- because you didn't change your guidance for that, right? So it is fully assumed that it's coming back. How good is the visibility on those products? I mean, I take it that you kind of see the order book and the backlog, but just wanted to hear more on that.","Kenneth Lamb","I think, you said that pretty well. Our expectations for the full year haven't changed. So all that has played out so far is kind of what we expected. We expected this large North American program to be slow in the first half and pick up in the second half in a pretty meaningful way. I would say, the only thing that was really a bit of a timing issue that was probably not big then was the first quarter was a little bit -- we're just a little bit off pace from where we thought we would be at this time of the year. But we fully expect that to come back into quarters, 2, 3 and 4.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Johnson from Barclays.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A couple questions. More of a housekeeping guidance question and then into sort of a broader strategic question. Do you have any visibility yet into incremental margins for '16 over '15? You talked about they could be a step function higher in '16. How are the puts and takes shaking out?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Well, Brian, we have some of these headwinds as far as inefficiencies and restructuring. We have some plant startups. So I would say that at '16, we go into '16 and I would anticipate, I guess, a tailwind in incremental margins from where I sit today. I mean, it's still long ways off, but I think that's possible.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. The second is a broader question. Yesterday, in a kind of well-followed controversial call, Sergio Marchionne, Fiat Chrysler, made a case that ROICs for auto OEMs were low, margins were low. You probably hear that from your customers all the time when they compare it to your good margins in ROIC. And secondly, that there was a lot of redundant R&D and CapEx across the OEMs, in particular about 20% of vehicle development costs in powertrain. And you would argue and he would argue, in the mass market, V sedan market who really cares about the engine. So I guess, the question is, is this going to be an opportunity at all, mid-term, for you guys to step up and actually kind of move to what I might call the Apple model? Where they're not making their chips, they're not assembling their cars. You're providing engine and transmission components, but you're not providing engines and transmissions. Any possibility at all the industry could move in a direction that would make it more like other modern industries in terms of the value chain and, hence, perhaps offer better opportunities for all players?","James R. Verrier","Let me try and take a shot, Brian. I actually didn't read the details of his commentary. I saw the headline. My take and you kind of touched on this is, we somewhat control what we can from a BorgWarner perspective. And as you alluded to, we feel very positive about where we're running from an ROIC point of view and from a margin perspective. And I would just point out, I think that's -- what we feel about that is that, that's the financial discipline, I think, we like to operate with the company in terms of capital utilization. So I can only look at that perspective from our viewpoint, and I'm very happy with where we're at. Your broader question. The way I would look at it and the way we think about it is I think there is going to continue to be more and more technology applied to the powertrain over the next decade or more. And I see that the BorgWarner's of the world having opportunity to bring additional system capability and content capability. And whether that be around additional content through electrification or even a broader system package, if that makes sense to you, I do see -- I see those as opportunistic -- opportune growth plans for BorgWarner. Yes.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","But any possibility of moving all the way where an engine becomes modularized, common across different OEMs, so it can be plugged into a car, much as a Qualcomm chip goes into a smartphone?","James R. Verrier","I mean, honestly, I don't know, Brian. But I will tell you, today, you see opportunities where there are shared engine capacity or engine platforms across OEMs. We participated in that, and it's been successful. Do I see more of that looking forward? I don't really know at this stage, Brian. But I've seen that model work, whether it's been shared capacity on engine development and a modular engine program across 2 OEMs, and it's been successful. And we've participated in that.","Kenneth Lamb","I want to add one thing to that Brian. While James is making those comments, we also continue to see, as he said earlier, increased technology in the powertrain. We don't see the engine becoming a clotty [ph] in any way. We still see there's an awful lot of opportunity for improvement in the performance of the engine. And we are going to be a valuable partner to our customers in that regard.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes. I was more getting at less maybe a commodity and more -- there's lot of innovation in smartphone chips, but that doesn't mean each of the smartphone makers is manufacturing its own separate chip.","James R. Verrier","Yes.","Kenneth Lamb","Right, right.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple questions. One is just wanting to confirm. You did give us a helpful impact just from the FX. It looks like $0.20, and calibrated to maybe $64 million and like a 13% margin on the $500 million impact from FX. Is that what we should be thinking about going forward? Is it just basically translation? Or is there also transactional sensitivity as currencies continue to move?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","So Rod, you're absolutely right. It's translational. And at a high level, it's roughly equal to our operating margin is the impact both ways on average. So that's correct. I'd like to respond on the transactional side. We do see transactional, but it's not material. Not to say we don't see it, we do. But net-net, it ends up being not that material for us.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And on this F-150 mix issue, got to check the numbers, but wasn't that an equivalent headwind for you in the fourth quarter? You actually had 6% organic growth in the fourth quarter. Are you basically saying that you're not seeing any other mix headwinds in diesel or any other place? And can you give us a sense of kind of maybe high level the kind of organic growth that you would expect in the second quarter as the Kansas City plant is starting to ramp-up now?","James R. Verrier","Rod, specifically, for the first quarter, as we talked about, the significant piece obviously, as you outlined, is the large American platform we talked about. But we also -- the other aspect was a little bit of the launch issue -- issues in Asia that were also playing into that a little bit and a little bit of mix in the quarter, which is basically car truck mix in North America as well. So those were the kind of the components that impacted it. As we look forward, Rod, what's holding our guidance, as you know, from a revenue point of view, so that implies that we're going to be stepping up to more normalized growth levels in Q2, 3 and 4. And we're comfortable with that for sure.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess, I'm just asking your -- I want to say that F-150 was down 40% in the fourth quarter and 40% in the first quarter. So it doesn't look like the headwind is greater. Are there other factors? I would think that truck -- car truck mix would actually be a favorable thing that you're seeing increasingly at this point.","Kenneth Lamb","Well, specifically, the programs in Asia that James is talking about is the main delta from Q4 to Q1. So we talked about those additional launches that were happening in the first quarter that are ramping slower than we thought. That's kind of the main delta.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Can you give us an idea of the ramp from here in terms of the organic growth? There are some pretty big programs that are going to start kicking in again, as we look at the Q2 maybe.","Kenneth Lamb","Well, you and I can work on that offline. But obviously, the full year organic growth number is still intact, so you can kind of back into it, we think the rest of the year should be.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And just lastly, I guess, this has been asked a couple times, but there are a number of unusual headwinds that you're absorbing this year that should go away. And presumably, that's going to help your incrementals into next year. There are also potentially some commodity tailwinds that become increasingly favorable as we look out to next year, just because some things are locked under contracts and commodities have been declining. Can you just put any parameters at all on how we should be thinking about that there's something else kicking into next year that we should be thinking about when we adjust your normal incremental margins?","James R. Verrier","I think, Rod, you kind of hit most of the highlights. We're going through a lot of restructuring efforts in Drivetrain, and that is going to settle down. The other one that's not explicitly been mentioned in the call that I think helps with the transition with Wahler, we talked about that, the entry point there was that low single-digit margin. And we expect to be moving that up. So there's certainly more, as Ron alluded to earlier, certainly more tailwinds than headwinds as we look forward to the setup in '16. But obviously, we're also heavily focused on '15 and very pleased with where we're heading in '15 as well. But generally, more tailwinds. And I think as the year rolls out, Rod, we'll probably give more color on what we can -- how that translates into incremental margins for '16. But I think it's setting up well.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a follow-up on the F-150, just to beat a dead horse here. I mean, obviously, there's some pressure that's in the Drivetrain segment, but also given your content on the engine there, there's a little bit of pressure there as well. Just curious, as you see the -- those lines ramp in the second quarter and real more materially in the third and fourth, I mean, will you get a boost in the engine segment? Because the engine segment margins are still very strong right now, it doesn't seem to be suffering from pressure much, if at all, on the sales or margin line. So just curious, is there a drag in the Engine segment as well and will we see that same recovery in the second half?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Yes, John. So, let's talk about that vehicle that Rich was mentioning here. The content on it that we have is on an EcoBoost engine, we have turbos. Turbos fall under the Engine. We also have timing systems on that engine. So that's also under Engine. And then really, we have transfer cases if a four-wheel-drive option was selected, which impacts the Drivetrain. So yes, the volume reduction we see on that vehicle right now is impacting the Engine segment. But the Engine segment is a lot larger, so it's not as material as it is to the Drivetrain segment.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Very helpful. And second, on mix. I mean, obviously, there's some stuff that's going on with the German lux manufacturers in China, where that market is relatively a little bit weaker for them, and the U.S. seems to be picking up and Europe is a little bit better. Is there anything that's going on with mix, given those different end markets that those vehicles are ending up in for you? Or you're not seeing any change with German lux manufacturers at this point?","James R. Verrier","Actually, John, no -- from that perspective, no impact for us. We continue to see very strong growth in China, both domestically-produced and then imported-from-Europe product. That's all very, actually, helpful for us. And so no, no negative impact at all on the luxury stuff for us. It's been good, good and as kind of expected, John, is the way I would say.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, I mean, as we think about the share buybacks and the stock being down almost 4% today, would you consider getting a lot more aggressive with the share buybacks? I know you bought back a little bit in the first quarter, but given what were seeing on the stock and given the sort of the disbelief in what your earnings are going to be around forex, it seems like a good time to buy the stock. Would you consider accelerating the buyback dramatically?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Yes, we would accelerate the buyback. I think I said that actually in my script, that we anticipate acceleration going into the year, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from Itay Michaeli with Citi.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a couple of a -- it's just follow-up clarifications. So it's good to see that you've confirmed the 9.5% to 12% x currency revenue growth. I think in January, you laid out that of that the backlog was roughly, I think, 10% to 11.5%. Just wanted to clarify if that still is the case or if things kind of shifted around between the base business and the pricing assumptions within that.","Kenneth Lamb","Just about everything else is unchanged, little movement here and there. But that chart that we laid out for you in January is still intact, with the exception that foreign currency piece is now a much more dramatic impact.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And to that, is there any dollar amount of backlog that came in Q1 that you can share or just kind of timing of the launches of the backlog this year for -- to help us out.","Kenneth Lamb","We don't have a dollar amount for you, but -- and you should've gleaned from the comments, I think, that we think that we are probably a little bit behind where we thought we would be after the first quarter. But as we review the programs for the rest of the year, it seems that what we had lost in the first quarter's going to be recovered for the rest of the year.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's helpful, Ken, and then just 2 quick last ones. First, any change to the free cash flow guidance for the year, apologize if I missed it. And second, just any thoughts on the M&A environment in general and kind of what you're seeing out there?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Yes, Itay. We're going to adjust that guidance probably about $50 million down, and that's all driven by FX as well. Nothing on that's driving other than that.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, $50 million.","James R. Verrier","Itay, this is James. Just on the M&A environment, no real change from what we talked about in Detroit in January. We remain -- we've got a lot of work going on, got a lot of targets that were engaged with. And a lot of opportunities. Obviously, we're not announcing anything right now, but we continue to remain optimistic about M&A activity. And we're aggressively focused on it for sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.","Jacob W. Hughes - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","This is Jacob Hughes calling in for Joe. Just had a quick strategic question. I saw a competitor announce that they're working on an electric supercharger, which I think combines the benefit of a turbo and supercharger. But what are your thoughts on that? Is that going to be more prevalent, any update what you're doing in that area? Just...","James R. Verrier","Yes. We see -- we do see adoption of, we'll call it, generically electric turbos or electrically-assisted turbochargers. We do see that trend emerging. Not surprisingly, BorgWarner is engaged with most of the OEMs, if not all, that are working on that. And we expect that to be a key program for BorgWarner going forward. We do have production orders for BorgWarner on electrically-assisted turbochargers. We're not in a position to announce those details at this stage, but we do have orders in the back, so to speak. And we see a steady growth of it, and we feel very good about it. And just to give you the primary reason why, generally, all forms of electrically-assisted turbocharger require turbocharger know-how, power electronics know-how and motor know-how, and BorgWarner brings all 3 together in a very nice integrated system approach.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.","Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you just talk about the expected ramp from plus 3% organic growth in 1Q to the target range of 9.5% to 12% for the full year? What gives you the confidence you can ramp that strongly? And I definitely understand that 1Q was impacted by the pushout of the program launches. But I guess, what I'm still hazy on is that even if the impact to 1Q was temporal, how does that allow you to be on track for the full year? Can customers somehow make up for lost time by overproducing when the vehicle does launch?","Kenneth Lamb","That last point that you made is relevant, especially in the programs we were talking about in Asia. They absolutely can do that. And secondly, remember that this growth number that we're talking about has a baseline. And the baseline gets easier for us in the second half of the year. If you go back to 2014, the first half was a very strong year, especially in the areas that we've been discussing today, and it was much weaker in the second half. So for us to see outsized growth in the second half is easier because it's an easier comparison.","Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful. And then my last question is just on raw materials. Can you remind us what your biggest commodity exposures are, and then how the cost-sharing arrangements work with your customers? And any help you can give us in terms of how it could impact your results in 2015. And then sort of separately to that, but related, does some amount of the pressure on revenue relate to the cost-sharing as you pass savings on with no negative impact to EBIT?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Okay. So, Ryan, let's go back in time. There was -- a couple of years ago, we used to see headwinds of about $30 million in commodity prices, I think in '14 that came down to probably under $15 million. And then in 2015, it's coming down again as far as that year-over-year headwind. So it's come down to where, at this point this year, it's a much smaller number than it was 3 years ago. So with that said, this year, it's much, much less. And the commodities we're buying, we see copper, we see nickel, we see resins and we see steel. But steel comes in a lot of different areas. Now what I will say is this, this is a very complex discussion, because what happens is each one has different contracts and different timing periods. And some of it's pass-through and some of it's not. So for example, in nickel, we probably have pass-throughs of maybe","[Audio Gap]","enable to pass prices up and down the change -- chain, that it's not that materially of a headwind or tailwind for us on average. So it's a very complex question you're asking, but we are in an environment that's more positive. I will say that.","Operator","We have time for one final question, and that question comes from Richard Hilgert with MorningStar.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Over in China, we've seen vehicle license lotteries coming into play in a lot of large cities, primarily because of the smog issues. We've also seen the government over there incentivize a lot more for the electrified powertrains. I'm curious, are the OEs over there more interested in your","[Audio Gap]","than OEs in other parts of the world? Have they started to utilize these things more so than in other world regions?","James R. Verrier","Richard, I would summarize it this way. Our growth rate for BorgWarner in China remains on path to be, rough numbers, about a 30% CAGR over the next 5 years. And it remains very strong. I would say to you, the adoption of the BorgWarner technologies for fuel economy and emissions come in China. We've seen no pushout slowdown at all in China at the adoption rates. And all of our technologies in the product portfolio for BorgWarner are getting adopted. And if you think how that translates into new facilities that we've been building, whether it be Drivetrain-related or Engine-related, it really is very, very strong adoption. And that applies to both the domestic customers, Richard, as well as the global joint venture partners. So no slowdown and very rapid adoption rates of all of our technology over in China.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And Ron, I was wondering if you could tell me, we saw the percentage change in the operating segment income come down less so on the Engine side versus the percentage change in revenue than we did on the Drivetrain side. Was there anything about currency in there that may have affected the way that the operating -- the EBIT -- adjusted EBIT changed year-over-year?","Ronald T. Hundzinski","Okay. In my opening remarks, I gave some numbers around the comparable incremental or decremental numbers in those 2 segments. I did say that in the Drivetrain decremental, it was roughly 40-some-percent decremental, which was down -- I said, you've got to look at that segment because it's small numbers. So yes, I would say that the Drivetrain, I guess, is what you're getting at, probably was -- performed not as well, I guess, I would say, because of about $2 million. But it's small numbers, Richard. So yes, I think what you're getting at is the performance in the Drivetrain wasn't as impressive on the Engine side.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Well, either that, Ron, or there's something positive about the margin that a weak euro has provided for the Engine segment. And that's what I'm trying to figure is if engine, because of currency, might not be necessarily as unfavorable a margin decline or profitability decline simply because of the year-over-year change in currency. But it sounds like it's more of a negative impact on the Drivetrain side than it is a positive impact on Engine.","Kenneth Lamb","I think to sum it up, Richard, the Engine segment had a really good quarter. The Drivetrain segment is under a little bit more pressure, both on the revenue line and on the cost line, because we've got the restructuring inefficiencies, new plants and a lot of the revenue pressures that we talked about were more focused on Drivetrain than Engine. That's the good way to think about it.","Kenneth Lamb","I'd like to thank you, all, again, for joining us. We expect to file our 10-Q before the end of the day, which will provide details of our results. If you have any follow-up questions about our earnings release, the matters discussed during this call or our 10-Q, please direct them to me.

Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed here today. Now, moving on to our results James Verrier, President & CEO will comment on fourth quarter and full year results and current industry trends and then, Ron Hundzinski our CFO, will discuss the details of our operating results and also our outlook for 2013. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to James.","James Verrier","Thank you, Ken, and good day to everybody. Today, I\u2019m very pleased to review our fourth quarter and full year results, as well as our fourth quarter accomplishments. First off, I\u2019d like to congratulate all the BorgWarner employees on a truly outstanding 2012. You dedication to our customers and shareholders is reflected in the Company\u2019s strong performance for this year.","Now on to our results and I will start with the fourth quarter. Reported sales were $1.7 billion, flat from a year ago excluding the impact of foreign currencies and dispositions made in the last 12 months. U.S. GAAP earnings were $1.03 per share, but excluding the non-comparable items, earnings were $1.16per share. Our reported operating income margin was 9.9%, but again, as we exclude non-comparable items, our operating income margin was 10.9% in the quarter, and Ron will discuss the non-comparable items later.","Two key factors drove our results. First, our sales were impacted by a weak production environment, most notably live vehicles in Europe and commercial vehicles globally. And secondly strong operational efficiency and cost controls enabled us to post a solid operating margin despite challenging conditions.","By looking to the segments, first the Engine Group, fourth quarter sales were about $1.2 billion. That\u2019s down 2% from a year ago after excluding the impact of foreign currencies and dispositions made during the last 12 months. Our results were led by turbocharger growth in China, increased sales of BCT in Japan, but these positive results were offset significantly by the lower production volumes in Europe. ","At the Drivetrain Group, sales were about $560 million, and that\u2019s up 5% from the fourth quarter of 2011, excluding foreign currencies. Drivetrain\u2019s results were driven by increased all-wheel drive system sales in North America and India and we saw growth in traditional IT component sales in Korea, and this more than offset the lower production volumes in Europe.","Now let me move to the full year. Reported sales were just off $7.1 billion and after excluding the impact of foreign currencies and M&A activities, sales were up 6% from 2011 and this represents strong sales growth, considering the light vehicle production in Europe, a market which comprises nearly half of our sales was down 6%. U.S. GAAP earnings were $4.17 per share, but after we exclude the non-comparable items, net earnings were $4.97 per share, which is up 12% from 2011.","Our full year reported operating income margin was 10.5% or 11.7% as we exclude the non-comparable items. So in all three key metrics; sales, earnings and operating income margin; which hit all-time records in 2012, this is a tremendous accomplishment when we consider the weak market conditions in which it was achieved.","Now looking to the future, BorgWarner continues to invest for the long term. Our capital spending continues to grow. For the full year we spent about 5% of sales and we remain committed to supporting our future growth and productivity improvements. Our spending for R&D was about 3.9% of sales in the quarter and about 3.7% for the full year and we continue to trend towards our targeted level of 4% for R&D spending.","I\u2019m also proud to review some exciting announcements we made during the quarter. In November we reported an expected backlog of $2.3 billion of net new business for the years 2013 through \u201815, as demand for our advanced powertrain technologies remains very strong in the foreseeable future. BorgWarner supplies its three-stage turbocharger technology to BMW, for its M Performance diesel engine. The new engine is the most powerful six cylinder diesel engine in the world.","We also opened another production facility at our campus in Ningbo, China. This hi-tech facility will support engine timing and VCT components to support the launch of over 50 programs with 20 Chinese customers. The opening ceremony also celebrated the inauguration of BorgWarner\u2019s world class Ningbo Engineering Center which provides research and development, application engineering and management support.","Now I would like to review our current outlook for 2013 light vehicle production. We first announced our 2013 outlook at the Deutsche Bank\u2019s Automotive Conference in Detroit last month and our view is unchanged from that forecast. We expect total global production volumes to be up approximately 1% from 2012. In North America we expect production volumes to be up 2% from 2012. We expect Europe to be down 3%, China up 10%, and Japan down 10%.","In the commercial vehicle market, generally we expect stability in 2013, but not much growth. For most of the markets in which we participate, Europe, North America and China, we expect production to be flat compared with 2012. In Brazil however, we do see the potential for low double digit growth.","Finally, our sales and earnings guidance for 2013 also remains unchanged from our announcement last month. Our sales growth in 2013 is expected to be 2% to 6% or 3% to 7% when we exclude 2012 dispositions. Our 2013 earnings guidance is $5.15 to $5.45 per share and our operating margin is expected to be 11.5% or better for the year. I\u2019m confident 2013 will be another strong year for BorgWarner.","So as I mentioned before, 2012 was a tough year from a macro perspective. However, Borg Warner\u2019s financial results underscored our operational proficiency and our ability to manage cost during challenging times. And as we look ahead we see the outlook for our business remain strong. In2013 we expect to grow sales and profits for the fourth year in a row, with more growth to come in 2014 and beyond. No company in the auto sector is better positioned for long term profitable growth than Borg Warner. The industry\u2019s adoption of leading edge Powertrain technology will continue for years and because of this I feel very, very good about the Company\u2019s future.","So with that now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Ron. Thank you.","Ron Hundzinski","Thanks James and good day everyone. Before I begin reviewing the financials, I would like to put BorgWarner\u2019s performance into perspective within the broader auto industry. Global light vehicle production was up 1% in the fourth quarter,, compared with the same quarter last year. BorgWarner\u2019s reported sales were down 3% from a year ago, but as James explained earlier, if we exclude the impact of foreign currencies and M&A activity in 2011-2012, our sales in the quarter were flat with last year. To get a clear picture of our performance relative to the market, we need to review the light vehicle and commercial vehicle market separately. ","First let's take a closer look at the light vehicle market from a regional perspective. In Asia, which I'm defining as China, Korea and Japan, light vehicle production was up 6%. Our light vehicle sales in Asia excluding currency was up 13%. In Europe, light vehicle production was down around 11% in the quarter, our light vehicle sales excluding currency and 2011 and 2012 disposals were down 4%. In North America, light vehicle production was up 8%., our light vehicle sales growth in North America growth was about 10%, slightly better than the market.","Now, let\u2019s review the commercial vehicle market. The fourth quarter saw continued weakness in the commercial vehicle markets around the world. Commercial vehicle production in Brazil and China were sharply lower, while North America and Europe were basically flat. As a result our commercial vehicle sales were down 10% in the quarter.","So to summarize, our typical outperformance of the light vehicle markets was intact in Asia and Europe in the fourth quarter. Despite outperforming the market in Europe, the 11% volume decline in that market had a meaningful impact on our total company growth in the quarter. Weak commercial vehicle markets around the world resulted in a 10% sales decline for us in a segment representing nearly 20% of our business.","Moving down, working down the income statement, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 20% for the quarter. That\u2019s down slightly from 20.3% a year ago, but includes about $2 million to $3 million of higher raw material prices. SG&A expenses were 9.1% of sales in the quarter, versus 8.3% of sales in the fourth quarter of last year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in R&D spending, which as a percentage of sales was 3.9% in the fourth quarter 2012, up 50 basis points from a year ago.","Reported operating income in the quarter was a $171 million. However this includes $17 million of related retirement obligations. There were two parts to this charge. The first part is a $6 million loss related to partial settlement of a pension obligation associated with our now-closed Drivetrain facility in Muncie Indiana. The second part is $11 million charge related to the Company\u2019s decision to wave the forfeiture provisions of an existing stock grants made to certain retiring name executive officers.","Excluding the $17 million charge, operating income was $188 million or 10.9% of sales compared with $213 million or 12% of sales on a comparable basis a year ago. About the half of the 110 basis point decline in margin is related to higher R&D spending as I mentioned before. The rest of the margin decline is primarily related to typical cost pressures including the inflation and price downs to customers which we usually offset with growth related income but were unable to do so in a challenging environment for growth in the fourth quarter. After excluding the impact of foreign currency and non-comparable items in both these quarters and the fourth quarter of 2011, our incremental margin was not measurable as we have lower operating income and flat sales.","As you look further down to income statement, equity and affiliate earnings was $10 million in the quarter, flat with last year. This represents the performance of NSK-Warner, our 50-50 joint venture in Japan, which sells transmission components to our Japanese customers in Japan and China, as well as TEL, our turbocharger joint venture in India.","Interest expense and finance charges were $7 million in the quarter, down from $17 million a year ago. This was primarily due to the maturity of our convertible debt settlement with treasury shares in mid-April. Note that this reduction in convertible related interest expense did not impact earnings per share. We have been calculating EPS on an if-converted basis from the first quarter of 2010 until the securities matured in April 2012.","Provision for income taxes was $48 million in the quarter, which is a 28% effective tax rate. However the provision included two items. The first is a $6 million tax benefit associated with the retirement related obligations I mentioned earlier and $3 million of net-unfavorable tax adjustments which included the closure of certain tax audits and other tax assets no longer viable. Excluding these items, our tax expense was $51 million in the quarter or a run rate effective tax rate of just under 26%. For the full year, our run rate effective tax rate was 26.8% in line with our guidance of 27%.","Net earnings attributable to non-controlling interest was $5.4 million in the quarter, up slightly from $5.2 million a year ago. This line item reflects our minority partners share in the earnings performance of our Korean and Chinese consolidated joint ventures.","Let\u2019s go back to earnings per share, which was $120 million in the quarter, net earnings or a $1.03 per share, on a reported basis. On a comparable basis, net earnings were $136 million in the quarter, or $1.16 per share, slightly down from $1.19 per share a year ago.","That's a 3% decline in earnings per share on flat sales, good performance for the company concerning the challenging market conditions and in line with our guidance provided last October. Also note that foreign currency reduced earnings per share by about $0.02 in the quarter.","As James mentioned 2012 was a record year for sales, earnings and operating income on a comparable basis. Additionally, our four year incremental margin was 17% excluding the impact of foreign currency in 2011 and 2012 dispositions. This is excellent performance concerning the weak market conditions in which it was achieved.","Now let's take a closer look at the operating groups. Engine group sales were just under $1.2 billion in the quarter. Excluding currency in 2011 and 2012 dispositions, Engine Group sales were down 2% compared with the fourth quarter of 2011. Adjusted EBIT for the Engine group was $182 million in the quarter or 15.6% of sales. That's down from 16.3% adjusted EBIT margin reported a year ago.","The year-over-year detrimental margin excluding currency in 2011 and 2012 dispositions was about 80% but this is below our typical results but distorted by a couple of very unique items. The higher R&D spend as I mentioned before was almost entirely in the Engine group.","The investment for the long term was required despite the weak market conditions that impacted our sales in the quarter. We also had a customer-specific issue in our North American commercial vehicle business as well. For the full year, the Engine group\u2019s adjusted EBIT margin was 16% and that\u2019s an all-time record for the Engine group. In the Drivetrain group sales were about $516 million in the quarter. Excluding currency Drivetrain group sales were up 5% compared with the fourth quarter 2011.","On a reported basis, adjusted EBIT was $49 million or 8.8% of sales, in line with the fourth quarter 2011. The year-over-year incremental margin for the Drivetrain group excluding currency was about 6%. The year-over-year variances in the Drivetrain group\u2019s financials were very small, a $2 million improvement in operating income over $26 million improvement in sales.","When the variances are that small, minor changes in the business can have a meaningful impact on the incremental margin calculation. For the full year, the Drivetrain Group\u2019s adjusted EBIT margin was 9.1%, which was on target with our guidance of 9% or better.","Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow, if you look at the balance sheet and cash flow, we generated about $879 million of net cash from operating activities in 2012. That\u2019s up a 171 million from 2011 and was driven by a strong focus on working capital management, that generated that extra cash flow.","Capital spending was $407 million in 2012, up $13 million from the same period a year ago. Our capital spending is required to support our program launches around the world and in particularly Asia, South America, Eastern Europe and Mexico. Free cash flow during the period which we define as net cash from operating activities less capital spending including tooling was $472 million.","Looking at the balance sheet itself, balance sheet debt decreased by $262 million, compared with the end of 2011. Cash increased by $356 million during the same period. This $618 million decrease in net debt was primarily due to net cash provided by operating activities and the maturity of our convertible debt, partially offset by share repurchases. We spent just under $300 million to repurchase 4.2 million shares in 2012 including 1.5 million shares in the fourth quarter.","At the end of the year, our net debt to capital ratio was 10%, compared with 28.3% at the end of 2011. Net debt-to-EBITDA at the end of 2012 on a trailing 12 month basis was 0.3 times. Our capital structure remains in excellent shape.","Now moving on to 2013 guidance, now I like to discuss more of the details in the 2013 guidance which is basically unchanged from what we provided last month. James reviewed our guidance at a high level but I'll go in more finer points here. Our sales growth expectations of 2% to 6% or 3% to 7% excluding 2012 dispositions assumes no currency impact. We recognize that the euro is trending stronger than the original guidance of $1.28 to \u20ac1 but conversely the Japanese yen is trending weaker than we expected. If currencies remain unchanged from today's spot rates, we will see some benefit primarily due to the strength of the euro. We expect raw material inflation of $15 million to $20 million in 2013, down from just under $30 million in 2012. ","As James mentioned earlier, our operating income margin is expected to be 11.5% or better in 2013, similar to our 2012 margins. In other words, despite sales growth below typical 8% to 10% we need to maintain margins we expect to come very close to the maintaining margins this year. Slower sales growth would mean less incremental income to offset the inflationary cost pressures, but we expect to supplement our incremental income with increased productivity gains and spending controls.","Our expected tax rate of approximately 27% for 2013 is in part based unassumed level of cash repatriation from foreign operations. If our cash repatriation strategy is modified, our tax rate could trend slightly higher. We will provide quarterly updates on this as we progress through the year.","Our diluted share count at the end of 2012 was approximately a 117 million shares. This is the proximate share count and which our guidance is based. Any dilution from equity based compensation in 2013 is assumed to be offset by the share repurchases and any additional share repurchase that we may execute over the course of the year are not factored in our guidance.","So in conclusion we continue to be confident in our ability to execute in any market. This company has demonstrated a heightened focus on efficiency and cost controls since the 2009 recession. This focus resulted in highly efficient growth in record margins in each of the last three years. Weak market conditions, particularly in Europe will likely result in sales growth, below our long term trend in 2013.","Despite this 2013 should be another year of record sales and record profits for BorgWarner. Over the long term we tend to execute our growth strategy and over the short term remain focused on efficiency regardless of the directions in market.","With that, I would like to turn the call over back to Ken.","Ken Lamb","Thanks Ron. Now let\u2019s move to the Q&A portion of the call. I\u2019ll ask the call coordinator to please announce the Q&A procedure.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities.","Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities","Ron, in terms of the guide, I know unchanged for the year but Europe is going to be down pretty significantly in terms of production in the first quarter. I know you don\u2019t give quarterly guidance but just generally speaking, how should we think about the cadence or the earning performance as the year goes on?","Ron Hundzinski","I would say that it\u2019s incrementally improving throughout the year Rich. So, every quarter-on-quarter, it\u2019s improving.","Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. Is that a kind of a sequential comment on an EPS line sequentially improving?","Ron Hundzinski","Yes.","Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay all right. And then anything from a mix standpoint that we should be aware of as it relates to your brother parts of your world. I know your European mix got worse as 2012 progressed. What\u2019s the assumption there for \u201913 as it relates to that?","James Verrier","As we look out into the year, we are seeing not a significant change in mix as we are looking out. As we come towards the end of last the high end higher contented vehicles kind of caught up a little bit as the year progressed. Now, we have got that assumption into our guidance and we feel pretty comfortable that that mix level is not going to shift too significantly. So that\u2019s what we are seeing it right now.","Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities","And then just on the consumer reports article from a week or a so ago, as you are probably aware they came out with some negative comments about the benefits of turbochargers and the OEMs have kind of backed the performance, in terms of what they have seen but what are your thoughts on that I mean. I can imagine, I know your stance is but just what\u2019s your thoughts on the report and are you aware of any key differences in terms of the testing or any color you could share on your thoughts, would be helpful?","James Verrier","Yes, we are fully aware of it obviously, Rich and I would say with any of those types of reports, we take them seriosuly. We simply don\u2019t want to dismiss them or anything like that. So we do take a hard look at anything like that, particularly when it relates obviosuly to one of our core products. But I think there is a couple of keypoints here in that specific report. It's very difficult to get a sense of what the testing and driving conditions that are associated with the results, that are coming out of that report and as you know Rich and I think everybody else kind of gets it that you can get variations in the results that you get depending on what test cycle you use, what type of driving behaviour, actually indepndent of any technology. At a simple level though our view is almost every indicator we look at towards turbocharger penetration continues to be very strong and we see that in our clothing activity, we see it in our net new book of business.","We\u2019re not seeing any slowdown in adoption rates, we\u2019re not seeing any slowdown in activity and interest levesls from customers and I think that's just driven by, from our view that the fundamentals of turbochargers remain extremly solid. It\u2019s a key technology to help the engineer's downsize their engines and get the type of fuel economy that we need and we have seen that success all around the world for many, many years and we just see that trend continuing on.","So in a nutshell, we pay attention to the report, but we pay attention to all of those reports and there\u2019s a aweful lot of them that are very postive about turbocharger performance and adoption rates. So hopefully that helps you a little bit Rich.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Ceraso with Credit Suisse.","Chris Ceraso- Credit Suisse","","Maybe just a follow up on that James. I think the big picture is the difference between what the EPA says fuel economy is versus what real world driving is and as you point out it\u2019s not just turbo it\u2019s a host of different technology's but I wonder if the EPA sort of figures this out and says, we need more realistic testing procedures and when those stickers numbers end up coming down a little bit. Does that threaten at all, what you think car companies would be willing to pay for certain technologies? Had there been a link in the past, where I said okay if I had a turbo I am going to get a 15% bump in my window sticker number. Maybe now it\u2019s only 10%, so I\u2019m not going to pay as much for turbo. So do you think that's a risk?","James Verrier","In a nutshell Chris, I don\u2019t see that as a risk. I think there is always a discussion around the real world driving conditions and the stated conditions, as I've said independent of technology. So I don\u2019t see that as a risk to us and we remain very comfortable as we work with the OEMs and they go through all the testing and validation that they go through and the date of the debt scene is still consistently driving towards the type of technologies that BorgWarner has in the profile. So we're not seeing this as a significant risk to BorgWarner at all Chris.","Chris Ceraso - Credit Suisse","","Okay, so even OEM data supports the improvement, so they're willing to go for the technology?","James Verrier","","Yes absolutely. That's why we continue to see the adoption rates and penetration rates of the BorgWarner type products that we offer.","Chris Ceraso - Credit Suisse","Okay. And then a follow up again for Ron about the progression of earnings through the year. Not to get too cute, but typically your cadence is roughly 50% first half, 50% back half. Do you expect this year it'll be more like 40-60 or can you give us some bands around first half versus back half?","Ron Hundzinski","So we're talking sequentially, right Chris? First of all, I'd have to go back and take a look at some numbers here. I would say it's more rated to the back half of the year. I wouldn\u2019t say its 50-50, okay. I'd say it\u2019s more backend weighted than it is front weighted.","Chris Ceraso - Credit Suisse","Right, of course. The question is normally you're 50-50. Is this year going to be more like 40% first half, 60% back half? How tilted is it, is the question.","Ron Hundzinski","It's not material. I guess I'll say it that way. There's going to be slight difference but it's not material.","Chris Ceraso - Credit Suisse","Okay, and then just lastly on the incremental margins, Drivetrain you commented was pretty low sub 10%. What's your expectation there for 2013?","Ron Hundzinski","You know our guidance on total company is 11.5% plus or better, right, very similar to what we saw in 2012. I would suggest that operating margins within those segments would be relatively similar as well in 2013 as they were in 2012.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Spak with RBC Capital Markets.","Joe Spak - RBC Capital Markets","","Is there any update on - I know in the past you've talked about being able to flex down in Europe on some of the temporary workers. Can you give us just the latest metrics there and what you see on card?","James Verrier","Yes sure. Let me talk through that. Just a quick recap is - where we were last year was, we were in the mid 20's type number and to clarify that, temporary employees as a percentage of total direct temporary employees. So we were in the mid 20's in the second quarter and as we explained, I think in the past that we would come down to a high single digits, that type of range. That's fairly much where we at. So we may be in the 10%, 12%, 13% type range of temps as we are going into the year and we think that's a pretty good number for us if there is any further erosion.","Just to add another comment onto that though, as we look around the world we are still seeing growth in all parts of the world from a BorgWarner perspective. And the production volumes may be down but from a BorgWarner perspective we are still seeing growth in every region of the world. So we feel good that we got that 10% to 15% type number of temporary employees in place.","And then any updated thoughts on the cash, the free cash flow guidance is again strong for 13. The cash bounce builds quite quickly. So now I know you talked about repatriating cash. That would lead me to believe its maybe not as M&A focused as in the past. Can you just provide any more color there?","I would not say it\u2019s not M&A focused. I think that is our number one focus as M&A. I am very much aware where my balance sheet is and where the cash and like I demonstrated in the fourth quarter, I am being very proactive in addressing that with the share repurchases. So that flexibility still continues for me but we are very much M&A focused on where the cash needs to be.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc Securities.","Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc Securities","Two questions for you. First of all, with regards to production, there is probably some concern that European production is going to be done in the first quarter. My question is as you talk to your customers about Europe in particular with regards to first quarter production schedules, with regards to full year production schedules, do you sense a particular bias towards the upside or the downside? I think everybody is surprised that fourth quarter came in better than expected. I am wondering what's the first quarter shaping up like.","Ron Hundzinski","Let me take a shot at that Brett and talk about the yearend first of all and the 3% down for light vehicle production in Europe that we talked about a few weeks ago and we still feel good about that number. We feel pretty comfortable and I would say as we have rolled through the first couple of weeks here in the year, where it\u2019s off to a decent start, there is nothing we have seen in our January run rates and as we go into February run rates that would make us feel uncomfortable at all. We feel good about where we were at from a run rate prospective, from where were say five or six weeks ago.","I think if you take it in a slightly broader prospective, it seems to me that the range of guidance on European light vehicle production seems to have narrowed a little bit. I think people were talking some fairly large spreads of what it could be a couple of months ago and that seems to be narrowing a little bit. So the bottom line that we feel pretty good where we were at from a guide of the 3% down.","Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc Securities","And Ron can you maybe provide a little bit more color on your expectations for share repurchases. I mean over the past 10 to 15 years as I\u2019ve covered you, you have never really been an aggressive re-purchaser of shares and this past quarter you\u2019ve have gone out and brought 1.5 million shares and you always have a very good balance sheet. I know your priority is to grow the business and make acquisitions and so forth but I\u2019m wondering, what are your expectations for share repurchase over the next year or two years or something along those lines?","Ron Hundzinski","We have never announced a formal program as you know and the way I would say this is that the M&A activities are not always at a schedule that you would like to have the transactions down right, every year so much. So, as our cash starts to build on the balance sheet, I am very much aware of the leveraging issue we have on our balance sheet, which then says I need to be much more proactive in those periods where the M&A activity is slower and then I have to return capital issues using the flexibility of share repurchases.","So what I would say is that I use share repurchases in the periods of time where the M&A activity is not being able to close a transaction. It gives me the flexibility to still maintain or return of capital strategy for our investors while the M&A activities that we do internally continue. Does that help you?","Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc Securities","Is there any particular metric or threshold that you kind of use as a guide to say look if I got X amount of cash or X leverage ratio and I start to dip beyond a certain point, I\u2019m going to use that access money to repurchase shares?","Ron Hundzinski","There are several things that go on Brett that I look at internally. We do some valuation modeling ourselves internally for the company. So I get a basis from where I think the value should be. We take a look at the stock prices as well. We know where we\u2019re at on our M&A activity. So, it\u2019s not just a one item. I look at several items that\u2019s going on at a given time and we make decisions based on that. We have a targeted net debt to equity ratio and all that. We've been higher in the mid-20s in the past but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s one metric that I use to determine what I\u2019m going to do when I do it. It\u2019s several factors.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Pat Nolan - Deutsche Bank","","It\u2019s actually Pat Nolan for Rob. Just a couple of questions. First on the cost side and I apologize because I missed the first part of this, where are you expecting R&D to sales to be for the full year in 2013? And as we\u2019re looking further out is to a potential production recovery in 2014, you are doing a really good job this year of controlling costs, actually keeping flat margins without the historic high single digit growth you\u2019ve said you needed to have to maintain margins. Does that imply the incremental in the eventual production recovery won't be as high as historic because the costs will come back a little bit faster.","James Verrier","","Let me answer the first question first on the R&D spend. We have always stated that our targeted percent to sales of R&D spend is 4% and we are at the 3.9% in the fourth quarter and I would say that our target still is the 4%. Now can you go through that second part, it\u2019s kind of long question, exactly what you are trying to get at the second part of your question?","Pat Nolan - Deutsche Bank","","I apologize. So this year you are doing a very good job of controlling costs, and as a result your able to maintain margins with lower growth than you\u2019ve historically needed to achieve flat margins. So in the eventual production recovery that we could see in \u201814, \u201815, does that mean your incremental margins would be lower than your historic level because the costs would come back a little bit faster?","James Verrier","No, okay I see what question is. As we start to get growth again on the top line, my incremental margin will be in that 20ish range plus or minus. That's where you could expect our margin, that's where we drive our businesses at that 20% range.","Pat Nolan - Deutsche Bank","","Okay that cost cutting measures that you\u2019re taking in 2013, we shouldn\u2019t view those as kind of temporary measures that eventually that cost us to come back?","James Verrier","I wouldn\u2019t classify as cost reductions. I would classify them more as cost controls. I guess there is a difference. What we would do is we would defer certain investments at times. It\u2019s not that I am taking costs necessary out. Now with that said we are being more productive. I\u2019m not going to discount the productivity side of it but that's just normal work. So we're not taking our people and cost right now, we're just being very prudent on many line items in our expense reports as far as where we want to put investments in the short term and what we can defer as far as investments. So it's more cost controls than cost reductions.","Pat Nolan - Deutsche Bank","","And if I could just sneak one more in, can you give us a rule of thumb for your yen sensitivity to the top line and how it flows through the margin?","James Verrier","","We have a facility in Japan and it's not a significant portion of our exposure quite frankly, but it can impact us and we just pointed out because it is a sizeable operation we have up there, it\u2019s 20% (ph) of sales.","Ron Hundzinski","3.5%","James Verrier","Yes 3.5% of sales.","","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of David Leiker with Robert W. Baird & Company.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Company","","I want to take a cut at this quarterly numbers on a different fashion. And as we are hearing a lot of comments that some of those production cuts you saw in December, particularly with Audi carried over into the first quarter of January. As we look at Q4 to Q1 what things do you think are different? Weather is about the same, seasonality is about the same. What things do you think are different that make Q1 different than what we saw in Q4?","Ron Hundzinski","You're referring to the market?","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Company","Your earnings.","Ron Hundzinski","Oh, earnings. What I would say is that obviously the top line sequentially has to be looked at very closely, right? Going through the cost structure side of it, I think we managed our gross profit margin fairly well. We're down 30 basis points year-over-year. I would suspect that we can maintain decent gross profit margins as well going sequentially. If you go further down the SG&A line items and corporate charges, there were some, what I would call some investments in the fourth quarter that may be increased to spend in the corporate line items and SG&A, especially the R&D spend. Maybe that would back to more normalized spend level. David, did I help you?","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Company","Great that's useful. And then just to circle back on the turbocharger thing, I think some of what is going around in the market here, are people, I think consumer reports is comparing a 1.6 liter normally aspirated engine with 1.6 liter turbocharged engine and I think James in that scenario, the fuel economy differences may not be that great. What the real opportunity for, the turbos are doing 1.2 turbocharged engine versus a 1.6 liter. Is that some of the misunderstanding that's going on here?","James Verrier","That could well be David. Your example there is a good one. Not to keep repeating myself but I think the key here is the fundamentals of what we're doing with turbochargers is generally to enable the downsizing of the engine and maintain similar levels of performance and get good fuel economy, and that fundamental still remains intact and we've got this test data out there with this consumer report and it's very easy to mix and match and not draw the appropriate conclusion. ","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Company","What is the fuel efficiency gain, on a 1.6 liter versus a 1.6 liter turbo? It's single digit percentages isn't it?","James Verrier","Well first of all I don\u2019t want to comment for Ford, David on that particular thing. They would be better because it can depend on the whole issue, the calibration of the engine and what other technologies they are utilizing on that engine. So I don't want to comment specifically for Ford on that 1.6 application.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Company","Okay, I was just talking generically. And then onto Europe on the truck side, there is a Euro 6 emission change here at the start of 2014. I guess two questions, one, does Euro 6 present a content opportunity for you, as you look to 2014 and secondly what are your thoughts of whether there's a pre-buy there or not that may push off launches of 2014 Euro 6 engines?","James Verrier","The first part David I think, as we migrate to Euro 6, in general that will help us as they adopt more technology to that level of engine. So that at a general level will help BorgWarner. In terms of a kind of pre-buy for it, as we get through \u201813 ahead of \u201914, I don't think that's going to be significant for us. We're actually showing Europe year-over-year about flat for commercial vehicle. So not significant or material for us in terms of pre-buy but Euro 6 does help us a little bit from a technology perspective.","","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli - Citigroup.","","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup","","Just want to back to cash deployment. Ron you mentioned M&A is still a top priority but typically when the environment isn't as active, you go out and buy back more stocks. So is it fair to characterize the current environment as not particularly active in terms of what you're seeing out there in M&A and if so why, maybe you could just talk about the M&A landscape a little bit and what you're seeing out there, what's available out there and so on.","Ron Hundzinski","I would not say that M&A activity is not active, it's extremely active. What I was referring to is that the bill that closed transaction currently in the environment, we're a little bit behind paced that would like quite frankly, but I would not say that the activity level is any lower than it ever has been. In fact it's I would say increased in some way. So, if I said that the activity was decreasing I didn't mean to say it that way.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup","Okay that's helpful, that's good to hear, and then just in terms of a couple of housekeeping items. Just help us in terms of how to think about interest expense in \u201813, is Q4 a good run rate and then also depreciation, amortization?","Ron Hundzinski","Interest rate I say, I would say it that what you saw on the end of the fourth quarter is a good run rate going forward, and depreciation and amortization is on a full year basis, has been around that 4% of sales. I think it was slightly higher in the fourth quarter but I think you're going to have to look at it, on a total year basis, it's at 4%.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup","That's helpful and then just lastly as we strupping (ph) up our euro sensitivities, can you remind us what, how the European operating margin fee looks relative to the corporate average?","Ron Hundzinski","They're the same so we're trying to understand what the margin impact would be on a change on the Euro, I would use the corporate average.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Colin Lengen with UBS.","Rahul Chadha - UBS","This is Rahul Chadha on behalf of Colin. Could you provide us a little more color on what's driving the strong growth in all wheel drive and is this becoming the story for the Drivetrain business going forward?","James Verrier","It's a couple of things that are going on. Well first of all, it's a critical part of our growth plan and we're very confident about the growth opportunities for the all-wheel drive segment. It's a couple of things that we're benefiting from, (inaudible) content in the North American market is strong as we've seen growth and recovery in the north America market, and our acquired business, the Haldex business from a coupling perspective has also seen significant growth in different parts of the world. So both if you like both parts of the all-wheel drive segment for us, both couplings and transfer cases have seen growth in the region and some incremental gains.","Rahul Chadha - UBS","Sorry, what sort of credential does it have to outperform the industry productions sort of over the next couple of years.","James Verrier","","I would say there's probably a little more opportunity on the coupling side of the business for us versus the transfer case side of the business, but as we look at it, our long term projection, we some level of outperformance on the transfer case business and the coupling business offers us very good opportunities as we look forward?","Rahul Chadha - UBS","And then one housekeeping outcome, the corporate expense of $33 million seemed like it was up quite notably year-over-year. Could you help us understand what drove that? ","Ron Hundzinski","It was up about $8 million year-over-year. I actually look at the sequential but I'll address the year-over-year. It's a whole host of items everything from a little bit of a, we put our advanced engineering expenses in corporate. R&D expenditures related to our segments, stay in the segment. So we had increased R&D spend, we had some foreign corporate offices, primarily in Germany and in Shanghai, China that we've been adding talent to as well, but it's basically a whole host of miscellaneous items there.","Rahul Chadha - UBS","And is this a good rate to model going forward.","Ron Hundzinski","What, from the fourth quarter or from which period?","Rahul Chadha - UBS","From the fourth quarter.","Ron Hundzinski","I would say the fourth quarter's pretty much in line where you could expect it going forward, change a few million here and there but it's not way off.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley","I only have a couple of housekeeping items left and one bigger picture question. You said you had a customer-specific issue in the quarter. Has that been resolved or is that going to continue for another quarter as well?","James Verrier","Ravi this is driven by a commercial vehicle customer that had some technology changes that they were going through that affected us without really naming the customer.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley","I have no idea who you're talking about, but anyway.","James Verrier","I don't want to name the customer Ravi but,\u2026","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley ","I understood,","James Verrier","That's just the volume it's a volume related issue, I'll say it that way, not a cost side.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley ","Got it.","James Verrier","Volume related in other words, they're changing technologies.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley ","But is that expected to persist into next year as well?","James Verrier","It's related to a year over year comparable issue. I think the run rate on this customer will stay where it's at but on a comparable basis it becomes an issue for us.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley ","Okay understood. And speaking of CV you said that was 20% of your revenues, that's a bit higher than normal I think. It\u2019s usually in the 16% level. So is there something going on. Is it because the European light vehicle business is still week or have your CV business run rate kind of step up little bit.","James Verrier","Let me clarify that Ravi. Commercial vehicle is about 16%, 15%. Aftermarket makes up that difference up to 20%. I kind of used 20% because I combined the two of them together because a good portion of our aftermarket really is Commercial Vehicle.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley ","And what exactly was your share count at the end of the quarter.","Ron Hundzinski","117.4.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley ","Okay so similar to the fourth quarter average. And finally a bigger picture question. When you look at R3S turbo versus R2S, what are the advantages of using R3S and do you see that as being more of a niche product with these high performance diesels or do you think it becomes more widespread?","James Verrier","Ravi, my sense right now, it'll start out as more of a niche product. I mean if you look at the application that we're utilizing it on, with BMW, it'll start out as more of a niche application but we will have the potential to grow and I guess the reason I feel pretty comfortable about that is that was the same story with R2S. If you go back many years ago, that was applied to a niche application and it became a little bit more mainstream.","Now will it become a large part of the turbo segment, probably not but what it does do is obviously enables us to support customers our customers with specific cut niche applications such as this BMW M6 that we're talking about with R3. The other follow on comment I would make is as the technology leader which we absolutely view ourselves as in turbochargers, it's another good example for us to utilize some of our new and breakthrough technology which the R3S is a good example of that.","Ron Hundzinski","Hey Ravi, it\u2019s Ron. I just wanted to correct something. I told you it was 117.4. It was actually 117.8. So this 400,000 share difference there, just want to correct my number.","","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Stover with Guggenheim Securities.","Matt Stover - Guggenheim Securities","","One the assets that were sold, were they a favorable contributor to income or neutral or did they distract last year?","Ron Hundzinski","Neutral.","Operator","","We have time for one final question, and that question comes from the line of Brian Sponheimer with Gabelli & Company.","Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company","Just a question on the luxury automakers as they get more evolved in some of the entry level luxury markets or luxury platforms with the COA class and the One series. How do you guys view this penetration in North America? Is it a good thing for you or is it something that could potentially dilute some of your higher content on some of your larger vehicles if consumers trade down in size?","James Verrier","I would say in general it's good for us. And as we look at the luxury guys bringing those types of vehicles in, our sense is that the adoption rates of the touch technologies that we have, whether it be turbochargers or other products will be strong. So we see that as favorable.","Ken Lamb","I'd like to thank you all again for joining us. We expect to file our 10-K before the end of the day, which will provide details of our results.

As Ken said, Ron and I are really pleased to share our results from the second quarter with you and also talk about what the rest of the year looks like. ","What I\u2019d like to do is, just start and make a few high-level comments on some of the bigger picture perspective as we look out into the macro industry or the macro environment in our industry and you can see a couple of points here on Slide 2 for those following along. ","I think the theme I would talk the most to in terms of the macro view is the notion of uncertainty out there out there in the world. And whether that\u2019s some of the civil unrest issues that we see particularly in Europe. ","We see tense political environment recently in Turkey, Middle East, pending U.S. elections and of course fairly recently the Brexit vote. All of that creates, I think, we all realize a sense of uncertainty at a macro view. ","But interestingly, when I look at the world of autos, we\u2019ve generally seen a pretty stable steady as you go type environment and things playing out pretty much as we had expected. ","And as we look forward, I think that macro uncertainty will continue, but I do see the auto sides remaining fairly stable. And as I articulate that a little further and talk to you about the market outlook, first of all from a light-vehicle perspective, I would say from a BorgWarner viewpoint, we are pretty well aligned with IHS. ","We see the China market growing in that mid single-digit 5% to 6% type range. We see Europe in a 2% to 3% growth environment range, and we see the US in that 2% to 3% range of growth, the light-vehicle production. ","We do see and we acknowledge that the US plateau, its effect is certainly on the horizon and we are very mindful of that. From a commercial vehicle point of view, we still see that space challenged for sure and as you look around globally, that there is really not a lot of growth at all and we do see some pretty continued strong weakness around off-road. ","Some of that translates into a lot of new programs under further review and consideration. So as I look at that, I would like to share with you, what are the leading indicators or the areas of watch for us as a company at BorgWarner and the ones that can be most relevant to us. ","So I would characterize the North American market, how is the plateau going to play out, how is the inventory production level is going to play out and we pay good attention to that. ","And I\u2019ll talk about how these relate to our guidance shortly. VW remains a critical customer and a very important customer for us and we have to monitor the share for VW around the world. ","And like everybody, we are going to pay attention to the potential impacts of volumes in Europe in light of Brexit and we will obviously monitor the commercial vehicle weakness. ","Now all that said, I would say, so fast things have absolutely planned up for our guidance and as you'll see in the guidance going forward, we still feel good about our guidance and we are building these in and going forward with good guidance. So, yes, we are watching, but we are also performing as expected and we expect to perform strongly going forward. ","Let me comment a little on the regulatory or the technology aspects of the business. First thing I would say to you is, the pull and the drive for fuel economy and emissions regulations, absolutely unchanged and the pull for powertrain technology remains as strong as it did last quarter, the quarter before that and the quarter before that. ","So we are not seeing any slowdown in customer engagement and programs that are driving and pulling advanced technology as we go forward. We do see the strong shift to increase powertrain electrification continues and we know that because we are right in the middle of it and we are talking to customers literally every day around the world in terms of working with them on solutions for them in that additional electrification content. ","That applies across the board. That is 48 volt architectures, it\u2019s all the hybrids and it\u2019s electric vehicles and we have content and discussion there and not just for the long-term, but products in the short run as well. ","I would say also relative to electrification our quoting activity remains very strong, multiple customers, multiple products, and we will be making further announcements on specific programs in the coming weeks and months. ","But I would just say this, I feel very pleased and very happy where we are at in terms of the level of engagement around new technology aligned with electrification. And as Ken alluded to in his opening comments, we plan to showcase a lot of those products, a lot of those technologies at our upcoming Investor Day on September 7. So let me kind of give us some high-level view here on the BorgWarner summary and let me start off with Q2. ","And needless to say Ron is going to provide a lot more detail and commentary in his comments. But I would just say this we had a really good quarter. I was very pleased with our second quarter. The growth came in at the high-end of our guidance and we delivered strong operating performance. ","Breaking that down a little further, it was $2.3 billion in sales, which is up 3.5% when we exclude FX and Remy. Regionally, it came in about as we had expected, which really was characterized by stronger growth in North America, and a particularly strong quarter in Korea, which was balanced with the lower growth as we had expected in Europe and China. ","EPS came in at $0.84 a share when we exclude non-comparables and that does include Remy. Operating margin 12.4% when we exclude Remy, 13.2%, the word I would use is impressive. ","Breaking that down by segment, engine sales $1.4 billion, so we grew at about 2.2% on a reported basis, or 2.8% when we exclude currency. Primary drivers of the engine growth were Turbo and Variable Cam Timing. ","Switching to drivetrain, sales of $895 million, that\u2019s almost 43% but when we exclude currency and Remy still a good quarter of 5.4% growth. Largest part of the growth came from strong all-wheel drive sales in both North America and also in Europe. ","So let me shift gears and talk a little bit about the outlook for 2016, and again Rob will provide more color on this. Basically, we\u2019ve narrowed our guidance range to the high-end of our previous range, which we think is very good news. ","We also have highlighted through the last couple of quarters four major launches this year that we\u2019ve talked about that are very critical to our success in the second half of the year. And just to remind you folks, it was the Pentastar Engine, Ford Scorpion, Ford Super Duty, and the GM Duramax. ","All of these programs have launched except the Duramax which will launch in September. And I would say to you that the launches have been probably slower than the original assumptions, but here is the good news, this is exactly what we had anticipated and planned for in our guidance back in January. That\u2019s why we did it and as a result of that, our launch activity remains on track. ","So the outlook on the second half of the year, if I talk about that, I would characterize it to you that I think our risks and our opportunities are pretty well balanced. I alluded earlier in my comments, there are some risks and some watchpoints out there but I also see some positive aspects too and in general, I see what balanced and with that that\u2019s why we feel confident in our full year guidance at mid single-digit growth and continued strong operating performance. ","Let me make a few comments around growth in general and give you a little bit of an update on the Remy acquisition and integration. First of all, from an integration perspective, it\u2019s going well and I think it\u2019s fair to characterize it that both financially and operationally, it\u2019s performing very much as we had expected. ","We remain very positive about the technology that came with the acquisition, and we have had many, many discussions with our customers, particularly around the combination products where we are going to leverage the rotatum electrical capability of Remy with our clutching capability. ","So that\u2019s very much on track and you will see that hardware for those of you lucky enough to be with us on September 7. In general, our quoting and our booking activity remains strong and very good about the win rates on our booking business and all of that leads to inline expectations are on track for growth. ","So let me kind of wrap up before I turn over to Ron. We had a good first half to the year and we feel very good about we delivered what we said we would. I think the business is operating well. ","We continue to be heavily focused on driving growth through the adoption of our technology, and we remain upbeat and positive about delivery and our full year guidance. So with that, let me turn the call over to Ron. ","Ron Hundzinski","Thank you, James and good day everyone. Before I review the financial details, I would like to bright you some of the highlights as I see them for the quarter. In summary, we saw solid growth, great operating performance and a return to normal CapEx spending and free cash flow generation. ","Now as Ken mentioned, I will be referring to supplemental financial slide deck that is posted on our website. So I do encourage you to follow along. But first, I\u2019d like to focus your attention on Slide 2, I am sorry, Slide 3. ","Throughout the presentation I will highlight certain non-US GAAP measures to provide a clear picture of how the core business performed and for comparisons with prior periods. Specifically, we will be excluding the impact of FX, Remy, and non-comparable items from certain US GAAP measures. ","So when you hear me say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of FX, Remy and non-comparable items. When you hear me say on a reported basis, that means US GAAP. Now with that our of the way, let's move forward.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 4. On a reported basis, which includes the change in sales due to market growth, price, net new business, FX, and Remy acquisition, sales were up 14.6%. On a comparable basis, our sales are up 3.5%, just above the midpoint of our guidance. ","On a reported basis, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 21.3% in the quarter, on a comparable basis, gross margin was 21.4% up 30 basis points from last year. On a reported basis, SG&A was 8.7% of sales. ","On a comparable basis, SG&A was 8.2% of sales or basically flat from the same period a year ago. R&D spending, which is included in SG&A was 3.6% of sales. However, this did include the impact of Remy. So on a comparable basis, R&D spending as a percentage of sales was flat year-over-year. ","Now let\u2019s look at the year-over-year comparison for operating income which can be found on Slide 5. Starting on the right, second quarter 2016 operating income excluding non-comparable items but including Remy it was $288 million or 12.4% of sales. If you also exclude Remy\u2019s $13 million net contribution, operating income on a comparable basis was $275 million or 13.2% of sales up 30 basis points from a year ago and yes, James, that is impressive.","On a comparable basis, operating income was up $16 million on $71 million of higher sales. That gives us incremental margin of 23% in the quarter, outstanding performance. As you look further down the income statement, equity and affiliate earnings was about $10 million in the quarter down slightly from a year ago. ","Interest expense and finance charges were $21 million in the quarter, up from $18 million a year ago, the increase is primarily due to the $500 million Euro fixed rate senior notes issued in the third quarter of 2015. ","Provision for income taxes in the quarter on a reported basis was $84 million. However, this included $2 million net tax benefit related to our non-comparable items and a favorable tax adjustment. You can read about each of these adjustments in our 10-Q which will be filed later today.","Excluding these items, the provision for income taxes was $86 million for an effective tax rate of 31%, which is inline with our full year guidance. Net earnings attributable to non-controlling interest was about $11 million, up $2 million from the second quarter of 2015, this line item reflects our minority partner share in the earnings performance of our Korean and Chinese consolidated joint ventures. ","Now let\u2019s take a look at our diluted earnings per share on Slide 6. Net earnings excluding non-comparable items, but including Remy were $0.84 per diluted share. On a comparable basis, net earnings were $0.80 per diluted share. Now let\u2019s take a closer look at the operating segments in the quarter beginning on Slide 7 of the deck. ","Reported Engine segment net sales were just over $1.4 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the Engine segment on a comparable basis was 2.8%, primarily due to Higher Attributable Charger and Variable Cam timing sales, partially offset by weak commercial vehicle markets around the world. ","Turning to Slide 8, reported adjusted EBIT was $235 million for the Engine segment or 16.3% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Engine segment adjusted EBIT was up $8 million on $39 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 20%, again solid performance for the Engine segment. ","Turning to Slide 9 and starting from the right. Drivetrain segment net sales were $895 million in the quarter. This included $240 million of sales from Remy. Sales growth for the Drivetrain segment on a comparable basis was 5.4%, primarily due to higher all-wheel drive sales. ","On Slide 10, reported adjusted EBIT was $93 million for the Drivetrain segment or 10.4% of sales. Excluding Remy, adjusted EBIT was 12.2% of sales, up 70 basis points from the prior year. ","On a comparable basis, the Drivetrain segment\u2019s adjusted EBIT was up $10 million on $34 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 29%, very good performance for the Drivetrain segment. ","Now, let\u2019s take a look at our balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $362 million of net cash from operating activities in the first half of the year, which is up $43 million from a year ago. Capital spending was $235 million in the first half, which is down $15 million from a year ago. Capital spending was above our trend in 2015, but we have returned to normal spending levels. As a percentage of sales, CapEx was 5.1% in the first half at the low end of our historical range of 5% to6% of sales.","Free cash flow which was defined \u2013 which we define as net cash from operating activity less capital spending was $127 million in the first half, up $93 million from a year ago. We are still on track to generate between $400 million and $475 million of free cash flow in 2016 and at the midpoint that\u2019s up 50% from 2016. ","Looking at the balance sheet itself, balance sheet debt increased by $85 million and cash decreased by $83 million. In the first half, compared with the end of 2015, we purchased \u2013 our debt increased $168 million, which is primarily due to share repurchases. We spent $100 million repurchasing 5.4 million shares in the first half, they have scheduled for executing expected $200 million to $300 million of share repurchases this year. ","Our net debt to net capital ratio was 36.3% at the end of the second quarter, up from 35.2% at the end of 2015. Net debt to EBITDA at the end of the year on a trailing 12 month basis was 1.5%. ","Now I'd like to discuss our current 2016 guidance, which has improved from our previous guide, as James mentioned. So returning to the deck, let's start with our sales growth guidance for the full year, on Slide 11. ","Note that the baseline 2015 net sales exclude Remy. We have raised the low end of our guidance range by 100 basis points, all in, we expect to grow between 13.7% and 17.5% this year, up from 12.7% to 17.5% previously. Helping the improved outlook is due to greater comfort with volume and launch-time assumptions in our net new business. ","The other half is because we expect the impact of currency to be less negative, compared with our previous guide. Market-related growth and new business growth net of pricing is now expected to be between 3% and 5.5%. ","Now, let's look at our operating income guidance on Slide 12 from an operating performance perspective. We are expecting 15% to 17% incremental margin on our core business sales growth, which is slightly down from our previous guide of 16% to 18%. This is nothing excited about just a few minor adjustments after taking a closer look at the remaining part of the year. ","On an incremental - incremental margins will be lower in the second half, then the 19% we delivered in the first half, primarily due to a tough comparison in the third quarter last year. In the third quarter 2015, we implemented sharp cost controls in response to the macro uncertainty we saw last year. ","That spending has returned to normal making the year-over-year third quarter comparison challenging. On a comparable basis, we still expect our operating income margin to be greater than 13%, and including Remy, our operating income margin is still to be expected to be greater than 12%. ","On Slide 13, we have our EPS guidance. We now expect earnings of $3.16 to $3.32 per share. This includes $0.12 per share contribution from Remy, up from the $3.11 to $3.32 previously. The primary driver of the change is a lower share count which raised EPS by about $0.04 across the range. ","Raising the low end of our sales guidance range added another penny per share to the low end and at the high end of the range, the lower incremental margin and other minor adjustments offset the lower share count. ","Now let's review our third-quarter guidance issued in this morning starting with the sales growth on Slide 14. All in, we expect to grow between 13% and 21% in the third quarter, excluding 13 percentage points due to Remy. Excluding Remy, our growth in the quarter is expected to be between 0.3% ad 7.6% but this includes a negative impact to currency. ","Currency is expected to lower sales by 220 basis points at the low end and 10 basis points at the high end. On a comparable basis, we expect to grow between 2.5% and 7.5% in the quarter. Our growth is improving in the second half, primarily due to major truck launches with GM and Ford. ","From an earnings perspective, as shown on Slide 15, we expect earnings of $0.74 to $0.81 per share in the third quarter which includes about $0.03 per share from Remy. Excluding Remy, we expect earnings to be $0.71 to $0.78 per share. ","So in conclusion, we had a very good second quarter. This is the third quarter in a row of exceeding our EPS and sales goals. And as we look forward at the rest of the year, we expect to continue on this path. Solid sales growth, strong operating margins, and improved cash flow from a year ago, I absolutely remain confident that we will deliver our 2016 guidance. ","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Ken.","Ken Lamb","Thanks, Ron. We are now going to move to the Q&A portion of the call. Chrissie, could you please remind everyone of the Q&A procedure?","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo Securities. ","Rich Kwas","Hi, good morning everyone.","James Verrier","Good morning, Rich.","Ron Hundzinski","Good morning, Rich.","Rich Kwas","So I just wanted to follow-up on, on the launches here. So Ford indicated some issues on their end, at least with Super Duty, you indicated that it launched on your end and so, is there \u2013 as you look at it right now, and what have you factored into potential incremental risk for the launches into the back half of the year? ","James Verrier","Yes, I think, Rich, what I would say is, let me try and take it this way with you. So as we started out the year, we \u2013 obviously, we had a lot of launches and what have you and the approach we took was sort of \u2013 build some judgment into the launch cadence, right, by the timing and volume and then, obviously, we have factored in some macros. ","So I am getting confidence, if you look at the first couple of quarters, where we\u2019ve gone through other launches around the world. Clearly, the second half is a little more weighted, as I sit here today, I feel, we\u2019ve done a pretty good job of factoring in the launch cadences as we see today. ","So, it\u2019s never perfect right, you don\u2019t know, but I think we\u2019ve continued that mantra of applying some judgment to the both - the timing and the volume ramp. And I think as we sit here today, we are as good as we can build in terms of forecasting it up.","Rich Kwas","Okay and then within Ford and VW, two of your most important customers, when you look at Ford within North America and then VW within Europe, what\u2019s changed since the beginning of the year in terms of outlook? Ford looks to be a little heavy on inventory in particular F-series has been. Have you factored any additional risk as it relates to some of the key programs for both those customers?","James Verrier","Yes, I think, again if I think of it in the first half, second half, Rich, as a good example, actually the first quarter we talked about VW run light in China, you remember that, but that is tough timing in China. But in the second quarter in China, we anticipated some challenges there and we still delivered. So again, it gives me some comfort and I think it\u2019s fair to say, we\u2019ve built in some judgment factor here about whether it\u2019s VW market share, whether it\u2019s volume ramps and I think at this stage we feel pretty well covered by it. ","Rich Kwas","Okay, and then, just a last quick one for me on the fuel efficiency standards. Those got initial proposal or updated proposal for mid-term review got released a couple of weeks ago. James, you indicated that the discussions are still very healthy around Powertrain and whatnot. Anything that the changes seem to be pretty modest, at least if they go through as detailed? So, what are your updated thoughts now that we have something on a piece of paper that we can debate?","James Verrier","Yes, I think you captured it really well, Rich actually, it\u2019s very modest changes. The only thing that\u2019s a little different us, it was \u2013 obviously the truck comp mix is a little different in North America, so that kind of moves things around in our company to look at their overall fleet averages. But fundamentally, I mean, the standards are not changing of any note, have you. I would say the pull for the types of technologies that we have to deliver on those standards is as strong as it was six months, twelve months or eighteen months ago. So we are not seeing any pullback at all in terms of these iron drives for the types of technologies that we have and I think our best guess is we engage with EPA and others is, there could be some nuancing and some modest minor tweaks to the standards. But we have not seen anything material enough that changed the direction of the OEMs and what we are doing with them. ","Rich Kwas","Okay. Thanks, I\u2019ll pass it on. I appreciate it.","James Verrier","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Leiker from Robert W. Baird & Company. Your line is open.","Adam Schmitz","Hi guys, this is Adam on the line for David.","Ron Hundzinski","Good morning, Adam.","James Verrier","Good morning.","Adam Schmitz","I appreciate we are still several quarters away from you guys giving a bookings number, but as we sit here halfway through the year, can you give a little more color on the pace of new bookings over the past several years and kind of how they have trended relative to 2015?","James Verrier","Yes, I think, you are right, we will do our net new business update as we go into January. So it\u2019s a few months away. If we reflect back on the current backlog of net new business, we \u2013 this year it was a mid single-digit type growth and as you can see so far we delivering against that. So that gives us comfort. It stepped up just a little into 2017 and 2018, but still in that mid single-digit range. And I think, we will give a lot more color as we get closer to it. But, I don\u2019t think there has been any material shifts to sway us away from sustained mid single-digit growth at least for the next couple of years. So that\u2019s typically how I think about it Adam.","Adam Schmitz","Great, great. And then on the strong incremental margins in the quarter kind of driving your margin gains, how sustainable are these moving forward, just given some of the restructuring actions you've taken and then some of the improvements and Wahler and Remy, et cetera? ","Ron Hundzinski","A good example Adam, just if you take a look at Drivetrain segment, which is nearly 30% incremental margins. There is a portion in there of the restructuring activities benefit that we are getting. So, when you go to a comparable basis, eventually year-over-year, that\u2019s going to moderate back to a normal mid teen type of incremental margins. I think we expect a little bit of that still in this year, but as we go into next year is when you start to see it moderate. I think the Engine segment at 20 was actually a better performance probably we anticipate it going in, just a great job. Our target still is mid-teens, but I think the majority of that really was the benefits of the restructuring cost year-over-year ","Adam Schmitz","Great, and then just lastly from me, you guys have one of the largest European businesses across the auto supply space. Just wondering what you are hearing from your customers, post-Brexit?","James Verrier","Yes, I think, you are right. First of all the second quarter was a good quarter for Europe in general pretty much across the board with most of the OEMs, it was a good solid quarter. ","But I would characterize year-to-date it\u2019s been actually stable and good in Europe. I would say from a post-Brexit perspective, we anticipate, I think like everybody else that the UK car production itself will have some impact as we go forward into 2017 and 2018. From a BorgWarner perspective our UK content is very small. ","How much of that then will flow into Europe in general, I think we need a little more time. I think everybody needs to kind of digest that. So we are watching it and I think it\u2019s a little early from a \u2013 how does it impact Europe in general. I would tell you we\u2019ve not seen any impact thus far in schedules and relationships and those types of things. ","So, I think it\u2019s going to be more of a 2017 type event and a 2016 event for Europe and the UK will trim itself up, but again that\u2019s \u2013 but that 1% of our revenue is in the UK. So, we feel pretty good where we are at right now. ","Adam Schmitz","Great. Thanks, guys.","Ron Hundzinski","Thank you.","James Verrier","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris McNally from Evercore. ","Chris McNally ","Hi, guys. Thanks so much. I wanted to go into a little detail on the Drivetrain margin, which is extremely strong for the quarter. You guys discussed that the incremental margin maybe in the second half will be a tougher compare, particularly in Q3. ","Could we just go into that in a little bit more detail some of the costs that you took out and where costs may be coming back and also can we start to think about the Drivetrain margin sequentially throughout the year? Is this sort of ex Q3 seasonality or it\u2019s a little bit down? Is this sort of a good level going forward?","Ron Hundzinski","So let\u2019s talk about the Drivetrain incremental margins for the second quarter first, okay. If you look at \u2013 I\u2019ll go back to Slide 10, you get this 29% incremental margin which is about $10 million, probably little bit less than half of that is because of the tailwinds that we are having for the full year from the restructuring activities, so it will cost $4 million for example. ","So, that\u2019s the benefit we are getting from the restructuring. If you take a look at the full year guidance, you can see $15 million roughly. I think we are $7 million year-to-date of restructuring tailwinds. So, we had about two I think it was in the first or something, sort of remaining in the second quarter. ","That\u2019s going to continue through the rest of the year. We will get that other 7, say rounding numbers here through the rest of the year and now the third quarter might be a little bit tougher, but the fourth quarter will get that through the year. I think we are on track in that range that we have for tailwinds. So that\u2019s Drivetrain, okay, which the best, we are on track. ","Now, the other issue that we are dealing with is the year-over-year, I mentioned in my script that we took some cost controls primarily in SG&A last year, when we saw some difficulties in the macro environment we are facing. ","So some of this SG&A spending is going to come back in the second half of the year, specifically, probably in the corporate spending rates will uptick about few million bucks here and there in the next two quarters. So that\u2019s what you are going to see going forward sequentially in the SG&A side, primarily in the corporate.","Chris McNally ","Okay. Perfect. Thanks so much.","Ron Hundzinski","Thank you, Chris.","James Verrier","Thank you, Chris.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. ","Brian Johnson ","Yes, good morning. ","James Verrier","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Johnson ","Just have some questions. One, kind of third quarter, more housekeeping-ish, and second more strategic. On the third quarter, fairly wide range of revenue estimate for the guide. Can you talk maybe a little bit more about the factors around that plus or minus that 5% swing that it could be? ","Ron Hundzinski","Yes, Rich, I mean, sorry Brian, and actually what I would say Brian, good observation, because it is a wide range and it\u2019s there intentionally for several factors. First, James mentioned, our launch cadence. There is a lot of still uncertainty on the launch cadence. We are comfortable with our guidance as far as the range, but they could swing fairly wildly because, some of it is new conquest business, it\u2019s not carryover business. ","So those have a significant impact on us. The second item is, we are going through the third quarter where you have customer shutdowns and although they say one thing, they may behave another way and it could be \u2013 that could be plus or minus. There is uncertainty on shutdowns. ","And then the third, I would like to point out, James talked about, just the general uncertainty, a good example is Ford this morning in their announcement and then James gave all the macro political issues going on. So when you factor in auto variability we kept the range wide quite frankly, because there is a lot of variability going on right now. ","Brian Johnson ","Okay and second question, and I know you\u2019ll discuss this more at the Investor Day on September 7. What did you say in terms of booking activity during the quarter around 48 volt and hybrid systems? And certainly, we noted Valeo a couple of days ago had some very strong momentum in that segment of its business in terms of the pipeline. What are you seeing around that?","James Verrier","Yes, Brian, we will show you, as you said, we will show you in a few weeks, a little bit more around that. But, we have a wide range of activities going on. Our quote activity is strong. And I would quote it in a lot of products both across pure EVs, hybrids in general and then 48 volt architectures. ","So we are \u2013 we continue to see strong activity. We are limited as to what we can say on specific business wins, Brian, just because of the customer approvals and communication, but it\u2019s a wide range of products ranging from belt alternator starter systems, E-booster technology, P2 hybrid clutching control modules. ","It\u2019s a wide range and the activity is very, very strong to be open and it\u2019s across a wide spectrum of products that is all leading to generating growth. Now what we will show you as we get to the Investor Day, Brian is, what\u2019s the ramp and the cadence of that growth, because obviously it\u2019s not this quarter or next quarter, these are programs that are going to kick in, in the next couple of three years. ","But we will take you through that basically, product-by-product and growth outlook that summarizes the specific question, quote activity is very strong and robust and we are winning pretty good share of what we want. But more to come in September Brian, is that\u2019s fair?","Brian Johnson ","And just to hit me, one quick follow-up, on Ron's comments about the third quarter. Ford indicated the need or we wouldn\u2019t necessarily argue there is a need to work down Ford inventory. So as you put together your guide, were you thinking in terms of what you would consider to be conservative Ford schedules as you thought about Q3 in second half? ","James Verrier","The way I would articulate it Brian is, the way we have been modeling for our business was, sequentially a step-down in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. ","So that\u2019s how we had modeled it. I think it\u2019s fair to say, through the first half of the year, we had modeled might be a little lighter than customer relations and schedules and as you see we\u2019ve done well in the first couple of quarters. So I think, we are pretty well aligned at this stage. ","Obviously, inventory adjustments and those things can be a little choppy and can create some noise, but I think, thus far we\u2019ve done a pretty nice job of anticipating and modeling in a pretty \u2013 in a balanced way, Brian, is the way I would characterize it.","Brian Johnson ","Okay. Thank you.","James Verrier","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. ","Samik Chatterjee ","Hi, this is Samik Chatterjee on for Ryan. The first question I had, a lot of discussion today on the call about the Ford Super Duty launch. So just wanted to get a context here from you I know, you have roughly indicated what sort of revenues from Ford, but, okay, are you able to share what ballpark for the Ford Super Duty is in terms of revenue for you guys?","James Verrier","Yes, I can give you a couple of thoughts here. So, if you look at what \u2013 our business and let\u2019s focus a little bit on North America, because I think that\u2019s really where the majority of the action is here. So, if you look at what our percentage is there, it\u2019s high single-digit of our total company. ","So, rough numbers, you can think of all of BorgWarner with Ford in North America maybe about an $800 million, $900 million revenue number for the year. So half of that\u2019s gone, right. So we are talking about a 400-ish number in the second half. I said that, earlier that, sequentially we are at a little lower, so you south the $400 million in the second half of the year. ","So let\u2019s just play that out and maybe that moves down a little bit based on some inventory true up, what are you, $20 million, $30 million, $40 million type of a number for our things. So it\u2019s important for us. We are not dismissing it, but it\u2019s also scaleable and manageable from a BorgWarner point of view. ","It\u2019s the way I would think of it. Specifically on the Super Duty, as Ron alluded to earlier, it\u2019s important to recognize that\u2019s conquest business for us. So, we go from zero to whatever. But our view is, at this stage is, we\u2019ve been following the schedules from Ford pretty well and we anticipate a good second of the year on Super Duty. ","Samik Chatterjee ","Got it. The second question, just pretty wide ranges for organic growth both in third quarter and probably implied for fourth quarter as well. I was wondering what are you really embedding in that guide for the commercial vehicle markets in the second half and what is the degree of risk you see in that market? ","James Verrier","Yes, now that\u2019s good thought. We\u2019ve \u2013 I think, we\u2019ve factored in overall a very low growth environment at all for commercial vehicle. We\u2019ve built in a pretty low Class-8 build for the North America and so that\u2019s a pretty strained area. ","I would say, a low to no growth environment in China and continued weakness around all highway pretty much globally and then a little bit of a growth in Europe over the road. And then Brazil remaining very challenged. ","So that\u2019s kind of what we are saying and I would say for us, what we\u2019ve seen in the first half of the year is, commercial vehicle is coming pretty much where we had anticipated for both Q1 and Q2. So I don\u2019t, and those have been some choppy orders. So I wouldn\u2019t expect this to be far off as we look into Q3 and Q4. ","Samik Chatterjee ","Just a final housekeeping one. I got to be trying both on incremental margin in the Engine segment year-over-year, just going sequentially and looking from 1Q to 2Q, the margins did sort of decline slightly, even on higher revenue. So, I was just wondering what that probably was attributable to?","James Verrier","Yes, that was what we just discussed this previously. SG&A costs will sequentially probably tick up. So that will probably bit more incremental margins more into \u2013 what I would call the normal range for us, which is mid-teens. So that\u2019s what\u2019s driving that is the SG&A spend sequentially.","Samik Chatterjee ","Okay, thanks. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Pat Archambault from Goldman Sachs.","Dave Tamberrino ","Hi, good morning. Hi, it\u2019s actually Dave Tamberrino on for Pat. A couple quick questions from us. One, as we are unpacking the revenue growth of the two segments, looking at Engine being up 2.8% versus Drivetrain up 5.4%. ","Traditionally, you'd think about the Engine business with the turbochargers being really the growth engine here. Wondering what\u2019s kind of creating this dynamic where Drivetrain is growing faster than Engine? Is it just the commercial vehicle weakness that you spoke to earlier, Ron, in Engine, and the all-wheel drive growth that you are seeing in Drivetrain that\u2019s driving it or is there something else there?","James Verrier","Yes, this is James, let me take a shot at that for you. I think, obviously, you will see quarters bounce around a little bit. Sometimes we are a little up in \u2013 higher in Drivetrains, sometimes it\u2019s Engine, it moves around a little bit. But in terms of why Engine was a little lower than some of our historical quarters, you are right, commercial vehicle was clearly a factor that only applies for our Engines segment. ","There is no commercial vehicle revenue in Drivetrain. So that was a key weight for us. I would say the other area that weight a little bit on us is China where some of our larger customers in China, so I am talking about Volkswagen, I am talking about Great Wall, I am talking about Ford and GM. I had pretty low growth quarters if you aggregate those four, actually it was no growth. ","So, that weighed more on Engine than Drivetrain as well. And those are two of the biggest things. It doesn\u2019t really concern us, as I say, because we do have bounces from quarter-to-quarter. So, I think it\u2019s explainable and it\u2019s kind of frankly speaking what we had anticipated in our guide. ","Dave Tamberrino ","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then just lastly, if we are thinking about the European production guide that\u2019s kind of under or production cadence that's underlying your guidance. ","There \u2013 it didn\u2019t sound like there is any softness as you are seeing or hearing, and there is not much as you\u2019ve really predicated into 2016 of any contagion from slower European sales growth as a result of the UK referendum. Is that the correct way to think about it?","James Verrier","Yes, that\u2019s actually a good summary. As Ron alluded to, there is always a little noise around shutdowns. That obviously plays its part, but we feel we\u2019ve got that pretty balanced and as I said earlier, I think the UK referendum impact will play itself out over the coming months and probably even into next year. So, yes, I think, you captured that pretty well. ","Dave Tamberrino ","Thank you very much. I appreciate all the detail.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton from KeyBanc. Your line is open. ","Brett Hoselton ","Good morning, gentlemen.","Ron Hundzinski","Good morning, Brett.","James Verrier","Good morning, Brett.","Brett Hoselton ","I wanted to ask you a longer-term strategic question and I know you\u2019ve talked about this some, but there is, I have got a number of questions from clients with regards to Remy and I was hoping you could provide us with some specific examples of how Remy helps you get into the electrification of the powertrain specifically? ","Secondly, do you anticipate it resulting in maybe, some sort of a hockey stick improvement in your revenue growth rate or does it just kind of allow you to continue to grow in the current range? ","And then finally, if you do actually see some sort of an uptick in your growth rate, what\u2019s kind of the timing on that? If I remember correctly, it\u2019s kind of a few years out, but go ahead.","James Verrier","Okay, Brett. That\u2019s happy to talk about that. So, let me talk a little bit about sources of growth for Remy. I think that was kind of your key question. I would encourage you and the investors to think of two channels of growth, first for Remy. ","First, channel of growth is primarily through their existing off-the-shelf technology for vehicles and applications that are in service today. What I mean by that is selling more belt alternator starters, starters and motors and generators to than they shell today. ","And what I mean by channels is on light vehicle, today they ship to Hyundai and General Motors and that\u2019s it and we see you leveraging the BorgWarner channels and the BorgWarner Relationships. ","But there is no reason on the planet why we come installing starters and alternators and belt alternator starter systems through other customers beyond their current. And regionally, they have almost no presence in Europe and clearly Borg has a big presence, so that\u2019s a regional play where we can accelerate our European relationships to grow what I would describe, Brett, as their core existing product line business. ","So that\u2019s a source of growth for us that we will leverage. And you would anticipate that can be done in a shorter horizon only because this quoting activity today and we have product to put on those vehicles. So that\u2019s the first source of growth. The second source of growth is where you are alluding to is to help take us further into electrification and there is a number of potential opportunities there. ","First of all, they have the motor technology that you could use either in a hybrid vehicle or a pure electric vehicle and that\u2019s the traction motor of sorts that we can use. The second path for them is to combine the rotating electrics of the motor coupled together with our clutching technology to offer hybrid vehicle solutions, where we need to bring together the motor and the clutching technology. ","So we can offer engagement or disengagement between the motor and the combustion engine. We have product on the shelf to do that today and we are quoting that activity. The third leg of opportunistic growth is the more advanced starter \u2013 belt alternator starter systems that will emerge as a lead for stop-start technology and hybrid technology and Remy has a number of products in that space that we will be pushing forward on to hybrid applications. ","The last area I would say just in general they bring motor technology that helps us on other product applications, so if you think of \u2013 I talked about earlier about an e-booster technology, which is the turbo charger with a boosting device compressor device, it requires power electronics and motor know how, Remy can bring that knowledge to us. ","All of that said, Brett, so where does that all translates to into dollars of growth? We are working our way through that. But there is certainly absolutely no reason why Remy wouldn\u2019t grow at least at BorgWarner levels. You got to give us a little bit of time to lay that out for you in terms of cadence and pull all of that together and we\u2019ll get through that over the next few months. ","So what we are going to do, Brett is, we\u2019ll use this September day to showcase the technology for you and some of the \u2013 and what we are dong on it and then we\u2019ll pull all of that together in the January net new business to lay out for you what the next three years of growth looks like from \u2013 for Remy both from conventional products and the combination products with BorgWarner products. Hopefully, that helps you a little bit.","Brett Hoselton ","That was very thorough, James. That\u2019s perfect. Thank you very much. Have a great day, guys.","James Verrier","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Stover from SIG. ","Matt Stover ","Thank you very much. A question just to clarify again on the Drivetrain margins. When you spoke to the second half compare, Ron, you referenced incremental margins. So, we should expect that your incremental profitability should improve in the second half? You did have quite a heavy third quarter period there last year or am I misunderstanding it?","Ron Hundzinski","All right, there is two topics here. One is, the Drivetrain segment will continue to get tailwinds from the restructuring activities that we did. If you look at the full year guidance from tailwinds, the majority of that tailwind is Drivetrain related. ","And we haven\u2019t seen all those benefits yet go through Drivetrain. So we will continue in the Drivetrain segment on the tailwinds. Now when you step back and it\u2019s the total company, what\u2019s often it offset that a little bit is probably SG&A spending that\u2019s coming into the business. ","So you have two dynamics going on. One is Drivetrain benefits tailwind, somewhat offset by SG&A spending coming back on a comparable basis. ","Matt Stover ","Okay. And then the second question is on just the equity and affiliates. I would assume, although this may be incorrect, that the Japanese profitability was up year-to-year in the second quarter, how should we then think about the profit contribution from the other geographies?","Ron Hundzinski","That line item doesn\u2019t really move that much. It fluctuates, what $1 million to $2 million historically, although it\u2019s been trending up over time. I wouldn\u2019t put a lot of focus on that line item. ","It\u2019s been a little bit ball \u2013 there is other things that come into play, FX comes into play and the production of those areas. But I would say that in general, if you are going to have a bias I guess, from that line item I would bias it maybe to the positive side at the end of the day.","Matt Stover ","I am just - I am trying to figure out the regional variables in this. I would assume that with the strength in the yen year-to-year, the NSK-Warner profit contribution would have improved. And I am just trying to think through what happened with Korea and the other equity affiliates? ","Ron Hundzinski","Right, that\u2019s I was referring to the FX impact. So, you can see favorable impacts from Japan, but the one is softer a little bit. So they get somewhat upset. So there is a lot of variability up and down in that item and it doesn\u2019t really move that much. ","The underlying production for us has been fairly positive. But it gets more offset by the FX variability quite frankly is what happens. So as you are trying to model it, what I would do is I would just try to model it where it\u2019s been and it\u2019s biased maybe to the positive side.","Matt Stover ","Thank you.","Ron Hundzinski","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John Murphy ","Good morning, guys. And I apologize, I got on the call late. So, if any of these are duplicative, please let me know and I can follow-up. Just first, as we look at the Super Duty launch in the second half of this year, I was wondering if you could indicate how much your content is going up on this new truck? And if you could give us a relative indexing or maybe even absolute of Super Duty content versus the F-150 for you on Drivetrain?","James Verrier","Yes, John, so, Super Duty first thing, that\u2019s kind of good to know is it\u2019s \u2013 so this is conquest for us. We got \u2013 so it\u2019s zero. So you should probably think in the $400 to $500 range of content for us on that vehicle. It\u2019s probably a good reference point, John.","John Murphy ","Okay, and relative to the F-150?","James Verrier","Depends \u2013 it\u2019s less than the F-150. If you think of the F-150 with all of our stuff on, transfer case, turbocharger, some variable cam timing product, you are kind of getting up kind of 2x versus the Super Duty. But it does depend a little bit obviously not all F-150s take a transfer case. So \u2013 but directionally, it\u2019s - F-150 is meaningfully higher than on content for us versus the Super Duty. ","John Murphy ","Okay. Thank you. And then a second question and just very simplistically, on Remy and you may have talked about this, I mean, the margin progressioning and cost performance, I mean, where is that relative to your expectation? And was that a significant driver to, maybe some of the upside we saw in margins in the quarter? ","Ron Hundzinski","Yes, obviously, the Remy performance second versus first quarter has improved almost about 100 basis points, which is quite frankly, was what we expected given the synergies that we talked about when we did the acquisition. So, long story short, I would say, John, we are pretty much on track on executing those synergies right now. ","John Murphy ","Okay. And then just lastly, I mean, some of the tone of the sort of the macro environment or industry environment from the automakers seems to be changing a little bit, a little bit less positive, not necessarily negative yet, but a lot less positive. ","Are you seeing any change in your relationship on bidding or pricing with the OEMs at this point? Or is there is just really no change in the environment relative to some of the macro pressures that might be seeping into the industry?","Ron Hundzinski","I would say, John, really no meaningful change. I mean, not to the labor, products and environment is always competitive, it\u2019s tough. But we are not seeing any movement there. ","I think I alluded earlier, John, maybe in terms of quoting activity, we are not seeing that tail-off or anything like that. R&D reviews, technology programs, advanced engineering programs, all pretty much continuing on as is so to speak. So, yes, we are not seeing any meaningful shift to your question.","John Murphy ","Great. Thank you very much guys.","James Verrier","Thanks. ","Operator","We have time for one final question and that question comes from Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets.","Jacob Hughes ","Hi, this is Jacob Hughes on for Joe. I just had one final question. I was wondering if you could just comment on the M&A pipeline and as well as what you are assuming in your guidance for the buyback for the rest of the year?","James Verrier","I\u2019ll take M&A pipeline first if you wish and then Ron can make some comments relative to the stock buyback program. So, M&A we\u2019ve talked about in recent calls, our primary focus obviously is to do successful integration of Remy. That\u2019s our priority one. You heard from Ron and both \u2013 Ron and myself that that\u2019s playing out well and as expected. ","So, that\u2019s kind of moving along well. We remain active and very interested in additional M&A activities. I\u2019ve alluded in earlier calls that our primary focus is around electronic software, power electronics type place and we have a number of things moving forward in that space and then other areas of interest as we\u2019ve talked in prior calls around valvetrain and we\u2019ve also talked about boosting our thermal management capabilities. ","So, yes, we remain active and if a deal is there for us, we would move forward. But again, priority one is successful integration of Remy. Relative to buybacks, Ron can give a clear format.","Ron Hundzinski","Yes, buybacks, real quick. Our guidance for the year was $200 million to $300 million. If you took a look at our year-to-date, which is about $180 million. Obviously, I would say that we are into the high end of our guidance range right now where we are trending and short.","Jacob Hughes ","Yes, thank you.","James Verrier","Thank you.","Ken Lamb","All right, Jacob.","Ken Lamb","So, I would like to thank you all again for joining us. We expect to file our 10-Q before the end of the day, which will provide details of our results.

You'll find the link below the notice for this call. We encourage you to follow on during our discussion.","With that, I'll turn it over to James.","James Verrier","Thank you, Pat, and good day to everybody, and we appreciate you joining us this morning for our call. Ron and I are very pleased to share our results from Q3 2017, and also update you on our progress towards delivering 2017 targets.","I'd like to start actually by sharing a few thoughts on the macro environment and the industry. And for those of you following along on, that would be on slide number six. We do recognize there is still instability in many aspects from a macro perspective as we look around the world, but I would say, in general, production volumes were only modestly weaker than our expectations as we went into quarter. And let me break that down a little bit for you. So, from a global light vehicle production was up about 2% in Q3, when you look at that prior adjusted geographic exposure, production was flat.","European light vehicle production increased about 4.5% which was slightly better than our expectations going to the quarter, China light vehicle production was also up about -- was up about 1% and that was roughly in line with our expectations as we went into the quarter. North American light vehicle production declined by about 10%, which was a little more than our expectations as we went into the quarter.","If I talk a little bit about the market outlook, let me talk about light vehicle 2017 calendar year first and we are pretty closely aligned with IHS which is calling for about a 1% growth in China, Europe up a little over 3%, North America production down about 3.5%.","And this implies global production growth of less than 1% when you adjust for geographic exposure. Market outlook relative to commercial vehicle, the outlook for Europe and China continues to improve and we also see orders in North America have improved since our last outlook update and I would say we're cautiously optimistic that this strength will continue.","If I was to characterize what we're keeping an eye on and watching as we play out the rest of the year, I would point to three things really, the first one is the material cycle here in North America and North American schedules have continued to weaken albeit modestly and so far production adjustments have been pretty much in line with our expectations but clearly will continue to watch that closely.","The diesel gas mix in Europe obviously we continue to pay a lot of attention to that, I would say diesel share declined by approximately 530 basis points year-over-year in Q3 and we do continue to expect diesel gas mix to shift through the end of the decade, the good news for us at BorgWarner is we continue to offset that.","China we will also pay close attention to and we're still expecting modest industry growth in 2017, more importantly for us at BorgWarner add growth over the market remains very strong due to the content for vehicle increases, so what they said we remain very confident in our strong outgrowth of the market in 2017 based on the continued strong demand for our products.","Let me share a few highlights around technology and I think I start with the first key point which is the strong drive to fuel economy emissions regulations and the pull for advanced propulsion technology continues.","Activity in hybrids and EVs continue to accelerate no slow down at all, if I break that down a little further, let me talk about what we see in hybrids, I would say the interesting 48-volt hybrid continues to gather speed and gain momentum and grow, I would say the most activity we're seeing is predominantly Europe but we are seeing increasing interest and pick up in both North America and in China.","From an electric vehicle perspective, we see the Chinese OEMs continuing to move at a rapid pace, I would say to work with the Europeans continues to increase and we've seen increased activity around Beijing, North America also.","So continued efforts there, but let me share a key takeaway that I've seen over the last few months as I've engaged with more and more customers. I think the key is all of our major customers that are exploring a wide variety of options, we see there's no one solution and for each of the customers it depends on their vehicle fleet mix, regional balance and some of the specific propulsion strategies of the OEMs. What we clearly see though is they all have a balance of combustion hybrid and electric propulsion in that portfolios and we continue to work with them every day of the week frankly on two things, one is helping them to define the optimum mix of combustion hybrid and electric and also discussions around the specific propulsion technologies that they require to get where they need to.","Let me move to Slide 7 and as Pat alluded to, I wanted to share a few highlights of growth for us in the quarter and I'm going to talk about four key announcements here that you saw, the transfer case win for us on the new Range Rover Velar program, their SUV was a great win for us and a sign of our continued growth in the all-wheel drive business for us.","Our two-stage Turbo for Honda's new three cylinder one liter engine gasoline directed was another significant win for us because this is a great story of growth for us with Japanese OEMs. Our cabin heating technology for a new electric vehicle is another significant we did push for electric vehicle growth and this is with globally known EV automaker. The fourth one there you see is our electric motor technology at Scania on the new city wide hybrid bus for urban areas again points to another good win in commercial vehicle and electric vehicle technology.","So the key takeaway there is you look at the four is a really great mix of business growth and this is another evidence for me in yet another quarter that confirms our strategy of a balanced approach continues to work and we see win rates across all propulsion systems for combustion hybrid and electric products.","Now let me move to Slide 8 and thought give you a little bit of a financial recap and obviously Ron will take you through a lot more detail when he goes and speaks in a few minutes. So I'll start with the Q3 outlook and results for BorgWarner and let me start maybe with the obvious, I'm very pleased with our Q3. Our growth exceeded the high end of our guidance and our operating performance was in line with expectations. Sales of $2.4 billion is up 10.8% organically when we exclude FX and Remy. And this compares to our light vehicle end market exposure which was basically flat in the quarter.","Regionally, it was pretty much as we had expected, strong growth in China particularly with DCT and North America with new business and mix, our Europe light vehicle revenue was up mid single digit despite the gas diesel mix shift and this light vehicle growth was supplemented by positive revenue trends in commercial vehicle both on and off road.","EPS of $0.95 excluded non-comparable items is a really good result for us and again Ron will share more of that with there and our operating, adjusted operating margin of 12.3% was solid, solid performance.","If I break that down a little further by segment, really the key for me was I was very excited to see strong growth across all of our products, so engine sales of $1.5 billion that's 8.7% growth organically which is strong, some of that strong growth came from Turbo and timing systems and our thermal products and again despite the change to the diesel gas mix we're seeing solid top line growth in the engine segment.","Drivetrain $920 million in the quarter, that's up 14.4% organically, strong all-wheel drive, DCT and transmission components sales in North America, China and Europe. Let me spend a moment and give you a high level view of the 2017 outlook and I'm really pleased to talk about a rise again in guidance. We're increasing our revenue and earnings forecast for 2017, we expect organic growth of 9.0% to 9.5% year-over-year and this compares to our prior guidance of 6.5% to 7.5%. And this again compares to a market that is growing less than 1%.","Our consolidated operating income margin is expected to expand 20 to 30 basis points and our EPS guidance range is now 381 to 383 per diluted share which is up from the 365; 370 previously.","Let me now move to Slide number 9 and as Pat alluded to I wanted to share a little bit of commentary on the Sevcon acquisition that we completed in the end of the quarter, first of all we're really excited to add this business to the BorgWarner portfolio, we really believe that Sevcon complements BorgWarner's existing power electronic capabilities and affected doubles our number of dedicated power electronics engineers in the company.","Now near term this business will have a revenue run rate of about $60 million at year end and it will be modestly dilutive to 2018 results but the real story is what Sevcon is going to add to our top line over the long term by integrating their technology with our current product portfolio.","So before I turn it over to Ron, I just wanted to share a few of my comments relative to the restructuring of our emissions business. I know we've discussed in the past few quarters this business continues to not meet the expectations of BorgWarner. So this quarter, we announced a $12.6 million restructuring charge for this business, we do expect additional restructuring over the next several quarters and as we formulate our plan, there are two items that we are addressing, most significantly there are product lines within our emissions business that we have determined are non-core.","We plan to rationalize the footprint related to these products and will also explore our strategic options for these product lines as well. The second part of the plan now is we will also take steps to improve the overall competitiveness of our remaining European Emissions business and again Ron will provide a little more color on that shortly.","So let me bring all that together and summarize for us, Q3 was an excellent quarter, we exceeded our expectations for top line growth and operating performance was in line with our expectation.","And given our strong year-to-date performance we're increasing our revenue guidance for the year despite a modestly weakened industry production outlook So in summary for me I believe the company's position to deliver a mid to high single digit growth over the long term by continuing to execute our strategy of propulsion system leadership across combustion hybrid and electric vehicles.","So with that, let me turn the call over now to Ron. ","Ron Hundzinski","Thank you, James and good morning everyone. Before I review the financial details I would like to provide you some of the highlights as I see them for the quarter. First it was another strong quarter. Second average performance was as we expected and finally given a strong performance year to date we are confident raising our full year guidance again.","Now is Pat mentioned I will be referring to supplemental, financial slide doc as posted on our IR website. I encourage you to follow along. Let's turn to Slide 11 on a reported basis sales were up 9.1%. On a comparable basis our organic sales were up 10.8%.","Very strong performance compared to our weighted average light vehicle industry production for the quarter as James mentioned which was flat. We saw 34% growth in China against the production market that was up 1%. In Europe revenue was up 7% so I think better than the 4.5% production growth in the quarter.","North America revenue was up low double digit versus the 10% production decline in the quarter. Commercial Vehicle was a benefit again contributing more than 200 basis points. Diesel and gas in Western Europe was ahead when but lower than we expected going into the quarter. Before I moved to the operating profit I would like to discuss our gross profit and SG&A line.","Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 21.6% in the quarter up 30 basis points over last year. SG&A was 9.3% of sales R&D spending which is included SG&A was 4.2% of sales. SG&A was down 20 basis points from a year ago driven by leveraging higher sales. Now look at the year-over-year comparison for offering income which can be found on Slide 12.","Q3 adjusted operating profit was $298 million or 12.3% of sales compared to $265 million in Q3 of '16 which was 12% resulting in a 30 basis improvement. Our organic basis operating income was up $32 million and $232 million of higher sales that gives us an incremental margin of 14% in the quarter and in line with our expectation.","And was an improvement from the incremental margins we saw less than 10% for the first half of the year as you look further down the income statement equity in the affiliate earnings was about $14 million in the quarter up $2 million from last year. Interest expense and finance charges were $18 million in the quarter down over $4 million from last year due to lower debt levels.","Excluding a $5 million favorable tax adjustment the provision from income taxes was $86 million for an effective tax rate of 29% for the quarter. Net earnings attributable to nine controlling interest was about $10 million flat from the third quarter last year. This line represents our minority partner shared earnings performance in our Korean and Chinese consolidated joint ventures.","Earnings per share on a reported basis for $0.88 per diluted share on a comparable basis net earnings were $0.95 per diluted share. Now let's take a closer look at our offering segments in the quarter beginning in slide 13 of the deck. Reported engine segment net sales were $1.506 billion in the quarter.","Sales growth for engine segment on a comparable basis was 8.7% as demand for a light vehicle OEM products was supplemented again by growth in the commercial vehicle business. Adjusted EBIT was $239 million for the engine segment or 15.8% of sales. On a comparable basis the engine segments adjusted EBIT was up $16 million on a $118 million of sales for an incremental margin of 14%.","Within the segment strong performance and our terrible and timing systems was partially offset by continuing operating headroom's in the emissions business as James mentioned earlier. We announced initial restructuring charge of our emissions business $12.6 million in the quarter. We expect additional restructuring over the next several quarters as we formulate our plan to improve this business for going the levels of returns.","The total cost of this restructuring could vary widely depending on the strategy we optimally pursue, respect to give you an estimate of these costs in the coming quarters. Now turning the slide 14 and starting on the right hand side. Drivetrain segment net sales were $922 million in the quarter. This includes the reduction of $68 million of sales from the divestiture of the remaining light vehicle aftermarket.","Sales growth for Drivetrain segment on a comparable basis was 14.4% primarily due to higher all wheel Drivetrain transmission components and strong to a clutch transmission growth in China. Adjusted EBIT was $112 million for the Drivetrain segment or 12.1% of sales on a comparable basis the Drivetrain segment adjusted EBIT was up $22 million and $115 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 19% this is a very strong performance and reflects the successful ramp of new programs.","Now let's take a close look at our balance sheet and cash flow. We generate $624 million of net cash from offering activities in the first three quarters of the year messed up $31 million over last year. Capital spending was $300 million year-to-date up $35 million from a year ago. Pre- cash flow which we defined as net cash from operating activities less net capital spending was $234 million which is basically flat from 2016.","Looking at the balance sheet itself balance sheet debt was up and cash decreased by $29 million compared with the end of 2016 to $205 million increase in net debt was primarily due the purchase of economy. Our net capital ratio was 33.6% at the end of Q3 which is down slightly from 35% at the end of 2016 and the net debt to EBITDA at the end of the quarter was 1.22 times.","Now I like to discuss our 2017 guidance which we have increased so let's start with our sales growth guidance for the full year on slide 16. Backlog pricing and market related growth are expected to drive 9% to 9.5% organic sales growth. Note this excludes the Sevcon acquisition which is expected to add $15 million of sales in Q4. ","Currency is expected to be a small tailwind now. From a performance perspective let's turn to slide 17 again. We expect low teens incremental margins on our sales growth. Included in this our headwinds from corporate costs reflect in year to date headwinds as well as the Q4 approvals based on a stronger top line and earnings.","Our consolidated operating income margin is suspected to expand by 20 to 30 basis points. To finish our full year guidance please turn the slide 18, EPS guidance ranges now $3.81 to $3.83 for diluted share versus our $3.65 to $3.70 previously.","The increase is driven by our sales guidance and increase in a lower impact of foreign currency for the full year. Free cash flow which define its net cash provided by at varying activities the CapEx is expected to be $450 million to $500 million now.","Capital spending included tooling is expected to be in the range of $525 million to $575 million which is up modestly to support several program uplifts. R&D spending as a percentage of sales is expected to be about 4% in 2017. The tax rate is expected to remain at 29% as well. Our assumption for the dollar to euro exchange rate has been adjusted so 1.25 to 1.10 as a reminder everyone sent change in the dollar to euro exchange rate equals about $30 mllion to $35 million sales.","Our fourth quarter guidance let's turn to slide 20. First sales note that remain after market divested are about $20 million and we have added about $15 million of Sevcon sales so starting at a base of $2.239 billion. Net new business pricing in market related growth are expected to drive organic sales growth of about 5% to 6.5%. In addition currencies now expected to increase sales growth by about $85 million.","Therefore, 2017 Q4 sales is expected to be $2.47 billion at the mid-point. On Slide 21 is our EPS walk for the Q4, as I have already walked to our full year walk, I will not go through all the details, so for Q4 we expect earnings of $0.99 to a $1.01 per share, this includes about a $1 I'm sorry about a $0.01 unfavorable impact from Sevcon.","So let me summarize Q3, it was a strong third quarter, organic sales growth was more than 10% despite flattish industry volume, incremental margins improved sequentially as we were expecting, as we look forward to 2017 and beyond, we continue to drive intensity around our new product development and support it with acquisitions to participate in impending electrification trend.","So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat.","Patrick Nolan","Sharon, we're ready to open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Colin Langan with UBS.","Colin Langan","Thanks for taking my question. I actually wanted to follow-up on Slide 7, you highlighted sort of two things that were interesting, the cabin heater opportunity; any quantification of who are the main categories there? I haven't heard too many people talk about trying to target that market, and what kind of content opportunities there? And also the turbocharger opportunity with Honda, I mean, are you seeing -- it feels like there has been more headlines from the Japanese OEMs, are we seeing that opportunities start to increase there with Japanese moving feel little bit more engines outside there?","James Verrier","Yes, good morning, Colin. Yes this is James. So let me start on the Turbo one first if that's okay, we had seen increased adoption rates with the Japanese OEMs on Turbo, that's probably evolved over the last I would say five years, four or five years and we see that trend continuing and we see that trend continuing on both combustion powered vehicles and also on hybrid vehicles where they're utilizing turbo in both of those configurations.","So we have seen that, we've been particularly pleased with win with Honda, we've developed a really strong partnership there and launching some of our latest two stage technology on that one liter engine on the gas engine has been that's been a big success for us. So yes we're seeing more and more usage of Turbo with the Japanese OEMs. The cabin heating opportunity we're really pleased about that, that that was the technology that came to us through the BERU acquisition a few years ago and this is our first significant win with the U.S. And if you think of competitors in that space I would say [indiscernible] is probably the most well-known that you would probably know in the cabin heating space, we also see what Astro played in that space as well, so those are two of the most well known ones that I would point to Colin but we're pleased with how that's progressing for us, we would like the technology and as we've alluded to it's a good growth platform for us on peer EVs.","Colin Langan","Okay. And just any color on emissions restructuring, I mean when do you get the benefits from the actions that you're taking? And any sense that you said you're considering trade you might actually sort of divesting some of the products in there, is that right?","James Verrier","Yes Colin, let me kind of give a little bit of a high level answer to that and then Ron could supplement it with any any specific details. Again I think this again there is two dimensions so to speak to what we're doing here, the one is we have identified a couple of non-core product lines and we're evaluating all of the strategic options associated with those. So that's the one aspect and then the other aspect is a more generic footprint optimization as well, we're still in the process of working through those details Colin as Ron had said to you.","It could one option could be divestiture, one option could be restructure the sort of different options here and as Ron and I thought about this until we got a little bit more clarity around that we need a little more time to be candid, but it does include all options are on the table frankly. And we're going to work our way through that through the fourth quarter and I think we will have more color for you when we come back on to the earnings call in February of next year.","Colin Langan","Great, thank you very much.","James Verrier","Thanks Colin.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.","Ryan Brinkman","Thanks for taking my questions, just a follow up on that, have you discussed which sort of sub-segments of emissions is considered non-core and how that differs from the portion of emissions business that is still core, does it relate in any way to for example dollars?","Ron Hundzinski","Yes I can add a little bit of clarity there Ron, so the two product lines that we were viewing as non-core tool from a BorgWarner perspective, think of thermostats and think of pipes, it has nothing at all to do with core EGR business, EGR bowls, EGR modules, EGR coolers, those are fantastic businesses that are doing really, really well for us. So it's in that the thermostats and pipes. When we look at the level of technology differentiation that BorgWarner excels in I don't think they bring that kind of technology differentiation, they don't bring the growth profile so much as a BorgWarner product line. So those are the two product lines that we're referring to.","Ryan Brinkman","Okay, that's really helpful and just lastly from me then on the expected sequential deceleration in year-over-year growth as you go from 3Q to 4Q, you did 10% in 3Q looking for 5 to 6.5 in 4Q, very simplistically I look at like North America production that was kind of a drag in 4Q down 10%, IHS was something more like minus 3% in 4Q. So, just curious what drove incremental headwinds are that you seem to be something specific with your backlog or something and if not maybe you think that potential of risk skewed to the upside organic growth in 4Q?","Ron Hundzinski","Sure Ryan. This is Ron. I'll give you three of the high level, first of all is diesel mix in Europe like we mentioned on the call, we're not seeing the headwind that we anticipated in Q3, so that gets pushed into our Q4 where the sale starts to show through the production levels, we assume that could be as much as 300 basis point headwind for us in that fourth quarter, that's one item.","Korea has been an issue for us as well, that can swing to a negative in Q4 again over last year and then if you remember last year, we had some really good launches in the fourth quarter, the Duramax for example and F250 and we're going to lap those, so we're going to see not have that as a tailwind as well going into the fourth quarter, so three of them at high level.","Ryan Brinkman","Okay, very helpful. Thanks a lot, congrats on the quarter.","Ron Hundzinski","Thanks Ryan.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache","Good morning everybody. First just wanted to ask about backlog it was that shows $268 million in the quarter, your guidance was 100 to 150 and it seems like every quarter it's coming in a bit higher than your guidance, so I'm wondering whether there's any reason why we shouldn't be thinking about upside to the number for next year, the 460 to 670, you did kind of enhance that, there's been some program uplifts and that's affecting CapEx, so it seem to suggest that?","James Verrier","Hi Rod, this is James. So couple of thoughts from my end at least you're right, we've been tracking ahead of what we've come into the year expected and that's a good feeling obviously and that's that is predominantly backlog related.","To your point about next year, I would reiterate my comfort and confidence in the 7% CAGR number that we put out there but obviously over the next few weeks, we're going to -- we're going to take a good look at that and then as we come into January into Detroit we would obviously give you more specificity around 2018 backlog and obviously the three year period as well. But I would think of it this way rather the way this year's transition for us just gives me at least builds a lot more confidence and comfort of the numbers as we go into next year.","Rod Lache","Okay, great. And just secondly, I was wondering if you thought there were any competitive implications from the strategic changes that that were announced by your biggest competitor in Turbos, we've seen that actually happen in other segments where multi industry companies have announced divestitures, so any kind of high level thoughts on what have they been running the business today, how that's affected you and how that maybe run into future?","James Verrier","Yes I would say from my point Rod that Honeywell has always been an excellent competitor, very strong, strong player and I don't see that really necessarily changing, we will see how it plays out, the most important part for me though that I would want to reiterate is we just continue to see two things strong penetration growth at turbos internal so we still see the turbo business as a strong growth engine for BorgWarner and we still see our one-third market share position that we have very solid, very solid as we look this year and we look at a three year and a five year view. So, for us, it's kind of no change is the way I look at it right we feel great about the turbo business. We love the growth and we love our strong competitive position and I think he will do what they need to do.","Rod Lache","Okay, great. Thank you.","James Verrier","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America.","John Murphy","Good morning guys. May be just a follow up on sort of the backlog question Rod just asked me, you kind of highlighted in Drivetrain it's programs running a little bit better than you're expecting as far as new program are certainly your rate cap action, Ron, you tend to be pretty conservative or tight with capital. So it seems like something really positive is it is going on I think that is compliment around what's happening there I mean is it higher volumes and you're expecting our new programs or their actual wins they're manifesting faster than what you thought or say just pull ahead of launches and I'm sure we understand, what's going on there.","James Verrier","Hey, John, by the way, Ron really took that as a big compliment. He loves that comment. So, I think it's a little bit of all frankly I think we've got some of the launches this year a come on maybe are faster ramp some of the volumes have been a little stronger.","So it's now one thing John it's been a combination. I would say the biggest link though between for me between backlog strength on the Drivetrain side. Is the seat a China that's the biggest kind of mover if I can say that way John and that's a function of a real good BCC adoption and success for us in China both with the Chinese domestics and the global guys and that's just pulling forward a little bit as the capital in life for us. And I would say that's probably the biggest piece but generally from the backlog it's been, its strong both cadence and absolute volume.","Ron Hundzinski","John had a couple things. James mentions in the call. This year we're seeing every one of our product lines are growing really well in the past you have a couple product lines that have really good launches and then maybe the other ones are in a cycle where there launches are not hitting this year's here is where every one of our businesses all the launches are hitting and they're hitting at that time that we would hope they would get which is good. And we're getting just tremendous growth across the whole of portfolio and then addition we don't have the headwinds of commercial vehicle to [indiscernible] so it just cost everything.","John Murphy","Okay, that's helpful. Second question on acquisitions I mean Sevcon looks interesting I mean just curious that just you think about Sevcon in potential future acquisitions, you looking for more human capital or products and if you can kind of just linear may be in Sevcon I mean there sounds like double, double your engineers focused on electric Powertrain so, that's sounds good but there also are product suite becomes along with it or you really wasn't to be engineers you're going after an acquisition.","Ron Hundzinski","Yes, that was a good thought John I would say the Sevcon is an example is kind of combination so it brings a revenue stream right if it brings an order book. They bring real product that they have put in boxes and shipping sort us be so it's not just a pure engineers perspective but I would also say clearly they bring to us terrific people capability on the engineering side particularly they bring a lot of that so it's both. And I would say as we look forward John I'm thinking you know more of the same our acquisition focus would be around electronics, power economy capability and we look to obviously add people and talent but our preference also is where we can actually have physical product content where we can particularly around electronics and power electronics. So that's how we thinking about it obviously priority one right now John is to integrate Sevcon and get that up and running well which we're confident in but we're going to keep our eyes and ears open for additional opportunities as well.","John Murphy","And just a one last final question; I mean it looks like a lot of your peers are deepeners or expect going in the opposite direction where there is splitting up ice and sort of electric powertrain components and what kind of position you think that you'll have competitively in the market which you go head-t-head with these folks and will you be advantage or disadvantage by having a full products we have been somewhat agnostic to where Powertrain goes?","James Verrier","Yes, we then obviously I'm a little biased John right but I think we have an incredible advantage. I really do because we're the -- I don't want say the only one but we one of the very few that can go in and discuss with the OEMS. One of the tradeoffs between you knows combustion hybrid and electric architectures and we do it we have those dialogues because we can help them understand. If you put this type to hybrid application into this set of vehicles and you can go electric on this. We are engaged in those conversations because we play across this space and then the other part of the differentiation for us is we then bring the technology that helps them get there. And what they see in a BorgWarner John which I think is really interesting is they know we're not in a lobby and into for in our overly influence them on a pure evil platform or 48 hybrid platform because we play on both so they view us as a neutral partner in that respect but we then follow it up with the content because we have electric motors we have successfully transmissions. We have cabinet and we have all the suite of combustion products and hybrid products so I think and again I'm biased we have a big vantage.","John Murphy","Okay, thank you very much.","James Verrier","Thank you, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from the Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph Spak","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First, just wanted to talk a little bit about the change in backlog relative to the change in CapEx because backlog I think is 50% higher than what you indicated that beginning at the midpoint CapEx is only 10%. So, is that greater efficiency or does it speak to maybe there was just more conservatism on the revenue side versus the capital side?","Ron Hundzinski","Joe this is Ron. Remember that capital that goes in is a ramp cycle of what's happening right. So it's not a direct relationship with the sales increase so it's not fair to say that for a 10% increase in sales you need to 10 % of capital it doesn't work the way you're putting capital over several years. So, the capital tends on the rent side would tend to lag the sales increase because in that my comment as that they was primarily due to ramp increases right net new programs so that tends to lag the sales increase is that clear.","Joseph Spak","Yes.","Ron Hundzinski","It's uplift. It's not new programs yes.","Joseph Spak","Okay, well what about can you reach sort of help us I mentioned how much capital was put in place for a backlog coming in future years or it would seem like not much based on a comment that.","James Verrier","This is a long discussion Joe but typically it follows up on it and how far off with you I get some ratios that would take this offline it's a long discussion, right, Joe.","Joseph Spak","Okay, perfect and I'm then just if you go to like page 11 in the bridge. And I know you made some comments on Commercial vehicle helping I tell you said by 200 basis points is at and then you mentioned market growth was the minus 36 I thought you call that just light vehicle market gross of just this commercial vehicle go in somewhere else in that walk. And then can you also let us know what you're thinking on commercially on off highway first for the fourth quarter embedded in the guidance.","Ron Hundzinski","So commercial vehicle goes under the backlog in the mix the 268 on that slide okay, okay that market is typically more light vehicle; the market growth and pricing, okay. First question and the second one is where so many sort of fourth quarter is although it was a tailwind of a 200 basis points and we're going to go back more to what we saw prior in the year which is about 100 basis points improvement for the fourth quarter for commercial vehicle. Last guidance we had none, this guidance we are going to take a little bit of a tailwind for commercial vehicle but never had we seen in the third quarter.","Joseph Spak","Okay, that's helpful. Thanks, Ron.","Ron Hundzinski","Thanks John.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc.","Brett Hoselton","Good morning gentlemen.","Ron Hundzinski","Good morning Brett.","James Verrier","Good morning Brett.","Brett Hoselton","Let's see I'm talking about your longer term revenue outlook your organic guidance and so forth and then your backlog has been becoming in stronger than expected you're talking quite enthusiastically about some of the higher contented products hybrid electric et cetera and it kind of just begs the question. As we look out over the next five years is could we see BorgWarner's revenue growth accelerating.","Ron Hundzinski","That's a good question I tell you what we laid out at the Investor Day there in New York that 7% guide over the next three years obviously as this year's played out we've just got. We were very comfortable with that outlook. I'm not in a position at this point but I want to start changing next I don't think we need to. But I think that 7% the point CAGER for us is an organic is a good number. Then let's just keep executing at that at least in the short run. We are going to take a good look at it obviously as we go into January plus and we'll provide any update from there but I think at this point I think the 7% organic CAGER is a good number to think about for us.","Brett Hoselton","Okay, and then secondly as we think about the backlog unfolding not necessarily over the next three years but let's say over the next five to ten years and so forth and we think about the move in the direction of from these non IT hard trying to so forth how should we think about margins. You typically is thought about contribution margins but is there the possibility that the margins could be better or worse on these products as we kind of move out into let's say the next five, 10 years.","Ron Hundzinski","So Brett this is Ron. We get this question quite often and we've been addressed in several ways and then again referencing the Investor Day that we had here in August. I had a slide in there if you go back to that presentation I think it is on the website where I gave returns on invested capital are very similar on hybridization in a pure electric products as they are in combustion. And that side was to present that and the reason why we're comfortable is because that slide represents products. That we have been awarded and are starting to ship as well and it's across customers and across regions so, the evidence that we're seeing right now of the programs that we're winning don't substantiate in deterioration in margins or returns.","Brett Hoselton","Okay, excellent. Thank you very much gentlemen.","Ron Hundzinski","Thanks, Brett.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from David Kelley with Jefferies.","David Kelley","Hey, good morning guys.","Ron Hundzinski","Good morning, David.","David Kelley","Just a quick follow up on China. I believe you posted 30% growth Q4 last year the production hurdles a tough one hare you obviously wanting in areas like DCT and with some early model hybrids and electrics. I guess how do we think about some of the puts and takes as we weigh your China opportunity going into year end here and maybe a more difficult hurdle going into '18 as well.","Ron Hundzinski","I would say first of all David, yes that the third quarter strong and we've been running pretty strong through the year and you're right it's driven by a lot of that the technology that you could be referenced so, we ramping well with DCT but it's also on a combustion product line as well. So things good, fourth quarters are more challenge it will be a little bit more of a challenge income but will be over the market so, I would think about a high single to low double digit over the market if that makes sense to so that's how we're thinking and going into fourth quarter and I would think that's a pretty good proxy David for going into next year as well. Think of us high single to low double digit growth over the market in China.","David Kelley","Okay, great. Thanks appreciated. And just a quickly shift gears you referenced potentially accelerating diesel market declines in Q4 it's still early in the ballgame are you seeing that mix shift go to ICE or is it more towards hybrids and EVs and I know you've alluded to it before but maybe if you could remind us on how you see your longer term offset opportunity as we do see that, the mix shift ultimately switch to alternative powertrain and away from diesel.","Ron Hundzinski","Yes, now in the short run David it's clearly diesel out and gasoline in sort to speak. We've talked about this before net for Borg for every hundred bips of shift from diesel to gas. In the short run is had a $20 million, $25 million annual revenue, voice for us frankly which were obviously offsetting in other areas. As it transitions over the next two, three, four years it's a couple of things one it will be even more advanced gasoline engines to be somewhat comparable to diesel technology.","There will be obviously increased hybrid in Europe, so we're going to see that and then longer term in the more four, or five, six, seven year outlook you will see more pure EVs coming into the space, all of that adds up as positive news for us David, so as we go forward we got great content on hybrids and obviously we're growing our electric business. So that's kind of an outlook of how we see it, little bit of short term noise but it's transition into more advanced gas and hybrids and electrics where we'll do fine.","David Kelley","All right, great, thank you. I appreciate you taking my question.","James Verrier","Thank you, David.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Leiker with Baird.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good morning, this is Joe [indiscernible] for David.","James Verrier","Good morning, Joe.","Unidentified Analyst","I had two questions on commercial vehicles; it added two points to your growth am I correct my math would imply that's like 20% growth for your commercial vehicle business, does that sounded all right?","Ron Hundzinski","I haven't broken up between off-road and on-road but that's about right Joe.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And the second question, so it almost feels like five years ago what you went through with automotive and trying to see OEMs plan around greater electrifications, the big heavy duty truck OEMs are all on that stage right now and whether it's Daimler showed a vehicle this week or the others are planning 2019, 2020 that sort of timeframe for launches, what is BorgWarner seeing from in interest perspective, the development perspective and watching either hybrid electric or peer electric commercial vehicles and by what timeframe you expect that?","Ron Hundzinski","We're seeing a lot of interest actually around electrification in the commercial vehicle space, we put in the deck actually the Scania win on our drivemotor there for that particular bus application, so we're seeing increased interest Joe across the space and we see obviously Urban Bus type environment is particularly attractive, U.S. we see small and mid sized truck applications again predominantly more CDR, so we're seeing that and if you think about it, a lot of technology that we have on the light vehicle side is leveragable over to the commercial vehicle space, drive motor is being a good example of that.","So we're seeing it, I think we will probably have a better view Joe when we do a backlog showing in January because you know there we'll break it down by technology and we will break it down a little bit by and talk about it by end markets. So that will be a good point to kind of break it down a little more for you but directionally we're seeing a significant increase in electrification and in commercial vehicle and we're participating strongly in it.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Stover with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Ron Hundzinski","Hello, Matt.","Operator","Matt Stover, your line is open.","Matthew Stover","Apologies for mute.","Ron Hundzinski","Okay, go ahead.","Matthew Stover","Apologies, you addressed but just wanted to talk about it in overtime the return on capital of the company has been pretty good and over the last few years for a variety of reasons, it's sort of moved to a lower level but we're seeing some stability here and I'm wondering as you sort of think through the new revenue opportunities that are emerging for you over the course of let's say the next two to five years, if you think that there is an ability for you to sort of rethink the capital intensity or the profit profile of those businesses would allow the company to resume its previous investment class returns on capital?","James Verrier","Matt, this is James. I'll give you, I guess, at least my quick high take and then Ron can weigh in, as you rightly pointed out what service company really, really well is that after tax 15% ROIC threshold and hurdle and that's not, we continue to drive that metric pretty relentlessly, so I would start there and say that through minds the core and the primary metric for us. Ron might want to add specifically around cash flow, if you want to talk about?","Ron Hundzinski","Our capital deployment in general, I think with the organization going forward is going to have to do is we're going to have to take a look at our product lines and determine which product lines get more capital and which product lines started to not have as much capital as the portfolio starts the evolve and changes in different direction. But, as James mentioned, as we go through their process we will reallocate resources but we are not going to give up on the go of 15% after tax return that's not going to happen. We will redeploy our capital in the right resources in the growth to achieve the growth that we have in our portfolio. But, we are not going to give up on that return metric.","Matthew Stover","Okay. Thank you.","James Verrier","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","Your next question comes from Richard Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities.","Richard Kwas","Hi, good morning everyone.","James Verrier","Hi, good morning Rich.","Richard Kwas","I will take another -- a little different strategy and the backlog. So, going back at the beginning of the year the mid-point was 500 million, you are going to be not quite double have it almost I mean I am imagining it has some expectation you could out perform the top end of your initial range, but anyway to think about how what your internal expectations were versus what's actually happened?","James Verrier","I mean I would say, Rich, you know, we are -- obviously first of all, we are -- obviously -- yes we are ahead its coming stronger, it's coming stronger. But what I would also say Rich is, you know, you remember the history here and how we got to the methodology around the development of backlog. And I don't want to go back all the time and in history, but, you know, we took an approach where the roll up for the data was the same, but we were maybe a little more prudent around the cadence and volumes over the launches and we also, you know, built in some, you know, macro stuff, so I think we took that approach and I think that has helped us. But, I think even with that said, from an internal perspective, you know, we are definitely running a little better ahead them what we had anticipated and I think its really what Ron said, it's a combination of, you know, across all of our products and across all of our regions we have just add, you know, the ramps either been little bit quicker or the volumes have been a little stronger and when you add all that up around the world and across the products you get to the kind of results that we are at. So, yes, it's pleasing.","Richard Kwas","I know you said, your cross products and regions but DCP seems like its one the areas that probably will contribute a little bit more than average and I know there are some positive payback, which is given their delays in prior years with by customers and what not so. Is that a fair assessment?","James Verrier","I think that's a good, that's a good perspective, which, you know, we have seen, you know, the ramp has been little better and stronger. And I think, you know, so your point about history probably couldn't blame as for been, you know, it had conservative in that space based on, you know, the ramp has taken a few years to get where it maybe -- but that's a fewer assessment is a good one right.","Richard Kwas","Okay, great. And then, last one just on Sevcon, so we get back the penny impact the negative impacts in the quarter, do we just kind of flow that through on the quarterly basis for '18, just big picture?","James Verrier","At this point, I think that's probably a good assumption Rich, we are going to find soon there are updated. We do think that you moderate a little bit going forward, but I think it -- you are going to have give me clarity probably in January.","Richard Kwas","Okay, thank you.","James Verrier","Thanks, Richard.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays.","Brian Johnson","Good morning. Dallas got a kind of bigger question. So, I think there has been through training and swamp on backlog, you know, the books wagons putting some of those businesses into our something that potentially could be by now I mean 20 years after the US OEMs to debt and this forma Delphi of course the Honeywell transaction, the spin-off of Delphi so just because you look at broadly the powertrain space given here that the challenge of kind of managing the transition from ice given the challenge and see a huge ACN, American Actual Data, all investing in the e-modules make that look longer, do you think that this is an industry that's going to consolidate over the next 10 years and its so, what role do you BorgWarner playing in that kind of consolidation?","James Verrier","Yes, no, it's good, Brian. I am going to try and give you the best answer I can. But, I am going to stop with something that I think I said in the last -- and that is I love our proportion business, I really do, I am very, very happy with where we have positioned ourselves and the product lines that we have got. I see there is a great future for the proportion guys like us and the reason for that is, our balance again across combustion hybrid and electric. We are agnostics to those shifts Brian if there is a quick fast acceleration of EB penetration that's fine we have great products there. If hybrids becomes a predominate architecture that's fine. So, we are beautifully positioned on whatever that evolution and shift is, you know, in terms of, you know, as our plays out in terms of consolation and who wants to keep what core that I don't know, what I know the one thing that I do know is we are proportion company we are very happy with that, we don't plan to do anything different than be a leading proportion company. I get to let the other guys do what they are going to do, but we are just going to crawl the heck out of our proportion business across all of the, all of the big [technical difficulty].","Brian Johnson","As you look across creative landscape I mean are there redundant or do you mean capital investments going across competitors and OEM as it something where it could use consolidation just not so much for a strategic but just maximizing the cash flows even everyone is making roughly the same products -- product investments?","James Verrier","I am not so sure. I wouldn't want to speculate too much Brian, you know, the one thing I would also use when you get down to the real core technology in portion, you know, over abundance of players in the space. So, if you think of -- think about business and think how many guys are on the planet or how many turbo guys who are on the planet for DC module -- on the planet you know, there is so many right, when you get to other, you know, less differentiated products. So, I use that example of thermostat, that's a little bit of a different story. So, I think, you know, individual discrete product lines made lend itself that but I think when you look at the core of the propulsion, whether it's a electric hybrid or combustion. There is not an over abundance of course in my opinion, Brian.","Brian Johnson","Okay. Thanks.","James Verrier","Thank you.","James Verrier","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore ISI.","Chris McNally","Thanks, gentlemen, and congrats again on this the good year and driving the detail on the PF side, and it's been really helpful for the call. I wanted to thank you just a follow up to the China question with a couple questions ago, you know, remembering that China was one of the issues that we only 15 on some of the new launch volumes. How do we start to think about China in 2018 but, you know we have seem that Chinese stronger growth from 18 to 25 million. Is it crazy to fuel the 2018 could be down sort of low to the mid-single digits in China and if that's the case, you know, how do you start to scenario planned, you know, around just a temporary blip in production and new launches, you know, you can start to grow again later in the year and going forward?","James Verrier","Yes, I though as we get to think about 2018 heat is up, you know, I think you are going to see modest growth in large circulation production in China, you know 1% or 2% we are not certain exactly the number. Yes, the days of 6% to 8% percent I think are behind us. So, from a market perspective here in a 1% or 2% growth environment for China next year, but we are in excess of that, you know, we are going to be high single to low double-digit growth over and above that market. So, even if there was a little bit adjustment in China ran flat slightly down for a year or so, you know, we are still going to be delivering a very significant growth that driven by, you know, penetration story of about products. So, not a big deal frankly if China is off a couple of percent next year what we are focused on is launching flawlessly a products that are driving the high growth first in China.","Chris McNally","I think that's great. And its fair to say that, the comments that you have been making about drivetrain with, you know, some of the all over drive and DCT growing, the launch cans, is it still pretty good specifically in China as we think about 18 and 19 but its still as good as was in sort of the last four quarters, but if China is specific for driving train, you know, still a nice a new backlog new launch cadence over the next, you know, the next year or two?","James Verrier","Yes, it is, you know, specifically if you think about that we, you know, one of our big launches and the growth stories there in drivetrain is with Great Wall on a dual-clutch technology, and if you think about this really only been ramping in the third quarter and they will be ramping further in the fourth; next year that ramp is going to continue to decline, and then obviously we have been putting in capacity to support Volkswagen in China, and that's also in early ramp mode. So you are going to get that -- that's going to be a tailwind for us as we go forward. So, yes, still a lot of opportunity for growth for us in drivetrain in China.","Chris McNally","Okay, thank you so much.","James Verrier","Thank you.","Ron Hundzinski","Thank you.","Operator","We have time for one final question, and that question comes from Richard Hilgert with Morningstar.","Richard Hilgert","Good morning, guys.","James Verrier","Good morning, Richard.","Richard Hilgert","Congrats on the quarter. Hey, I was thinking about you know, the comments earlier in the prepared remarks about you know, the phenomenon that we are seeing with crossover sport utility vehicles outside of North America, and the tremendous growth that we have seen in these products, not only in Europe, but in South America and Russia, in China. And with the changeover in powertrain to both hybrid or battery electric, given the way that the portfolio is set up now, do you envision at some point potentially more products coming on you know, the torque delivery side to match some of these new energy powertrains that we are seeing to go into the crossover segment, and is that an area that you could potentially see some additional growth rates on top of what you have already forecasted for the longer term growth?","James Verrier","Yes, Richard, let me shut that up for you. I think you know, first of all, your observations are right on. We do see globally in our shift to more SUVs and obviously here in the United States light truck or truck is strong. Directionally, it's helpful for BorgWarner, because it does offer the opportunity as you say for more all-wheel drive content and transportation specifically obviously for four-wheel drive applications. So, it does. I mean directionally it does help us with larger vehicles and SUVs on the drive trend side. But so yes, I think the quick answer is yes, Richard, we do see that as a slight tailwind. I would say it's best to think of we probably factored that into our -- of data we gave back in New York. So I'm not seeing that necessarily in the short run as necessarily upside-upside, I think that's already reflected in our projections that we gave in New York, which is that 7% CAGR you know, at the midpoint for us over the next three years, Richard.","Richard Hilgert","Okay. On the Sevcon side, converters, the high-voltage, low-voltage products that got there, and the software that goes behind that seems to me like you know, the battery chargers is probably the area that you might have been referring to with respect to what might not be core to BorgWarner's business, but I was wondering you know, the sort of development behind that, is there anything there that might give you some expertise on working with your OEM customers on how the battery energy flows you know, coming in and then optimizing going out for the output. Is there anything there that you would want to retain from that aspect of Sevcon that could help you further develop that business?","James Verrier","Yes, so a couple of thoughts, Richard. One is the non-core product line I was referring to earlier was in our emissions business, which is thermostats and pipes. So, certainly nothing -- I'm not disclosing anything non-core at all on the Sevcon side. As you alluded to, the power electronics capabilities is particularly core to us, because that is where we are going to be able to integrate that power electronics into the products and systems and modules as we go forward, because that's critical to us. You know, the battery charging piece of the business is also very interesting for us. It's fair to say, I would describe it his way, that's the one we -- you know, we don't know so much about yet candidly. So we are going to get in and work with the Sevcon team and better understand what the opportunities are for that piece of the business. But overall, Sevcom is a wonderful acquisition for us, and it's really going to help accelerate our efforts in power electronics and system capabilities. So, positive on that.","Richard Hilgert","Okay, great. Thank you very much for taking my questions.","James Verrier","Thank you, Richard.","James Verrier","With that, I would like to thank you all for your great questions today, and sharing it for the course of the call.","Operator","That does conclude the BorgWarner 2017 third quarter results conference call.

You'll find the link in the Events and Presentations section beneath the notice for this call. We encourage you to follow on during our discussion.","With that, I'll turn it over to James.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you, Patrick, and good day to everybody. Thanks for joining the call. Ron and I are obviously very pleased today to be able to share our results from Q2 2017, and we'll obviously update you on our progress towards delivering our targets for 2017.","I'd like to start, if I can, by sharing a few thoughts on the macro environment in the industry. For those of you following along on the slideshow, this will be slide number 7. So what we've seen really is, we do still recognize some instability in many aspects from a macro perspective. But I would say, in general, the outlook for the auto industry is, I would say, in line or modestly weaker than our expectations going into the quarter. So let me break that down a little bit.","Global light vehicle production flattish in Q2 with production down about 1.5% for our adjusted geographic exposure. We saw European light vehicle production declining approximately 4%, which actually was slightly better than our expectations as we headed into the quarter. China light vehicle production was down about 1%, slightly weaker than our expectations going into the quarter. And North America light vehicle industry production declined about 3% against slightly weaker than our expectations going into the quarter.","If I give a little bit of an outlook for the market as we see the rest of this year playing out, as usual, we are closely aligned with IHS. So we see light vehicle production in China at about 1% growth, we see Europe up around 2%, and we see North American production down a little over 2%. If you weigh that for that global production for our geographic exposure, that means growth of less than 1% for us.","A word on commercial vehicle. We see the outlook for Europe and China continuing to improve. I would say that we have seen expectations for North America growth moderate a little.","Just to share a few thoughts on what we're probably paying a lot of attention to. I would say, obviously where we are in the North American cycle is pretty clear in our minds. We do see schedules have weakened a little bit, although I would describe it as pretty modestly, and we continued to watch and monitor inventory levels.","Clearly for us diesel\/gas mix is important in Europe, and we continue to see that shift occurring during Q2. So what we see is, diesel share declined approximately 390 bps year-over-year in Q2, and we expect diesel\/gas mix to continue through the end of the decade shifting. The good news out from a BorgWarner perspective is, we continue to offset that headwind. China, we still look forward to modest growth in the year 2017. But more importantly, from a BorgWarner perspective, that growth above that market continues to be very strong, driven by increase in share and content per vehicle. So all of this said, if you wrap it altogether, we remain very confident in our outgrowth of the market in 2017 based on the strong demand for our products.","Let me spend a moment on regulatory and technology outlook. The strong drive for fuel economy and emissions regulations does not slowdown at all. We continue to see a pretty hard pace of movement there, and it's all around advanced propulsion technology. We see activity increasing particularly in gas engine technology, hybrid technology and EV technology and, rest assured, we're very busy in those fields with all of our customers around the world.","And we see the transition to electrification continues. Our Q2 new business bookings continue to show additional awards with a wide variety of customers, regions and propulsion systems. And rather than dwell on that too much today, what we plan to do is share a lot more of that detail with you at the upcoming Investor Day, that Pat referred to, on August 7th.","Let me now move to slide 8 and talk a little bit about a financial recap. And clearly, Ron will take you through a lot more detail than I will, but let me just start out by talking about our Q2. I was very, very pleased with our Q2 performance. Our growth exceeded the high end of our guidance, and our operating performance was very much in line with our expectations. $2.4 billion of sales, that's representative of 7.8% organic growth when we exclude FX and Remy. And that compares to our light vehicle and market exposure, down about 1.5%. So, a very, very strong top-line performance.","Regionally, it was pretty much as we had expected from a BorgWarner point of view with strong growth in China, driven primarily by DCT, and we grew very well in North America both through new business and mix. Europe for us was flattish, which is strong performance when you look to the industry production declines. And this light vehicle growth was supplemented by positive revenue trends in commercial vehicle off-road. That led us to a strong EPS performance of $0.96 when we exclude non-comparable items and an impressive operating margin of 12.5%.","If I look at it a little deeper by segment, the highlight for me was, I was really excited to see the growth across all of our products. So, from an engine perspective, $1.4 billion was our sales, which represents 4.5% organic growth. Some of the highlights, we did see very strong growth in timing systems and thermal products. And again, despite the changes to the diesel\/gas mix shift, we've seen top-line growth in our engine business.","Drivetrain sales came in at $921 million, which is up 13.9% organically. This was driven by strong all-wheel drive, DCT and transmission sales in North America, China, and Europe.","Let me move forward and talk a little bit about the outlook for 2017. I'm pleased to say we're increasing our revenue and our earnings forecast for 2017. We now expect our organic growth to be between 6.5% to 7.5% year-over-year versus our prior guidance of 3.5% to 6%. Again, this compares to the market growing less than 1%.","Our consolidated operating income margin is expected to expand 30 basis points to 40 basis points, and our EPS guidance range is now at $3.65 per diluted share to $3.70 per diluted share, which is up from $3.50 per diluted share to $3.60 per diluted share previously.","If we can turn to slide 9 for those of you who following along, I'll just highlight a couple of key growth areas. I just thought it would be worthwhile spending a moment to focus on two of the product announcements that we've got there. The dual-clutch and control modules for Great Wall Motors is a really important one for us, and this business is now ramping nicely. I had the pleasure to be in China just a couple of weeks ago to see this in action, and I was really impressed to see the move forward on DCT in China.","The 48-volt eBooster, critical technology launch for us with Daimler on their 3.0-liter gasoline engine, and this is a very important technology for hybrid vehicles. And one of the things that's important about this, it's a great example of BorgWarner at its best. So we've got our leading-edge turbocharger technology for integrating our power electronics knowhow, so we can offer Daimler a real true systems solution. These are just two examples. I could go on and on, and we won't. Again, we'll share more with you at Investor Day. But the message really for us is, our balanced approach is working. We continue to see very good win rates across all types of propulsion systems, combustion, hybrid and electric.","On slide 10, let me just recap or share a few highlights on our recent announcement on the acquisition of Sevcon. This is a really important move for us. Sevcon is a global player in electrification technologies, including power electronics. And I really believe this acquisition supports our existing strategy to supply leading technology for all types of propulsion systems; combustion, hybrid and electric. And we consider the power electronics design and development knowhow to be a core expertise, and we believe that Sevcon complements BorgWarner's existing or power electronics capabilities.","Also very importantly for us, we believe the acceleration of our power electronics capabilities strengthens our position to satisfy the customers by providing more electrified systems that they are sourcing both near- and long-term. So more to come on this at a later date. We do expect the enterprise value at about $200 million. And we anticipate closing this in Q4. More to come on that later.","So before I hand over to Ron, let me just kind of summarize from my perspective. Q2 is a very good quarter for us. We exceeded our expectations for both top-line growth, and operating performance is in line with our expectation. And given our strong first half performance, we feel comfortable about increasing our revenue and EPS guidance for the year despite a modestly weaker industry production outlook.","We absolutely believe that the company is positioned to deliver mid-to-high single digit growth over the long-term, and I look forward to meeting with many of you in \u2013 August 7 in New York, where we can share more details with you.","And with that, let me turn the call over to Ron.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Before I review the financial details, I would like to provide you some of the highlights as I've seen for the quarter.","First, it was another strong quarter, actually it was a great quarter. Second, operating performance was as we expected. And finally, given the strong first half of the year performance, we are confident in raising our full year guidance.","Now as Pat mentioned, I will be referring to the supplemental financial slide deck, which is posted on our IR website. I do encourage you to follow along.","Let's turn to slide 12. On a reported basis, sales were up 2.6%. On a comparable basis, our organic sales was up 7.8%. This was approximately 130 basis points ahead of the high-end of our guidance.","Our weighted average light vehicle industry production was down more than 1%. So we saw also a 25% growth in China, against a production market that was down about 1%. Commercial vehicle was of benefit as well, contributing more than 100 basis points. The primary headwinds versus our expectations were diesel\/gas mix in Western Europe and market share loss by our largest Korean customer in China and North America markets.","Before I move to the operating profit, I would like to discuss our gross profit and SG&A line items. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 21.5% in the quarter, up 20 basis points from a year ago. SG&A was 9% of sales. R&D spending, which is included in SG&A, was 4.4% of sales. SG&A was up 30 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by R&D and the timing of stock-based compensation.","Now let's look at the year-over-year comparison for operating income, which can be found on slide 13. Q2 operating profit was $300 million or 12.5% of sales compared to $287 million in Q2 of 2016, which was 12.3% of sales, resulting in a 20 basis point improvement. On an organic basis, operating income was up $18 million on $176 million of higher sales. That give us an incremental margin of 10% in the quarter and in line with our expectations.","As you look further down the income statement, equity and affiliate earnings was about $14 million in the quarter, up $4 million from last year. Interest expense and finance charges were $18 million in the quarter, down about $3 million from last year due to lower debt levels. Excluding the $10 million one-time favorable tax adjustment, the provision for income taxes was $86 million for an effective tax rate of 29% for the quarter.","Net earnings attributable to non-controlling interest was about $9 million, down $2 million from the second quarter of 2016. This line item reflects our minority partner share in the earnings and performance of our Korean and Chinese consolidated joint ventures. Earnings per share on a reported basis was $1 per diluted share. On a comparable basis, net earnings were $0.96 per diluted share.","Now let's take a closer look at our operating segments in the quarter beginning on slide 14. Reported Engine segment net sales were $1.482 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the Engine segment on a comparable basis was 4.5% as demand for our light vehicle OEM products was supplemented, again, by growth in our commercial vehicle business. Adjusted EBIT was $244 million for the Engine segment or 16.5% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Engine segment's adjusted EBIT was up $12 million on $65 million of sales for an incremental margin of 18%.","Turning to slide 15 and starting from the right. Drivetrain segment net sales were $921 million in the quarter. This includes the reduction of $77 million of sales from the divestiture of the Remy light vehicle aftermarket. Sales growth for Drivetrain segment on a comparable basis was up 13.8%, primarily due to higher all-wheel drive transmission components and strong DCT growth in China.","Adjusted EBIT was $110 million for the Drivetrain segment or 11.9% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Drivetrain segment's adjusted EBIT was up $16 million on $133 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 14%. I'd like to take a moment to discuss incremental margins a bit more.","Our total company incremental margin for Q2 was 10%, which is below our long-term goal of mid-teens, but was slightly improved from our quarter one performance. In order to better understand this, there are a few items we should highlight. First, segment incremental margins. The Engine segment incremental margins were 18%, which is good performance. We were particularly happy with the performance here as we continue to have operational issues in our emissions business.","Our Drivetrain segment incremental margins were 14%, which was up from 13% in Q1 and 11% in Q4, strong performance as we continue to ramp launching programs in this business. As a result, the segment incremental margins were 15%.","So, corporate costs were basically flat sequentially and are expected to moderate in the third and fourth quarters, but was up about $9 million year-over-year. The drivers of this increase continue to be the timing of additional stock-based compensation cost and various advisory fees for tax and legal planning. These items unfavorably impacted incremental margins by approximately 500 basis points in the quarter.","Now, let's take a look at our balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $399 million of net cash from operating activities in the first half of the year, up $37 million from the first half of 2016. Capital spending was $254 million year-to-date, up $20 million from a year ago. Free cash flow, which we define as net cash from operating activities less net capital spending, was $145 million, up $17 million from 2016.","Looking at the balance sheet itself, balance sheet debt was flat and cash decreased by $57 million compared with the end of 2016. The $57 million increase in net debt was primarily due to return of capital activities. Our net debt to net capital ratio was 33.2% at the end of Q2, down slightly from 35% at the end of 2016. Net debt to EBITDA at the end of the quarter was 1.16 times.","Now, let's discuss our 2017 guidance, which we have increased. So let's start with our sales growth guidance for the full year on slide 17. Backlog, pricing and market-related growth are expected to drive 6.5% to 7.5% organic sales growth. Currency is expected to reduce sales by $100 million. The first half backlog was very strong, and this amount is flowing through in our increased guidance.","So, I'd like to note a few items which are impacting our second half organic growth relative to our first half as I suspect many of you will ask questions on this. So, first, North America mix changes from the key North American programs, some of which are changeover-related or having modernization issues on us in the second half. Diesel production relative to sales are also having an impact to us in the second half. Continued volume reduction from our largest South Korean customer in China and North America, and North America commercial vehicle modernization from the first half are all the items that we see in the second half of our guide.","Many of these items are timing related when you look at the first half and second half. Overall, 6.5% to 7.5% organic growth for the year is very strong, given the industry backdrop and stronger than our expectations going into the year.","Next, I'll walk our operating income on slide 18. From a performance perspective, we continue to expect mid-teens incremental margins on our sales growth. Included in this are some headwinds from corporate costs, and we continue to expect an inflationary environment and compliance cost. Our consolidated operating income margin is expected to expand by 30 basis points to 40 basis points.","To finish up the full year guidance, please turn to slide 19. EPS range is now $3.65 per diluted share to $3.70 per diluted share. The $0.12 increase is driven by our sales guide increase. Free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx, is expected to be $450 million to $500 million.","Capital spending, including tooling, is expected to be in the range of $500 million to $550 million, which is up slightly to support several program lists basically that increased earnings and cash flows being offset by the increase in CapEx and cash flow.","Given our announcement of Sevcon, acquisition of our share repurchase program will be about $100 million in 2017. R&D spending as a percentage of sales is expected to be 4% in 2017. The tax rate is expected to be 29%. Our assumption for the dollar to euro exchange rate has been adjusted to $1.10 from $1.05. As a reminder, every $0.01 change in the dollar-to-euro exchange rate equals about $30 million to $35 million. I'm aware that the exchange rate is about $1.16, but $1.10 is an average rate for the year.","Our third quarter guidance is starting on slide 21. First, sales. Note that Remy light vehicle aftermarket sales divested are $68 million. So, starting at a base of $2.146 billion, net new business, pricing and market-related growth are expected to drive organic sales growth from about 3% to 6%. Currency is expected to reduce sales growth by about $36 million. Therefore, 2017 Q3 sales is expected to be $2.2 billion at the midpoint.","From an EPS perspective, on slide 22, we expect $0.03 to $0.06 per share from backlog, foreign currencies are expected to lower earnings by about $0.02 a share in the quarter. Below the operating income line items are expected to contribute $0.05 per share from lower share count and a lower tax rate. On a consolidated basis, we expect earnings of $0.84 to $0.87 per share.","So, let me summarize the quarter. It was a strong second quarter and the first half for the year as well. Organic sales growth was nearly 8%, despite declining industry volume. Incremental margins improved slightly sequentially and then as we expected. We anticipate this to improve in the second half of the year.","As we look at 2017 and beyond, we continue to drive intensity around new product development and support it with acquisitions to participate in the impending electrification trend. There is no question that this will drive growth for many years.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat.","Patrick Nolan - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you, Ron. Sharon, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on the quarter.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Good morning, Joe.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Good morning, Joe.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I guess, I just wanted to \u2013 the one thing which I guess has changed a little bit was margin expansion for the year a little bit less, it looks like there might be \u2013 and some of the FX flow through, is that some of the transaction along with the translation impact or is there something else going on there?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","That's correct. What happens with FX even though there is a benefit from our prior guide, we only pull about $0.12 on the dollar, 12% incremental versus operating incremental of mid-teens. So, there tends to be a drag on us on margins going forward from the incremental margins.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Right. Right. Right. And then, you clearly saw point into the margin expansion for the rest of the year. It looks like based on your guidance a little bit more fourth quarter than the third quarter, so I was wondering what \u2013 is that just mostly volume that's driving that? I mean, and also by segment, maybe you could provide a little bit more color, because I think you've got some tougher incremental margin comps in Engine, but some easier ones in Drivetrain, so I just wanted to get a little more of the picture there?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah, Joe, a lot of parts moving. So, first of all, your question about the fourth quarter is correct, more margin expansion in the fourth. One item, I keep talking about the corporate cost, we love to have corporate cost. And we may even be lower than the prior year in corporate cost. So we get the full benefit of the operating segment's contribution margin. So that would be more of an uplift in the absolute margin for us in the fourth quarter.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","You're talking about the fourth quarter corporate costs?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah, yeah. This is mostly...","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Of last year. Right. Okay.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yes, it's most in the fourth quarter. And then also we get a little bit of volume that the DCT plant's really starting to hum along. So once that starts coming along, that might get a little higher incremental for us as well, which is in the Drivetrain segment. So, a combination of few items.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you, Joe.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everybody.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Hi, Rod. How are you?","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","A couple of things, just \u2013 maybe you could just talk about on the guidance for the year. Noticed that the midpoint of your backlog guidance is $715 million, and you've done about two-thirds of that in the first half. And the backlog is only \u2013 the assumption is only $100 million to $150 million in Q3. Is there some conservatism that you're baking into that number or are you including, for example, I think, a significant amount of the backlog right now that's being driven by China?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","So, Rod, it's Ron. You're right. The original guidance was \u2013 I'm going to round numbers a little bit on you. It was $0.5 billion \u2013 $500 million, and now the organic guide implies about $715 million, you're right. So, it's about $200 million increase. What we're seeing in the second half? I listed a bunch of items in there. We're seeing some that wasn't anticipated actually until just recently. One of our largest Korean customers is having a difficult time, especially in the back half of the year in China and North America. We're anticipating that commercial vehicle is going to moderate as well. We also have a changeover that's in North America in one of our largest customers' platforms that they've announced quite frankly yesterday, that's also going to be a little bit of a headwind for us.","So we're seeing a few things in the back half of the year that are headwinds. But if you really go back to our original guidance, that guidance include about $100 million per quarter, roughly $125 million, of backlog. So, we haven't adjusted that, right, at the end of the day. So, it's still outgrowth and we haven't really adjusted from the original guidance. I think you got to look at the full year organic growth is how you got to look at it, not the cadence by first half, second half.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I understand, but maybe just to clarify, when you talk about these headwinds from diesel or a crane customer whatever, do you put that into the market growth in bucket or do you put that as a net against your backlog bucket?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","That would net out of \u2013 a little bit in market, but we probably net it out of the backlog number.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","For Korea, there were some launches we anticipated, and was hard to bifurcate between the two buckets. We're just kind of splitting hairs here. So we can get back with you on that, Rod.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And just secondly, the margin improvement in Drivetrain. As I recall, there were two factors that were a pretty big drag on Drivetrain; one was the DCT plant in China that was ramping, and you also were, I think, shifting some capacity to Eastern Europe. Are those now behind you, and how should we be thinking about the margin targets for Drivetrain and what kind of timeframe should we be thinking?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah, Rod, this is James. In terms of your couple of points on the activity around Drivetrain, the transition into Eastern Europe is kind of done and behind us, that's all done up. And the ramp in China for DCT is, it really starts to move forward a lot more in the second half of this year or certainly in the fourth quarter, and we'll really see more of that benefit even more so as we go into 2018. So I think, they're both largely behind us now, Rod, and we've got forward momentum.","Where that takes the Drivetrain margin for the longer-term? I tend to think of it is, we're just going to continue at the mid-teen incremental type of a rate in Drivetrain, and that will just continue to follow-up, which is we deliver on that volume.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thanks, Rod.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you, Rod.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Leiker with Baird.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Good morning. How are you doing?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Morning, David.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Good, David.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","I guess, two things, just on the diesel\/gas, open Pandora's box here. Now to the extent that diesel declines and, yeah, you're seeing some \u2013 I mean, we talk to people, I'm sure you talk to people, who say, vehicles are going to banned, what's going to happen. The reality though is, this gas\/diesel shift can't happen quickly, because the capacity is not there, is it, to replace diesel engines with gas engines in the next two years?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","So, yeah, let me give a bit of color on that, David. Obviously what we've seen this year is that acceleration obviously has continued. It was 400 \u2013 close to 400 bps in the quarter. And we do see that shift moving on. There is some kind of \u2013 to your point, some natural limit of timing of how this plays out. We can't just convert everything over from diesel to gas. There are capacity constraints, et cetera, et cetera.","I think, the bigger important issue is so as they shift from diesel to gas, what are they doing? And they're using that...","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Right.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","...in many cases as an opportunity to put \u2013 to accelerate some of the advanced gasoline engine program timing. They're looking to pull forward some of the hybrid program timing, and that's a benefit to BorgWarner, because we're going to be content additive on those products versus diesel. So that's what we're seeing play out. In the short run, it's a little bit of noise, and you see we've more than overcome that again in the second quarter. And on a go-forward basis, it's certainly neutral to positive for BorgWarner.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Do your customers in their Engine plants have the ability to switch over? Let's say there's an Engine plant that's got four diesel lines? Can they shift one line at a time? Or do they have to do the whole plant at a time? How does this \u2013 strategically how does that play out?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yes. I think probably each one is somewhat different to be open, David, but I think obviously the first call is utilization of existing gas capacity. And they have to get that filled up and utilize that. And then, it just gets into the detail of what individual customer has in terms of capacity utilization.","But to go invest in a brand-new engine gasoline line obviously is a pretty hefty lead time on that type of move, which is I think what you're inferring. So that the play right now is leverage and utilize fully the gas capacity. And then beyond that, obviously that's a longer \u2013 a little bit of a longer lead time for them.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","And the, the last item here is, if you look at \u2013 as your customers do \u2013 that they're probably going to take down the lower efficiency diesel and shift them over to higher efficiency gas. And as they do that transition to a fully-loaded downsize turbocharged DDI, EGR engine, how does your content differ between those two?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Not just current Engine business, but what they would replace it with?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. A couple of thoughts, Dave, just \u2013 I think, you're right, to clarify. So where the acceleration is obviously on the diesel decline is in the smaller engines. In terms of the bigger engines, two-liter and above, we've not seeing such a dramatic shift.","But clearly, you're right, what they're doing with those smaller engines \u2013 what they're going to look to do is to make those advanced as possible. So that's more variable about timing, that's putting gasoline EGR technology on those vehicles, more advanced turbos. That's going to be net positive for BorgWarner, because we're going to put more content on those than smaller diesels that we have today.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks for your time.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thanks, David.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thanks, David.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Good morning.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Hey, Brett.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","You talked about the organic revenue growth and kind of the cadence through 2017. I'm wondering how do we think \u2013 if we're exiting 2017 maybe at a little slower pace, how do we think about 2018?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. The way I would think about it, Brett \u2013 and again, we'll talk a little more about this in New York in a couple of weeks. But as you can see even in the first two quarters, there's a little bit of a spread there, right, in terms of our organic growth. And then, that's also a little different in the backup.","What I would suggest you do is think of it as the full year of 2017 is a good basis way to think of it, because there is some little bit of volatility and noise through the quarters. So if you just take the 7% organic growth, which is the midpoint of our new guide, on a full year basis, that's how I would be thinking of it in terms of a launch into 2018 and beyond.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","I'd like to add something, James. And then the reason, Brett, is unlike last year where our backlog was concentrated on maybe four, five heavy launches. This year it's more dispersed. It's a wider width of launches that are going on. And that breadth is \u2013 it's hard to predict by the cadence exactly through the quarter, and it was more front-end loaded.","So the two years are different years in backlogs. But James is right, I think you got to look at the full year as you go into 2018, what we did for 2017.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And as far as incremental margins into 2018, is there anything that you think of that may be a significant tailwind or headwind, FX, that sort of thing?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","One area is the emissions business. It's been a continue issue for us, it's not performing well. And we're going to have to fix that. That's one that comes very quick to mind is that business.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","But I would \u2013 Brett, I wouldn't be thinking much different to admit. We don't see anything coming off our mid-teen incremental margin approach at all as we go into 2018.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. You're right there.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you, gentlemen.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thanks, Brett.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Hi, John.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a quick question. I mean, obviously the schedules in the quarter maybe deteriorated a little bit, I mean, and there's lot of concern about what's going to happen with the cycle in the U.S. and potential risk in China. As you react to these changes, just curious if you can remind us what sort of leverage you have to pull through to really react? But also, very importantly, as we're seeing mix shift away from cars and towards crossovers, what kind of benefit is that highlighting to you? Because it seems like you maybe disconnecting more from these aggregate schedules than you have been in the past few years, and this mix might be a huge benefit, all up sort of that 25% growth in China against the negative 1% market, it seems like you're really disconnecting?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","John, if you think \u2013 the two markets you're referring to China and North America, very candidly what it means for us right now, if we see moderations in shift and schedule, we just slow our growth a little. And that's kind of an important thing for us. It's not like we're going into reduction modes. So we've been running mid-teen growth in China. So if there's a little bit of a softening there, you can run 10%-ish type growth, and we've been outperforming in North America too.","So, it's not that we're not paying attention, John, because we are, and we'll tweak as we need to locally at schedule levels and plant levels. But fundamentally for the company, we're in growth mode in North America, we're in growth mode in China. We got to be thoughtful about it, but that's kind of how we're outpricing as a company in 2017 and likely into 2018 as well, John.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I'm sorry. But also the mix change, I mean, it seems like you're kind of sloughing the stuff of, because mix seems to be improving and your backlog is coming through. I'm just curious that the things which you're getting from mix...","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. Sorry, John, I missed that one. Net-net, we're a little bit beneficial with truck mix in North America. Vehicle mix in China is less noise for us. But North America, we get a slight benefit with truck mix, but it's not huge. Because generally our content is pretty equal across cars and trucks. We just get the added benefit of transfer case technology going on to the trucks, which kind of gives us a bit of a lift there. But it's not \u2013 to your point, John, it's not moving the needle dramatically for us, which is a good thing for us.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thank you.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from Colin Langan with UBS.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Can you give us any color on your commercial traffic merger? I know, in the past, there was almost 10% of sales. Is it still substantial today and is that recovery a nice underlying help to results here, given it seems like those commercial on-off highway markets have improved?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah, Colin, this is James. It's about 12% of revenue. For us, it's a total company for 2017. And it's split pretty equally between on-road and off-road is the way to think of this. We have about a third North America, a third Europe, and then the other third is split between China and South America.","And as I've said in my comments earlier, Colin, what we've seen is, it's been a tailwind for us, particularly in China and in Europe. I'd say, we got some benefit in the first half from North America, but probably that's moderated a little bit as we're looking to the second half, particularly on-road in North America. So net-net, and obviously South America has been a tailwind as well for us, Colin. So, 12% of our business, and it's certainly contributed to the growth based on the recoveries. So if that helps you a little bit and if you need a bit more from a product perspective, it's predominantly a turbo business, our emissions business and our thermal business are the products that are driving that growth for us.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. I'd like to just sneak one more in. Can you just provide \u2013 on the Sevcon acquisition, can you describe a little bit of what the powertrain electronic capabilities are that you're acquiring there in terms of what \u2013 a little more specific on actually what the product is that you're delivering and whether that acquisition is really more about cross-selling that with the rest of the business or is it about the backlog you're acquiring?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. So, I mean, fundamentally what we're really getting with Sevcon is, we're getting tremendous design and development capability from their engineering organization. They can absolutely understand the electronics aspects of the system works. And that just coupled with BorgWarner's existing capability really accelerates it. But it's not just an engineering play, Colin, they got revenue, they run about $50 million of revenue, and they ship a lot of invertors and converter-type products. They also have some battery charging technology that they ship out. So, it's basically buying a lot of very strong engineering capability coupled with an existing revenue platform that is accelerating as they take that capability, add that to our capability, and we can offer a complete system solution to the light vehicle customers as well as the commercial vehicle customers.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much for the color.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you, Colin.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.","Elad Hillman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. This is Elad Hillman on behalf of Ryan Brinkman.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Good morning.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Good morning.","Elad Hillman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. Can you just comment on the margin progression at Wahler? Now that the outlook for commercial vehicle production seems to be improving, can you get any progress there?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","I'm sorry. Can you repeat the question? I didn't hear the beginning of the question.","Elad Hillman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Sorry. So, just wondering about the progression on the margins for the Wahler transaction, now that the outlook for commercial vehicle seems to be better?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Hey, yeah, Wahler, okay. That business we acquired several years ago. And if you go back in time, it was low single-digit. And our expectations were to get that to migrate into high single-digit and hopefully ultimately get into double-digit. I would say, we're behind that schedule for numerous reasons. In particular, we had a lot of product moves that we anticipate of doing from one of our facilities that we had to slowdown. And as a result to that, we haven't been able to get to profitability where it needs to be.","If we deal deeper into it, that acquisition was about valves, the valves and rivet business for us and valve market share that we have in Europe. But I would say, the operational performance at this point is somewhat of a headwind it has been for the last couple years it is this year, and we need to fix that going forward. So, as we go forward, I was saying earlier on the call that would be maybe one of the little tailwinds that we can get going forward, and we're working on it very hard.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","And, just on \u2013 sorry, just to add on to Ron's comments, which was a great summary. The broader question you asked him in terms of commercial vehicle overall from a BorgWarner perspective both growth and operating margin performance, we're very happy with our commercial vehicle business, it's contributing well to our performance. But, Ron's right, we've got an isolated issue within the ex-Wahler business that we need to fix, and we will.","Elad Hillman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Wanted to talk a little bit about the backlog. As mentioned earlier that it's coming ahead of the original guide, certainly understand some of the back half conservatism. But as we roll forward to next year, you guided 460 to 670 \u2013 was the conservatism and risk adjustment around potential launch delays that you baked into the regional backlog? Is some of that now dissipating and that number could wind up being higher? Just another way of putting it, which you probably won't answer is, what sort of a gross backlog and then the discount for delay launches you've applied this year and how is it shaping up for next year?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. Brian, I'm going to take a shot at it, and then if Ron wants to jump in, we'll let him. Let me start with a couple of points to backlog. First of all, I'm thrilled with the first half of the year, first of all. It's exceeded our expectation a little bit. It's been a terrific first half of the year. The second half is moderated. It's basically the same as what it was from the prior guide. We've not really changed too much on the second half guide.","Ron articulated some of the headwinds that we're going to pay attention to as we go into that. And all of that rose up to this strong 7% midpoint organic growth for the year, and you can see the full year backlog number. You're right, it's a little too early to give you 2018 numbers. We will talk at the Investor Day a little bit on how we've seen our growth rates looking out over the next two years, three years, five years. So that will probably give you a little bit more of a sense. But we're going through our process, Brian, as we get ready for 2018, but certainly there's nothing to be fearful of in terms of what we gave you last year, that's for sure, because we're executing very well against that target this year. So, I don't know whether that helps you enough, but that's how I'm thinking about the backlog.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","So, Brian, I will add a few things. As you know, we changed our process a couple of years ago. And what we do is, we'll take a look at the gross backlog number and we will make subjective adjustments. And given markets and given products and given customers to those numbers like we did this year and last year, and that process has done very well for us, and we'll continue doing that process into the next year backlog as well.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And can we look at the backlog and say, most of the growth we saw first half was due to just the risk factors not being needed or were there launches that were upsized or bigger magnitude than perhaps you originally...","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","I would say, Brian, it was launch cadence and volume. That's where the uplift \u2013 or the outperformance, so to speak, has been in the first half, less macro, if that makes sense to you.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","So, the number of launches is the same. I would just say, it's a combination of summer coming in a little earlier or kicked in a little better or some of the volume assumptions that we've loaded in have run a little bit better, which I think, to back to Ron's point, Brian, kind of points to how we wanted to do it going into the year. And I think it's prudent, and it's paying off actually.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. I've got more strategic questions, but I'll save them for a couple of weeks.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Okay. Look forward to that, Brian.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore ISI.","Chris McNally - Evercore ISI","Morning, guys.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Good morning.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Good morning.","Chris McNally - Evercore ISI","Maybe just a little bit on market share in electrification, particularly 48-volt and plug-in. Do you have a better sense, it's been about a year that you've been taking strong orders for 48-volt or actually a little bit more, but a sense for what market share could be in the core product like eBooster, you didn't really exclusively give guides on the last Analyst Day, but you can kind of back into the numbers that it seem like a number between 15% and 25%. And it just seems like you may have some more market intelligence now that 48-volt seems to be gaining some momentum?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. Chris, this is James. Let me give some answers there. First and foremost, just to be open \u2013 we'll share quite a bit more detail on the some \u2013 hard numbers, so to speak, as we go into Analyst Day in a couple of weeks. But what I would say you directionally is, the activity level around hybrid and electric has both increased pretty significantly from a year ago, and our activity certainly increased pretty significantly across hybrid platforms and electric platforms. I think your intuition is right, on the 48-volt model, hybrid is becoming a very strong platform for growth, as is plug-in hybrids, I think those are the two that are really accelerated in the last year.","What I can share with you from a BorgWarner point of view, we feel very, very good about the win rates we're experiencing around that technology. So, again, we'll share you more detail in a week or two. Your point on market share as well, Chris, is right on. We \u2013 in a conventional combustion business, we generally have a market share in the low-20%s is a good reference point.","And the way we've modeled our business in terms of communicating outlooks, we've modeled a little bit of a lower market share assumption in the 15% to 20% range for hybrids and electrics, because it's a little bit of a newer space. And we want to give our self a chance to see how that will play out. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of a sense, Chris, of what's going on. And again really looking forward to sharing much more detail on that with you in a couple of weeks.","Chris McNally - Evercore ISI","That's fantastic. And just one quick follow-on in terms of \u2013 again, just from a qualitative standpoint. I mean the market tends to get very worried about these new businesses, whether they're going to be more competitive in terms of the more traditional powertrain. Even though a lot of the players are the same, is it fair to say that expectations from kind of a \u2013 whether it's a pricing on a margin standpoint from a BorgWarner, when you look at your backlog, it's tracking as you thought and these continue to be, I think, as you indicated at the Analyst Day sort of corporate average-type margin businesses?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah, absolutely is the quick answer, Chris. And I'll give you two data points. One is, the business that we're quoting and winning on hybrid and electric type applications are absolutely meeting the BorgWarner typical threshold of 15% after-tax ROIC in their corporate margins. So we're very comfortable there.","But I think more important \u2013 or as importantly from a year ago, a lot of those products we talked to you about last year are now in production. So we can actually see real life data, if you wish of how they're running down the production lines, and the operating margins are coming in right where we'd expected them to. So no dilution of margin performance as we go forward with new products on hybrids and electrics.","Chris McNally - Evercore ISI","That's fantastic. Thanks so much, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Kelley with Jefferies.","David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Just a quick follow-up to that \u2013 yeah, a quick follow-up to that 48-volt question prior here. Maybe could you give us some color on the eBooster system content per vehicle opportunity in your minds? And maybe how that might compare to your traditional turbocharger content in gas and diesel?","And also just on the earlier Sevcon discussion, how do we think about the incremental add to your addressable hybrid content opportunity, now that you're adding Sevcon into the fold here?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. David, let me quickly mention the Sevcon piece first. I think, fundamentally what it's doing is, we already have a good basis of power electronics and electronics and software capability in the company. This is basically scaling us up and adding to that, which is super important. But in addition to that, it's actually given us some hard products basically. They already build and ship inverters and those types of products. So we'll get that. And they've obviously got some existing customer relationships. So that's the real power.","But the real power is going to be when BorgWarner and Sevcon as a united group walk into the customers and can talk and offer a complete integrated system.","Just to give you an example, take a P2 Hybrid as an example. We'll be able to take BorgWarner's clutching technology, we'll be able to take the former Remy motor technology, and then the third element to that system is the power electronics. And that's the piece that Sevcon will bring to the table.","So that's going to be a very, very powerful story. It's a little early to know how that \u2013 what that's going to look like. But we'll get clarity around that. But from a strategic fit, it's a super thing for us.","eBooster is still in the early phase of adoption, but we're seeing tremendous interest from a lot of customers. Typical rough number for an eBooster is about couple hundred bucks, but don't forget you're adding that is plus the turbo, not just on its own. So a conventional turbo, I think couple hundred bucks, turbo plus and eBooster, $400.","So we're seeing a lot of interest, David. We see a lot of growth in there. And most important, from a BorgWarner perspective, we absolutely believe we're the leader in eBoosting technology. So, yeah, a lot of excitement around both of those, David.","David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC","All right. Perfect. Appreciate the color. Thanks, guys.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Richard Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Hey, Rich.","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Hey, Rich.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey. Just I want to follow-up on the Sevcon. So in terms of power electronics, does this satisfy your need for scale with that acquisition once it closes? Or are there other opportunities, other areas within power electronics you would look to add?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah, Rich. I think obviously we want to get a closer look once we've got the deal done and all of that good stuff. It's additive. I don't think we stop there. I don't think we stop there either organically or through acquisition.","This certainly helps us, but I would love more, both organically and acquisition. It's just going to be a function of focus on integrating Sevcon first, keep looking for other opportunities and other targets and add them. So we're going to scale up even beyond Sevcon in power electronics and electronics for sure, both organically and acquisition.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks, James. And then just two quick housekeeping, Ron. The increase in CapEx, I might have missed that, but what is that related to? And then, just thoughts on steel prices. There has been a lot of discussion around Harris (56:30), et cetera, rising prices, some headwinds in some other areas of the economy, other industrials. What are your thoughts on price there within steel?","Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.","Right. So, first the CapEx. As you know, our backlog is \u2013 really came in strong in the first half. And some of that backlog is the DCT plant in China. So what we're doing is, we're going to put in some more capacity to continue those ramp ups from our customer there, so that's the DCT. And a little bit more in the four-wheel drive area.","On commodity prices, we came into the year anticipating inflationary environment. We saw some of it. Our operating folks did a very good job passing that up through to our customers on pass-throughs. The question around what is going to happen on steel prices once the administration makes a decision on tariffs and imports and all that, I think whatever happens there, just say that they do go forward and put something in place to benefit the U.S. producers. Again, that would flow through our normal process of pass-throughs and contract negotiations we have with our customer, Rich. So, yeah, that would be for the industry itself a headwind, but I think for BorgWarner itself, we could navigate through that.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you, Rich.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Stover with Susquehanna.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Matt, good morning.","Matthew Stover - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Most have been asked, but two things. One, could you just kind of bucket all the factors that favorably \u2013 that impacted the Drivetrain comp year-to-year? I know you mentioned in a bunch different places, but I just want to make sure my head is straight on that. And then, I wanted to ask you something about pricing after that?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Okay. We have no problem. So, from a Drivetrain perspective, what's been pushing the growth, it's primarily coming from the backlog, so it's launching of a lot of new products. We've certainly gained a little bit, as I mentioned early, with the truck mix in North America helping our transfer case business. Our DCT ramp is certainly accelerated, which has been good. We've seen all-wheel drive growth hovering in Korea as well. So it's kind of a combination of all of the above if that helps you, Matt. Those are the big drivers up.","Matthew Stover - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. And the second thing is on pricing. Going into the quarter, one of your German peers had talked about industry pricing and it kind of provoked a question. I'm wondering if it's rising commodity prices, falling volumes you're seeing OEMs push back harder or push harder on price or is it more just a case of the dog ate their homework?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","I would articulate it this way, Matt. The pricing environment is tough, it's always tough, and we know how to operating in that environment. I wouldn't say it's got any incrementally tougher than it was last year or the year before. The good news from a board perspective is, we got a great discipline in place around cost reduction to offset a lot of that price pressure. But we're not calling out or seeing any shift in the pricing environment at this stage for sure.","Matthew Stover - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Thanks very much.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Thank you, Matt.","Operator","We have time for one final question, and that question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Guggenheim.","Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities","Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Good morning, Emmanuel.","Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities","So, wanted to get your take on a couple of developments that could sort of impact the industry. The first one is sort of noise from the new administration that they could sort of freeze the standards at the 2021 level, and I wanted to know, in your opinion, is that a good, bad or neutral thing?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Emmanuel, from a BorgWarner point of view, you're asking or...?","Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities","Yeah.","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. I think, our view, Emmanuel, is that the standards are going to continue to climb. There is a good chance, so there could be some moderation at the standard a flattening out, so to speak, of the line in the outyears. And our strategy that we put in place two years to three years ago have been well balanced between combustion, hybrid and electric.","We're kind of okay either way frankly, because all that happens with acceleration of more aggressive standards. You just shift the mix between hybrid, electric and combustion. And when we've got content per vehicle growth in all three, we're in a good place either way. So, I would say, neutral to slightly positive is our view, if that helps you on that one.","Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities","Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess, the second thing seems be sort of like a lot of movement in sort of the assets that are around in the combustion engine area. We see Delphi is spinning off their Powertrain business. They were seeing some noises from some of the German competitors that are they're flexible or looking at sort of options. Do you expect some sort of consolidation of the combustion engine powertrain competitive landscape or do you think that the deals going forward will be mostly limited to electrical exposure?","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","Yeah. That's a good thought, Emmanuel. I'll give you my take on it. I read the same stuff you do, and I can see the action some people are taking. I'll only tell you this. I just love our propulsion business. I love the growth that we have now. And when I look at the outlook for us from a \u2013 with that portfolio and what we're adding to with Sevcon and others to come, I love it. I mean, we're going to grow mid to high single-digit organic growth. That's going to flow-through to EPS and we're in a really, really good spot. So, I can't speculate and speak for others. I can only tell you I love our business.","Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities","And I guess, within BorgWarner, would you have appetite for additional \u2013 acquiring additional combustion engine powertrain revenues or will your deals be mostly focused on the...","James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.","I would say, yeah \u2013 Emmanuel, I would say, our bias is primarily adding technology around electronics. It might be software, it might be power electronics, and accelerating on the on the hybrid and electric vehicle type technology. You never say never to a combustion asset, you always look at those. But our focus is adding and continuing to build system capability, so we can offer complete solution for all types of propulsion vehicles. And I feel really good about how that's working out for us so far.","Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities","Great. Thanks for the color.","James R.

You will find the link to this document at the Events & Presentation section beneath the notice for this conference call. We encourage you to follow along with these charts during Ron's discussion of our results.","With that, I'll turn it over to James.","James Verrier","Thank you, Ken, and good day, everybody. Ron and I are very pleased to review both third quarter results today, as well as some of our recent accomplishments. Let me just take a moment before I begin to thank all of the BorgWarner employees around the world for another good quarter.","Now onto our results; so during the third quarter reported sales were just under $1.9 billion, now that's down 7% from a year ago but up 3% when we exclude the impact of foreign currencies. The U.S. GAAP earnings were $0.70 per share or $0.73 per share when we exclude non-recurring charges. Our operating income margin again excluding non-recurring charges was an impressive 13.3% in the quarter. So considering a lower than normal growth quarter, some of the restructuring inefficiencies and the new plants and plant expansions that we are managing this year, we view this as very good performance by our operations.","Let me talk about the two segments. First of all, the Engine segment; so third quarter sales in the Engine segment were about $1.3 billion, that's down 7% from a year ago and when we exclude the impact of foreign currencies the segment grew at 4%. These results were primarily led by strong light-vehicle turbo sales particularly in Europe, partially offset by weaker market conditions in China and some weaker market conditions in commercial vehicles around the world.","Now the Drivetrain segment, sales were $584 million, that's down 7% from a year ago or up 2% when we exclude foreign currencies. These results were primarily led by resurgent all-wheel-drive sales growth in North America and this was partially offset by the weaker market conditions in China. The major North American program ramp that had slowed Drivetrain sales growth over the previous four quarters did return to material volumes in the third quarter. We believe this program combined with benefits from the European restructuring will drive solid growth in margin expansion in Drivetrain in 2016.","Our financial strength and strong performance is based on our ability to anticipate and drive the next technology ways. So as we look to the future BorgWarner continues to invest for the long term. Capital spending continues to grow. We spent about 7.3% of sales on capital in the third quarter which is above our long-term target of 5% to 6%. Typically our capital spending is primarily for machinery and equipment. However, our growth over the next several years does require investment in new plants and plant expansions which is driving some elevated spending in the near term. We do expect this to continue through the end of this year, after which we will return to normal spending levels. Our investment in R&D was 4% of sales in the quarter which is right in line with our target for the year and the intensity around organic integration and product development remains very strong.","I am also proud to share some of the exciting announcements we made during the last few months. First of all, BorgWarner produces the 2-speed Torque-On-Demand transfer cases for the recently launched Foton Motor\u2019s Sauvana SUV. BorgWarner's Torque-On-Demand technology automatically redistributes the torque from the rear wheels to the front wheels without driver intervention for both improved traction, increased stability and enhanced dynamics. BorgWarner also received a 2014 World Excellence Award in the Aligned Business Framework category for exemplifying the Ford Motor Company\u2019s principles of quality, value and innovation. BorgWarner supplies silent engine timing chains for a wide variety of Yamaha vehicles. These include motorcycles, snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles, recreational off-highway and personal watercrafts.","Also BorgWarner supplies Eco-Launch stop\/start accumulator technology and friction plates for the new 8-speed rear-wheel drive automatic transmission from General Motors. To enable the transmission\u2019s stop\/start functionality, BorgWarner\u2019s system enables the transmission\u2019s stop\/start functionality providing rapid and smooth engagements during engine restarts. This new transmission will improve fuel economy up to 5% compared with similar 6-speed automatic transmissions and it will debut on the 2016 Cadillac CT6 and will also drive the 2016 Cadillac CTS and ATS.","BorgWarner produces its mini direct-acting variable force solenoid for the 2016 Chevy Volt, Chevy Malibu hybrid and Cadillac ELR. Designed to deliver increased accuracy with significantly lower leakage, the advanced solenoid reduces parasitic losses from the transmission oil pump, which saves battery power to propel the vehicle.","Now let me move on and share a little bit of an overview on our updated guidance for 2015. We have narrowed our sales growth guidance range to the low end of the previous range. Our reported sales growth is now expected to be between minus 6% at the low end and minus 5% at the high end. This is compared with minus 5.5% to minus 2.5% previously. The change in our sales growth guidance is primarily related to two things. The impact of weaker than expected market conditions in China on our business and weak commercial vehicle markets around the world. Now when we exclude the impact of currency, our growth is expected to be approximately 4.5%. We also note our earnings guidance range. We now expect earnings to be within a range of $2.95 to $3 per diluted share and this compares with the $2.95 to $3.10 per diluted share previously. Our operating margin is expected -- still expected to be approximately 13%. Now Ron will provide a lot more details about our updated guidance shortly.","So I am encouraged by our year-to-date performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year. Despite some challenging market conditions our full year guidance implies mid-single-digit growth and outstanding operating performance in 2015. And the restructuring and expansions activities, when they are through we have a clear transition to continue the strong performance in 2016 and beyond. So as you look ahead the industry's continued adoption of our leading edge Powertrain technology combined with operational excellence are the primary reasons that we have been, we still are and we will continue to be the leading order of supplier in terms of growth and operating performance.","Now with that let me turn the call over to Ron.","Ron Hundzinski","Thank you, James, and good day, everyone. Before I begin reviewing the financials, I also would like to commend all of our employees for their hard work in the quarter. Also as Ken mentioned I will be referring to supplemental financials slide deck and it is posted on our IR website. I do encourage you to follow along.","Now, on to our financials. James already provided a detailed review our sales performance in the quarter. In summary as shown on Slide 2 of the slide deck, sales were down 7% from a year ago or 3% excluding the impact of foreign currencies. Working down the income statement, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 21.1% in the quarter or up 20 basis points from last year. During the same period SG&A as a percentage of sales was 7.9%, a 70 basis point improvement from a year ago. R&D spending, which is included in SG&A was 4%. You may have noticed that SG&A is nearly down $27 million year-over-year. Over half of this is related to currency. Of the remaining amount, corporate expenses were down $5 million and our [indiscernible] were down about $9 million.","Operating income in the quarter was $237 million, excluding $9 million of restructuring charges and $4 million of M&A expenses related to the Remy transaction, operating income was $250 million or 13.3% of sales, up 80 basis points from a year ago as shown on Slide 3 of the slide deck. Excluding nonrecurring charges previously discussed, as well as the impact of foreign currencies, operating income was up $22 million on $66 million higher sales, giving us an incremental margin of 35%.","As you look further down the income statement, equity and affiliate earnings was about $9 million in the quarter, down from $15 million last year. This line item represents the performance of NSK-Warner our 50\/50 joint venture in Japan, which sell transmission components to our Japanese customers in Japan and China, as well as TEL, our turbocharger joint venture in India. Lower NSK-Warner sales in Japan and China was the primary reason for the decline in affiliate earnings.","Interest expense and finance charges were $15 million in the quarter up from $9 million a year ago. The increase is primarily due to the $1 billion of fixed rate senior notes issued in the first quarter of 2015. Provision for income taxes in the quarter on a reported basis was $67 million. However, this included favorable tax adjustments of $6 million. You can read about each one of these adjustments in our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. Excluding, the adjustments the provision for income taxes was $73 million, which is an effective tax rate of 29.5% in the quarter. Our year-to-date effective tax rate is 29.5%, which is also our estimate for the full year.","Net earnings attributable to non-controlling interest were about $9 million in the quarter up slightly from $6 million the third quarter of 2014. This line item reflects our minority partner's share in the earnings performance of our Korean and Chinese consolidated joint ventures. That brings us back to net earnings, which were $150 million in the quarter. Net earnings excluding nonrecurring items were $165 million or $0.73 per share.","Now let's take a closer look at our operating units' segments in the quarter; beginning on Slide 4 of the slide deck. As James said earlier reported Engine segment net sales were about $1.3 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the Engine segment excluding currency was 4% compared to same period a year ago. Turning to Slide 5, adjusted EBIT was $212 million for the Engine segment or 16.2% of sales. Despite inefficiencies related to investments in new plant construction and expansion and the Wahler restructuring, both of which are, for our emissions product family adjusted EBIT as a percentage of sales was up 40 basis points from a year ago.","Excluding currency, the Engine segment's adjusted EBIT was up $10 million on $55 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 17%. A very good performance given the level of investment activity within the segment. Plant construction and expansion currently in progress should be largely behind us by the end of 2015 and the restructuring plan for Wahler is on target after which we expect it to be a double-digit margin business.","Now turning to Slide 6, Drivetrain segment net sales were $584 million in the quarter. Excluding currency, sales increased about 2% compared with the same period a year ago. On Slide 7, adjusted EBIT was $70 million for the Drivetrain segment or 12% of sales. Despite inefficiencies related to investments in the new DCT plant in China and restructuring plant in Europe, adjusted EBIT as a percentage of sales was up 120 basis points from a year ago. Excluding currency, the Drivetrain segment adjusted EBIT was up over $8 million on $10 million in higher sales for an incremental margin of nearly 90%.","If you recall the third quarter of 2014 we had about $3 million of headwinds related to restructuring inefficiencies. We are beginning to see those headwinds dissipate as we get closer to completing the restructuring. This benefit is reflected in the higher incremental margin in this segment for the quarter. Drivetrain's European restructuring plant is on target and expected to be completed by the end of 2015. The ramp up of the new DCT plant in China which was expected to begin in early 2015 is under review considering the weaker than expected market conditions in China. The segment review highlights good progress on our restructuring and expansion plans, which will strengthen our competitive position and performance over the long-term.","Now let's take a look at our balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $470 million of net cash from operating activities in the first nine months of 2015 down $76 million from $546 million a year ago. Weaker foreign currencies, higher cash outlays for restructuring and a few other miscellaneous items reduced net cash from operating activities in the first nine months of 2015 as compared with the same period a year ago. Capital spending was $419 million in the first nine months of 2015. This is up $21 million from a year ago. The increase was driven by capital required to support our backlog of net new business. Free cash flow, which we define as net cash from operating activities less capital spending was $51 million in the first nine months of 2015 down from $148 million in the first nine months of 2014. We expect to generate between $200 million and $250 million of free cash flow in 2015.","Investments in restructuring and expansion that are driving elevated spending will soon be behind us. We expect spending to normalize beginning next year. Also our realignment plan which will provide increased treasury management flexibility will be complete. As a result we expect to see an increase in cash available for corporate initiatives beginning in 2016. We will quantify this improvement and clarify our intentions in our 2016 guidance call in January.","Looking at the balance sheet itself; balance sheet debt increased by $469 million at the end of the third quarter in 2015 compared with the end of 2014. Cash increased by $236 million during the same period. The $233 million increase in net debt was primarily due to capital expenditures, dividend payments to shareholders and share repurchases. Our net debt to net capital ratio of 17% at the end of third quarter is up from 12.8% at the end of 2014. Net debt to EBITDA at the end of the year on a trailing 12 month basis is 0.6 times.","Now I would like to discuss our updated guidance for 2015. James reviewed our guidance at a high-level, I will just discuss some of the finer points. We have narrowed our sales guidance to the low end of the previous range of minus 6% to minus 5% compared with the minus 5.5% to minus 2.5% previously. James described the weaker than expected market conditions that affected the change. Our business in China was the primary contributor. According to third-party sources light vehicle production in China was down 4% in the quarter. During that same period volumes at our four largest customers were down 12% in aggregate. And our sales growth in China for the quarter was flat. We expect our business in China to modestly improve to mid-single-digit growth in the fourth quarter.","Our full year dollar-to-euro exchange rate assumption is $1.12, slightly higher than the previous assumed rate of $1.10. We have also narrowed our expected EPS within a range of $2.95 to $3 per share. The change in EPS guidance is primarily due to the impact of lower expected growth sales. Our share repurchase activity is gaining momentum. We spent $67 million on share repurchases in the third quarter and $130 million year-to-date. We still expect to spend $1 billion on share repurchases during the three-year period ending the first quarter of 2018. Our weighted average diluted share count is still expected to be approximately 226 million shares for 2015.","Our operating income margin guidance is unchanged at approximately 13%. This implies a mid-teens incremental margin for the full year, incremental margins north of 20% in the fourth quarter. We continue to be confident in our ability to execute in any market. This company has demonstrated a heightened focus on efficiency and cost. This focus resulted in highly efficient growth and record margins in each of the last four years. With our solid growth and operations performing at a very high level 2015 should be another great year for BorgWarner. As we look beyond 2015 we intend to execute our growth plan yielding solid growth and to efficiently convert our sales growth to profits. The future is bright for BorgWarner.","So with that I'd like to turn the call back over to Ken.","Ken Lamb","Thanks, Ron. We are going to now move to the Q&A portion of the call. Melissa, please remind everyone of the Q&A procedure.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Rich Kwas","Hi, good morning everyone. On Drivetrain Ron you talked about comping against some of the inefficiencies from last year but this is a pretty big step up in the margin. So it would seem like going forward here less than inefficiencies, leverage in some of your key platforms and there's an upward trajectory from here, is that the right way to think about it versus the 12% you have [trended] this quarter?","Ron Hundzinski","Rich, I will say at this point it was a really good quarter, but the overall intent is for upward trajectory on margins in that segment, right. First thing I would note is that we did get a little bit favorability from North America F1 50 obviously because the volumes have returned, that also is driving some of the upper movement in that segment.","Rich Kwas","Okay. Then just a broader question, I know you are not going to give the backlog until January and give your 2016 views then, but how should we think about growth for the company as in the current environment, assuming that the China production outlook is relatively modest next year and the developed markets are relatively modest as well? Just trying to get an understanding of where you think growth can go over the course for the next 12 months considering the landscape and considering what's happened with some of your key customers within the backlog that you provided last year at this time?","James Verrier","Rich, this is James. Maybe what I will do is take a shot if I can and just giving you a little bit of high level commentary and then I want to ask Ken to talk maybe a little bit more specifically about maybe some of the math about how to think about the details of the backlog if that works for you. So I think, as we kind of transition through this year first of all and we are looking to pinpoint mid-single-digit type of growth which clearly is pretty decent. The two headwinds that we really faced from a macro point as we have gone through the year are commercial vehicle and China. China being obviously the bigger piece of that. So those are the two kind of headwinds that we have kind of have faced this year.","I think it's fair to say as you look at commercial vehicle going into next year we are not looking for meaningful improvement in those end markets. I think in China what we are looking for from a light vehicle perspective as we look to next year in China, Rich, is 3% to 5% type growth rate of the market in China. As you know our content will grow well above that market rate in China because of the adoption of our technology. So we are looking for a strong growth here in China next year and that coupled with other elements of our backlog we are looking for a good growth here next year. But I am going to ask Ken to just put a little bit more detailed commentary around that so he can help you from a math point, Rich.","Ken Lamb","Thanks, James. This is Ken. Based on the preamble of your question you are not expecting a lot I think. But we want to be as transparent as we can be about where we think we are throughout next year. So let's talk about the math a little bit. So rough math, this year's backlog is coming in at about 55% of what we expected coming into the year. Now with the conditions that caused that lower growth persist into next year and you know the conditions I am referring to is our business in China and commercial vehicles. Then we can reasonably assume that the backlog will come down similar levels next year. So essentially what we are saying is that's about cutting it in half.","Then once you layer on the potential impact of other macro risk factors, it's reasonable to expect that we are looking at low-to-mid single-digit growth next year. Now regarding these other macro factors, if you look at the last five years we have had recessions, natural disasters, debt crisis, currency devaluations, business disruptions at some of our largest customers, just to name a few. The magnitude of the impact of these factors has varied for us but they all have had an impact. We intend to do a better job accounting for these risks in our guidance going forward. Did that answer your question.","Rich Kwas","Yes. So I mean basically 55% of $1.1 billion that you provided last year at this time and then what are the -- what's the other color around the macro factors that you are saying will be down?","Ken Lamb","Well I don\u2019t know that we have any data -- numeric data to attach to that. We just want you to know that that's something that we are definitely going to be considering as we come through with guidance next year.","Rich Kwas","Okay. So that would be developed markets and other things that are going on basically.","Ken Lamb","Yes. Sure.","Rich Kwas","Okay. I will pass it on. Thanks.","James Verrier","Thanks, Rich.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is open.","John Murphy","Good morning guys. I could just follow-on just on that top line thought process. Is there any change in your view of the revenue generation that Remy will bring in next year? And if you could remind us roughly what you would expect that to be for '16?","James Verrier","Yes. John this is James here. It was about $1.2 billion is the approximate revenue stream that we were expecting to generate from Remy. Obviously we are going through the [close pressure] so we are going through some additional validations and we will bring a more accurate number of course for the meeting in January. But we are not expecting a meaningful shift away from that $1.2 billion number, is a good way to think of it John.","John Murphy","So if we layer that onto your base business this year and you had say sort of 5% to 6%, I am sorry -- low-to-mid single-digit growth is what you said, Ken is sort of the combination of those two would be a decent way to think about it?","Ken Lamb","I think that's right. So the low-to-mid single digit growth was on the base business and then later on Remy on top of that.","John Murphy","All right. Just want to make sure we are clear on that. Second question, Ron, you talked about some delays or sort of some real stalls here in this DCT launch in China, yet you are getting up the F150 really ramping up pretty hardcore here and you are getting the restructuring in Eastern Europe working fairly well and should be running full throttle as far as benefits in '16. Is there any reason to think the Drivetrain should have a margin not above 12% next year, just given all those big guys? But is China really going to derail this or is that something then won't be that bad?","Ron Hundzinski","So these negative there, I agree that it should be above 12%, John. The DCT plant is a Western OEM and at this point of all the headwinds we have had in DCT in China that's really basically the last one left, I would just say it that way. But we will give more color on that impact as I said in my script and will actually articulate exactly that headwind that we might see next year. But the bottom line is that the margin going forward should be known for that 12%.","John Murphy","Okay. That's helpful. And then just lastly, if you think about capital and free cash flow, looks like there was a down tick in your free cash flow guidance to the $250 million, I think it previously $250 million to $300 million. What's the key driver of that? And as you think of maybe that might in the same context of the share repos, why don\u2019t you think you would be more aggressive with share repos just given what's happened with the stock more recently?","Ron Hundzinski","Well, again, this movement in free cash flow, the combination of a little bit in earnings and a little bit items on the balance sheet movement. But to get back to the more important question right now we surely intend to be more aggressive. If you look at the year-to-date number it's not a well represented number because we had a self-imposed blackout period during the Remy acquisition. Our intent quite frankly is to be more aggressive given where the stock price is, I can just say that John.","John Murphy","Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.","James Verrier","Thanks, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Chris McNally","Good morning, guys. I just wanted to -- its very helpful, appreciate the color on the '16 backlog. I think everyone was just trying to triangulate those numbers. But as we look at the 55% number, I mean you have given detail in the past about roughly 40% of your backlog coming from Asia. And then obviously the commercial vehicles are weak on top of that. I mean to get to the 55% could you just talk about how much of the backlog is pushed out from '15 to '16 to later years because of lower volumes related to the Chinese market? Because the math would suggest you are losing almost 100% of the Asian backlog. And so, if you could just give some color about potentially what's lost versus what was pushed out by year or two even -- from '15-'16 into '16-'17? Thank you.","Ken Lamb","So the way I want to frame this is we provided that sort of directional guidance to help you think about where things may land. As far as the split of backlog, how much is going to be Asia, how much is Europe-North America, how much of its push out and how much of it is just program cuts, you got to give us a little bit of time to work through that. I think as we sit here today Asia as a percentage of the backlog is coming down. That's the market where we are having the most impact from what's going in the world today. In commercial vehicle the percentage of the backlog is also very likely coming down. Let us hold through that, what we wanted was to people to have a good sense for where we think we're headed next year. We will give more details in January.","Chris McNally","Okay. Maybe just quantitatively if we take out China and CV would the backlog numbers for all other global production would they have come down as well and so that we are essentially near the $1.1 billion number that we were referencing probably would have been lower regardless other than a weak China and a weak commercial vehicle?","Ken Lamb","Well. Sure. If you want to kind of recap the year and the things that affected the backlog we talked about primarily China, our mix of business in China. We have talked about the commercial vehicle issues around the world. We had some issues with the Asia launches that were coming down last year. We had some mix issues in North America as well. As I kind of go over those four or five topics, the two persistent ones is the impact of China and commercial vehicles. The mix issue in North America, we think that's going to normalize with the F150 coming back on screen for us. And the Asia launches that's all linked to China. China kind of drives that whole market anyway. So let us continue to do some work on that. But I think you are speaking about it correctly. We just have to work through the numbers for you.","Chris McNally","Okay. Thanks, Ken. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Leiker with Baird. Your line is open.","David Leiker","Good morning everyone. I am going to take one last stab at this comment about the backlog. How much of the short fall that you are seeing from the backlog that's realized this year is coming from currency? I think when you did the backlog last year you had enough pretty high euro value in there.","Ken Lamb","I think we are $1.20 [texture]. But the European portion of the backlog was pretty small. It was remember coming into the year we thought it was going to be what 15% of the backlog. So the euro while it came down significantly, it didn\u2019t move the backlog number.","David Leiker","Appreciate the increased transparency with everything, the slides and the commentary so far. I want to see if I can go one step further. Can you give us some quantitative ideally but qualitative perspective in terms of the revenue performance by region in the quarter?","Ron Hundzinski","I gave you some David. I told you basically in China we were flat, that was in the script.","David Leiker","Right. In the down market.","Ron Hundzinski","In a down market and actually the comparable was to our customers in that market was down 12 and we were flat even though the market was four.","David Leiker","About Europe and North America.","James Verrier","We are just looking at the data.","Ron Hundzinski","Because remember we had modest growth in both of those regions in the light vehicle area. Both North America and Europe we did grow modestly, and obviously in commercial vehicles not much growth at all.","David Leiker","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Brett Hoselton","Good morning gentlemen. Two questions here. First on 2015 margins lower sales guidance but you maintained your margin guidance. Kind of what are the offsets there? Normally you would expect a little downward leverage there?","Ron Hundzinski","On just really good operational performance. I mean we had a good third quarter. As you can see we are anticipating that to continue that performance level. So that we didn't feel that we need to take down the margin when the sales came down that we could still hold the margin. And it's probably through just good operations performance that's what's going on there Brett.","Brett Hoselton","Then as you think about 2016 margins, I know you are not going to provide guidance here. But can you kind of talk about some of the major puts and takes there, pluses or minuses that you see.","James Verrier","So we have been very clear about our objective is to get mid-teens incremental. So if you take sales and assign mid teens incremental that's the starting point. Now so some of the items that are going to be a tailwind for us, these inefficiencies we would see in for three quarters this year and we said that those inefficiencies will be tailwinds for us. So you take the mid-teens incrementals and then add in the inefficiencies that will now be headwinds and they will be on top of it. So the end result would be higher than mid-teens incremental margins going into next year.","Brett Hoselton","And these inefficiencies can you just remind me what they were -- not necessarily what they were but how much they were?","Ron Hundzinski","Sure. So remember in the second quarter we were seeing -- while first and second quarter and actually last year we're seeing anywhere from about $3 million I think the high was what $7 million, $8 million in the third quarter headwinds and it was bouncing around some time to be $4 million or $5 million. I think the worst stretch was that second quarter around $7 million of headwinds. It's somewhere between this $3 million to $7 million. The first time we saw it was a year ago in the third and was at $3 million, I referred in my script. So it's been between that number $3 million to $7 million. Now I am not seeing all that dissipate all 7 or 5 whatever number you use but the majority of that will. Some of it's normal activity that we have always things going on but majority is going to dissipate as we go into next year.","Ken Lamb","Minor correction, $9 million.","Ron Hundzinski","What was it $9 million in the second quarter?","Ken Lamb","Yes.","Brett Hoselton","$3 million in the first and kind of $9 million-ish in the second something along those lines.","Ron Hundzinski","That $9 million was what we have -- first I think $9 million is the worst we are going to see quite frankly and that was in the second quarter. So it was bouncing between actually probably $5 million to $7 million was really the average, $9 million was the high end. Now again you can't just take simple $6 million to $7 million take that off the table, but some good portion of that will off the table.","Brett Hoselton","Yes. Was there an impact in the third quarter specifically?","Ron Hundzinski","No impact. That's well the year-over-year difference was favorable, right, that's what drove the high 120 basis points of improvement in the Drivetrain segment because we didn\u2019t have that headwind. So it is a good example of what we are trying to talk about here and why the incremental was 90%.","Brett Hoselton","Thank you gentlemen.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Your line is open.","Dan Levy","This is Dan Levy on for Brian. Thanks for taking the questions. First question are you seeing any signs of program delays from any of your larger customers to may have been impacted by certain issues in the past quarter?","James Verrier","Okay. Let me take a shot at that and answer this answer. I think know maybe which OEM you maybe referring to and the answer is we have not. We have seen no impact on any of our product development activities and we have really not seen anything relative to the engineering activity or launch activity with the customer that I think you are referring to.","Dan Levy","Okay. More broadly on the diesel front, any signs that the diesel activity globally and I guess specifically within Europe still remains intact?","James Verrier","Yes. Thanks for the question. If I can, I think this is kind of an important issue relative to specifically I think the two things that I would like to just address to the group here. The first one is, the Volkswagen specific emissions issue. I think it would be good for us to put some context on that and how that impacts or potentially impacts BorgWarner. Secondly, I will talk a little bit more generically around diesel specifically and any concerns that maybe an overhang on diesel. So let me start with Volkswagen and I think it's really important that I try and provide again some additional clarity and transparency around this.","If I start with the Volkswagen business for BorgWarner it represents about 16% of our total revenue of the company. Significantly 4% of our total sales were a quarter of the Volkswagen business is tied to light vehicle diesel engine products. So I hope that provides a little bit of clarity. So what's really kind of in debate so to speak is about 4% of the total business for BorgWarner on diesel light vehicle products for Volkswagen. When we look from the BorgWarner perspective of the affected engines that have been disclosed by Volkswagen that breaks down to less than 0.5% of total revenue for BorgWarner. I think this is really a critical point I am trying to make because I know you guys have been trying to wrestle with that what's the exposure, what\u2019s the impact to BorgWarner and again the affected engines that Volkswagen have publicly talked about that breaks down to about 0.5% or less of our total revenue stream.","If anybody would like a little bit more clarity and color on how we get to the 0.5% please feel free to follow-up because Ken's happy to provide that additional level of detail. So when I say that it frames it from a BW perspective it's really not a particularly meaningful impact. On top of that I want to be clear that from a schedule and releases perspective to Volkswagen we have seen no impact. We have seen no adjustments, no impact on our schedules. Furthermore I think the other point I will point out relative to specifically on the Volkswagen issue. Our opinion is as they go through the recall transition efforts next year we see that there will be no impact on BorgWarner because our products are not involved in any of the recall solutions. So hopefully that just gives you a little bit of clarity and a little bit of color.","The message fundamentally to that issue is we are not seeing an impact. Now let me quickly transition and take a moment just to talk about the broader perspective of diesel. So I think it's fair to say we have been talking over the last couple of years that the slowdown in diesel adoption has been expected. We have seen that and proactively been managed around that. We still see that transition around a [slowing] adoption of diesel being a relatively slower trend over several years and part of that is because we still see diesel being a key element of the customer's plans to get to the fuel economy and emissions standards.","I want to also give you a little bit of clarity and color, light vehicle diesel sales is about 15% to 20% of total BorgWarner just to give you a frame. So what we are talking about here is what's in play of diesel is about 15% to 20% of total BorgWarner revenue. So that's important. As we -- as the transition moves from diesel to gas we have talked quite openly about this, that in the short run as this transition occurs the way to think of it on a diesel engine for BorgWarner, BorgWarner related on a comparable advanced gasoline engine, BorgWarner gets about 70% of the content on a gas engine versus a diesel engine currently. That actually over time is evolving because we are having more and more content to gasoline engines, such as ETR valves and ETR coolers.","So over the long run and I am talking two, three, five years, gas-diesel will become a relatively neutral event from the BorgWarner perspective. I know I have shared quite a lot of information there but I think I do recognize from the various conversations how important those two issues are relative to BorgWarner and I wanted to take some time to clarify that and hopefully that did. And of course if there is any follow-up questions we could take those now or later through Ken.","Dan Levy","Thank you very much. That's very helpful.","Operator","Your next question comes from Itay Michaeli with Citi. Your line is open.","Itay Michaeli","Great. Thank you. Good morning. Just want to go back to the backlog discussion. Ken with the 55% arithmetic for 2016 and also roughly applied to 2017, the reason I am asking is just because if you kind of apply that it does make the 2020 revenue even if you adjust a little bit for M&A and FX kind of implies an acceleration in the last three years. And if so maybe talk about booking activity and kind of you know the visibility around the trajectory over the next five years or so?","Ken Lamb","It's a great question. So let me answer it this way. So the part where we were talking about making sure that we account for macro rich factors in our backlog, I think that it's fair to say that we intend to apply that thinking to the entire backlog. Now the actual cutting the backlog in half directionally and how that applies to the out years of the backlog is still under development. I can directionally that's probably a pretty fair way to think about it. We have to continue to work through that. But we expect the backlog in those out years to also come down kind of at similar level but again we have to work through that. I am going to let James speak to the 2020 target of $15 billion, but that's kind of in the next few years is kind of the way we are thinking about it.","James Verrier","I think Ken explained that very well. Let me say a couple of things that I think may help a little bit here Itay, because what you are hearing is, you are hearing that there is some macro headwinds sort of a challenge for us a little bit right. It's primarily again China and its commercial vehicle. What I would say is important for people to think about it is, what you are not hearing about is the adoption rates of our technology slowing because we have not seen that We are still seeing continued strong desire and adoption rates for all of our products at a similar rate. That's when we talked you to what we have -- we probably have been talking about the last couple of years.","The reason that's important that still gives us tremendous confidence actually as we look out to the future for the growth of the product. We do recognize this year we faced some headwinds and as Ken said that will spill into '16 and somewhat into '17. But again the adoption rates of our products remain very, very strong from the technology point of view, which leads us to have very good confidence in mid-single-digit growth outlook. Again part of the $15 billion by 2020 is additional acquisitions that we remain focused on. So the fundamental story here, Itay, is not changing. BorgWarner's technology adoption is strong. We are going to be a strong growth company but we are in a little bit of a transition period this year and somewhat into next year as well. But still delivering single-digit growth which we feel is very strong in this industry and clearly obviously we are converting that into strong EPS performance.","Itay Michaeli","That's very helpful and thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joseph Spak","Thanks, good morning everyone. And just to reiterate thanks for all the additional color and commentary. Just going back to Volkswagen mainly from the other side of that equation. I mean they have been out publicly talking about going after some big savings from the supply base to try to deal with some of the costs they are going to have to incur. I was wondering, if that's -- if any of that sort of that creeped into your discussions and if at all or if not how you feel you are positioned to handle with what seems like it would be more difficult conversation going forward?","James Verrier","Yes. Certainly Joe, we sure saw some of the information and we pay a lot of attention to that of course. Frankly at this stage we have not seen I would say meaningful increased pressure specifically around pricing reductions and those types of things. I think our mindset right now, Joe, is it may likely intensify as we go forward. But our belief right now is that we can push back and contain that and stay somewhat in the range of [indiscernible] we have done over many years which is in the 1.5% to 2%. So quick answer, yes, we expect the intensity to come. We feel comfortable about our ability to deal with that and not deviate from our historical annual [IRF] type numbers that we provided.","Joseph Spak","Okay. Just one more on the backlog. I mean you pointed out Ken and Ron that Europe was much lower for next year, which I believe was a result that you are talking about decreased diesel penetration there. So is that -- do you believe that any shift from in diesel and the impact from Volkswagen that's not one of the factors related to the backlog for next year or is that contained in maybe sort of the more conservative macro view you are taking?","Ken Lamb","Yes. That's a good clarification there. So that's a good way to think about it. Our view in diesel has been pretty well-established in the backlog. We brought that up last year, I am sure you remember when we came out with the new backlog back in 2014. So yes, the changes are mostly happening in the areas that we talked about, which would be China and commercial vehicle. Diesel's kind of already built into that. And to James' point earlier, the impact of the Volkswagen issue is diminished. So that's not expected to impact our backlog as we sit here today. So I think as you think about it that the Europe is probably as a percentage of the total backlog is going to go higher because that feels like probably the most stable region for us out of the three between the Americas, Asia and Europe.","Joseph Spak","Okay. I will pass on thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Patrick Archambault","I guess just a couple of follow-ups. The margin improvement in Drivetrain was obviously very, very strong year-on-year. It seems like you posted a little bit of margin improvement as well on the Engine side like 40, 50 basis points. I was just wondering, I think you have laid out the trajectory for further Drivetrain improvements pretty nicely. But how do we think about the growth potential on margins in Engine, are we getting -- are we close to levels that they are likely to be or is there some upside potential there as well?","James Verrier","I would say that our objective has always been mid-teens. Now the question is how you define mid-teens. But I would say that Engine still has room for improvement.","Patrick Archambault","And if you were to benchmark like the main drivers is it just efficiencies with better growth or anything sort of more specific than that?","James Verrier","Well we have a couple of things. One is the growth and being able to convert in the mid-teens is above the average now. That's one area. The second one which is probably more important is the Wahler acquisition is going to gain momentum as time goes on. And quite frankly somewhat of a drag on our margins now as we go forward and then become a double-digit business that will start to move margins up. And then someday I don\u2019t know when commercial vehicle might actually start being a net tailwind for us and that will obviously start driving margins up too. But I am not going to predict that for '16, that's somewhere down the road.","Patrick Archambault","Yes, I hear you on that last one. Just on the revenue side did you -- I mean I guess I will keep this question including FX because I guess that's the simplest way to take it. But your new guidance I guess midpoint of down 5.5% implies that your fourth quarter is down about 2% and you've been down about 7% year-to-date. I understand that currency is probably a big part of that improvement, right, if you think if it's just a delta as we progress year-on-year going from down 7% to down 2%. I guess the F150 would be another piece. I guess what are the -- how do we think about the improvement there?","Ken Lamb","I am going to start this and Ron can follow up. You know a couple of things for Q4. First of all you are right, the F150 is kind of a major mover of our growth in Q4 which was last year and also you have to remember Q4 2014 is where we took a major currency hit. That's when this all kind of started and then that dissipating relative to the previous quarters. So the impact of currency year-over-year is a little bit less, so that's helping us a little bit on the growth side.","Patrick Archambault","Okay. So it sounds like it's those two main things, right?","Ken Lamb","I think that that's fair.","Patrick Archambault","Okay. And then final just one housekeeping for me. The timing of Remy I think you had previously said closing in the fourth quarter are we still on track for that?","James Verrier","Yes. We are Patrick. The only thing really left is the regulatory approval from China which we didn\u2019t process. So we are anticipating an early to mid November closing is what we are on track for as it stands today. So we are looking forward to that for sure.","Patrick Archambault","Okay. Got it. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Colin Langan with UBS. Your line is open.","Colin Langan","Can I have a follow-up on the European light vehicle diesel. When you talk about 15% to 20% of your sales does that -- I mean is that total diesel or is there a chunk in there that's commercial vehicle which would be almost very unlikely to be impacted? And then can you also talk about you relative share in Europe on gas and diesel products? I mean are you pretty balanced on both products or is some -- you have had a strong position in your Europe are you more leveraged today market share wise on diesel products?","James Verrier","Yes. Colin let me take a shot at -- or at least to clarify your first question. And then maybe Ken can offer you a little bit of commentary on the European split between gas and diesel. Just to -- what I wanted to do is to clarify, so light vehicle diesel sales are about 15% to 20% of the total company revenue. If that makes sense to you. So we deliberately wanted to exclude the commercial vehicle piece in terms of how we look at that. So it's 15% to 20% light vehicle diesel sales of our total overall BorgWarner revenue. So that frames it for you. Does that clarify for you?","Colin Langan","Yes. That's exactly about what I was talking about.","Ken Lamb","I will take part two of that. So the commentary that we had made around $0.70 on a $1 of content for advanced gasoline engines versus diesel, that's kind of a direct comment on our mix of business in Europe diesel versus gas, okay. Two other factors, that gap is closing over time. There is going to be more and more content on gas engines as we continue to evolve in that market. We have seen that happening over the last few years and that's going to continue going forward. And secondly our market share for gasoline turbochargers is higher than it is for diesel today and it's only continuing to get stronger going forward. So that's going to give us a bit of a lift as we see the shift from diesel towards gas. A few points higher for gas than it is for diesel.","Colin Langan","Okay. That's very helpful. You talked earlier about take rates being stable, but I think some of the recent award data shows that turbo take rates are flat year-over-year which is consistent but they have been growing for the last few years. Has that been a factor in your outlook for this year that you would have probably anticipated if gas wasn't so cheap that take rates would have actually continued to grow? And when do you think that starts to reaccelerate because I can't getting to the 2025 standards without more turbo adoption?","James Verrier","Yes. Let me take a shot at that. We have not seen a slowdown in [indiscernible] penetration rates at all actually. As we look -- and primarily as you know Colin the two primarily areas of the world are increasing rapidly on penetration is China and North America and we are not seeing slowdown in the adoption rates fundamentally of the technology, if I can start there. What you do see a little bit is of course there is some volume reductions of which we have seen this year in China obviously and we have seen some launch impacts in Asia which could be turbo related. But that's got nothing fundamentally to do with slowdown of adoption rates of turbo. If that helps you?","Colin Langan","That's very helpful. Then just last question, can you give any color on the margin direction? I am trying to bug in the numbers. It seems like margin -- sales should be up a little bit -- margin direction quarter-over-quarter, seems like sales should be up a bit but margins look fairly flattish. I mean how should we think margins [indiscernible]?","Ron Hundzinski","Are you talking sequentially or are you talking into the fourth quarter?","Colin Langan","Yes. To Q4, yes.","Ron Hundzinski","I think if you do the math it will be down slightly sequentially more in line with what you saw in the better half of the year.","Colin Langan","And in fact usually the seasonality better at [indiscernible] production?","James Verrier","Yes. But we have some other offsets going on that we anticipate in the fourth quarter on the costs side that probably might bring that down right now. So that's booked in the guidance. If you do the math on the guidance you will have slightly lower margins in the fourth -- from the third but it will be more in line what you saw in the first half of the year. I am going to even go one step further. You can see that our SG&A expense was quite lower in Q3 and we don\u2019t think that's going to be the run rate going into Q4. The Q4 run rate for SG&A is probably going to be more like the average over the three quarters for the first part of the year. If that helps and certainly in the SG&A line in there.","Colin Langan","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","We have time for one final question and that question comes from Dan Galves with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Dan Galves","To kind of following up on Patrick's question. On organic growth into Q4, it seems like you and the guys need to do somewhere 7%, 8%, 9% in Q4. Can you talk about what your organic growth expectation is specifically for Q4 and if there is a big acceleration from the first three quarters of the year why wouldn't that slow into at least the first half of next year?","Ron Hundzinski","I think that the math indicates that the fourth quarter organic growth about foreign currency is around 5% which is slightly above year-to-date average I guess at this point. I think that's how the math works out. Not -- I think you had a higher number.","Dan Galves","Yes. My mistake. Thanks guys.","Ken Lamb","I\u2019d like to thank all again for joining us. We expect to file our 10-Q before the end of the day, which will provide details of our results. If you have any follow-up questions about our earnings release, with the matters discussed during this call or our 10-Q, please direct them to me. Melissa, please close out the call.","Operator","That does conclude the BorgWarner 2015 third quarter results earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
