Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Kelly Loeffler. Ma'am, you may begin.","Kelly L. Loeffler","Good morning. ICE's third quarter 2013 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of our website at theice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to the company's Form 10-K. Our Form 10-Q has been filed this morning.","Please note that the numbers discussed today refer to our adjusted operating results, which we believe are more reflective of our business performance. You'll find the non-GAAP reconciliation in the earnings release and presentation, as well as an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful and how management uses these measures. The materials presented today reflect futures volume that has been restated to include previously cleared swap contract volumes.","With us on the call this morning are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Chuck Vice, President and Chief Operating Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Scott.","Scott A. Hill","Thank you, Kelly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We delivered revenue growth and double-digit earnings growth in the third quarter and solid revenue and profit growth through the first 9 months of 2013. At the same time, we've advanced our NYSE Euronext integration plan, transitioned Liffe clearing, cleared roughly $3 trillion of buy-side CDS and acquired and integrated ICE Endex. We remain well positioned to continue to serve our customers and create value for our shareholders.","Let's start on Slide 4 with our year-to-date performance. We've delivered top and bottom line growth on top of growth while advancing our integration plans for NYSE Euronext. We've also executed a number of strategic initiatives. On July 1, we seamlessly transferred clearing of the Liffe business to ICE Clear Europe including over $11 billion in margins, $75 million contract size [ph] and 43 clearing members. We completed this transition in just 6 months and have already launched over 70 new Liffe contracts. We also completed the acquisition of a majority stake in ICE Endex in March. And in October, we seamlessly transitioned these markets to our trading platform and clearing house. And in the coming days, we expect to close on the NYSE Euronext transaction, which will further diversify our business by adding a substantial interest rate complex, additional financial indices and the leading global cash equities, equity options and listings venues.","Despite average daily volumes declining 1% for the first 9 months of the year, we were still able to deliver revenue growth of 2%, with adjusted operating margins expanding 2 points to 63%. As a result, we reported earnings growth with adjusted net income up 8% and earnings per share up 7%, year-to-date. We had record volumes across our oil and ag complexes and record open interest in Brent and total oil.","Moving now to Slide 5, I'll discuss our third quarter performance, which included solid revenue growth and double-digit earnings growth. Revenues increased 5% year-over-year to $338 million, driven by 4% growth in Brent revenue, 16% growth in sugar revenue and 15% growth in CDS revenue. Adjusted operating expenses were up only slightly, and margins expanded to 61%. Adjusted net income attributable to ICE grew 10% year-over-year to $145 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share also grew 10% to $1.97. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $180 million, and technology-related capital expenditures and capitalized software were $15 million for the quarter.","Please turn to Slide 6, and I'll review our third quarter consolidated revenues and expenses. Transaction and clearing revenues were flat at $280 million. Energy revenue decreased 4% year-over-year, primarily due to a 23% decline in natural gas volumes, but partially offset by the strength in our global oil and agricultural complexes. Total oil revenues grew 6%, driven by Brent and other oil revenues, which grew 4% and 19%, respectively. Ag revenues grew 11% year-over-year driven by strength in sugar volumes. Financial revenue grew 12% year-over-year with CDS clearing revenue rising 40% over the prior year. Finally, market data revenue grew 12% to $40 million.","Details of our operating expenses are shown on the right side of Slide 6. Adjusted operating expenses increased 1% compared to the prior third quarter. The growth in technology and SG&A expenses was largely driven by the addition of ICE Endex. The decline in compensation expenses reflects a reduced 2013 bonus accrual. As we have consistently demonstrated, we have a pay-for-performance culture that provides alignment with our shareholders, so we continue to generate top and bottom line growth and strong returns on investment, we benchmark our financial performance objectives to a higher standard. We will come in modestly below our full year objectives due to the weakness in North American natural gas revenues, and we adjusted our bonus accruals accordingly during the quarter. We now expect full year operating expenses for 2013 to increase by slightly more than 1%.","Let's move now to Slide 7 and review the third quarter performance of our futures markets. Futures revenue decreased 2% over the prior third quarter on a 1% decrease in average daily volumes. Low volatility in natural gas prices resulted in a 23% decrease in natural gas volumes for the quarter compared to the prior year. In contrast, our oil market grew at a healthy rate during the quarter, with WTI, global oil, RBOB and heating oil posting double-digit growth in average daily volume. Brent and sugar average daily volume grew 5% and 9%, respectively, and revenue captured trends remained healthy across ICE's futures markets.","As we noted in our volume press release yesterday, revenue capture remained steady in October, while average daily volumes declined 1%, largely impacted by natural gas volume and a more muted month for oil market. ADV and ag remained strong with double-digit growth in October, and financials ADV were up 8%.","Please turn to Slide 8 for an update of our oil and natural gas markets. There are a few points I want to highlight here. First, we had the leading global crude and refined oil benchmarks in addition to key benchmarks across natural gas, power and emissions. Second, as you can see on the top left of this slide, our global oil complex continues to benefit from a number of fundamental growth drivers. For the first 9 months of the year, average daily volume on our global oil complex was up 10%, with Brent volumes growing 8% including Brent options growth of 13%. Total Brent open interest is up 10% from the prior year. Average daily volume for our global oil products grew even faster over the first 9 months, up 25% over the same period in 2012. We continue to see momentum in oil markets as a result of the importance of Brent and the relationship with other global oil products, which in many cases are priced as a differential of Brent. Additionally, emerging market countries continue to increase their hedging activities to manage risk and participate in global price discovery. This is reflected in our total oil open interest, which was up 17% year-over-year to 8 million contracts.","Now let's turn to the North America natural gas markets. As we already noted, low volatility in this market has reduced demand for hedging during 2013. As you can see in the chart on the bottom right, in periods of price volatility, there are corresponding volume increases. In 2008 and 2009, much like 2012 and '13, prices have been range bound, which was reflected in lower trading volumes. Importantly, we continue to see the emergence of North American natural gas as a growing source of energy, which will support the continued need for an expanding customer base to hedge, trade and mitigate risk. And we continue to believe that natural gas has the potential to evolve into a global market. We are well positioned strategically for this evolution, with our strong presence in serving both the North American and European natural gas markets.","On Slide 9, I'll discuss our credit derivatives results. Third quarter CDS revenues grew 15% to $38 million. This included $16 million from Creditex and $22 million from global CDS clearing. Through October, we have cleared $46 trillion in gross notional value, we offer clearing in roughly 400 instruments, and we have now cleared over $3 trillion for our buy-side customers. Today, more than 300 buy-side firms are actively clearing CDS on ICE. We have the most liquid clearing platform across index, single names and sovereign instruments and now offer buy-side clearing in North America and Europe. And importantly, our CDS clearing business is generating meaningful revenues, profits and cash.","While CDS clearing activity remains strong, the credit derivatives execution business remains muted as regulations have only recently been introduced. We launched ICE Swap Trade on October 2, offering trading activity in credit default swap markets. We continue to work with market participants as they weigh the new regulatory requirements and timeline. As was true with many aspects of CDS clearing, we don't expect to see a meaningful recovery in CDS execution until trading on SEF platforms becomes mandatory. However, as more SEFs emerge, we are actively working with them to provide clearing services.","I'll wrap up my comments on Slide 10 with a review of our cash generation, balance sheet and return on investments. In the first 9 months of the year, we generated $562 million of operating cash flow and held $1.6 billion in unrestricted cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we generated industry-leading 18% returns on invested capital. Of note, in preparation for the closing of our NYSE Euronext acquisition, we successfully raised $1.4 billion of debt on October 8. We issued $600 million of 5-year senior notes at a 2.5% coupon and $800 million of 10-year senior notes at a 4% coupon. Our inaugural debt rating from S&P and Moody's were A and A3, respectively, with each firm noting a positive bias upon the successful execution of our integration of NYSE Euronext and our plan to delever to or below 1.5x adjusted EBITDA within the first 18 to 24 months post-close.","We will provide much more detail on our financing and capital structure in the near future. But as noted on this slide, we have a clear set of priorities with regards to capital allocation. And importantly, we believe the cash flows from our combined companies will enable us to execute each of these strategies. We will institute a roughly $300 million annual dividend. And accordingly, as we noted in our earnings release this morning, ICE's Board has approved a quarterly cash dividend of $75 million for the fourth quarter of 2013 contingent upon the closing of the NYSE Euronext transaction. We will also continue to invest in growth in a disciplined manner. And finally, we have $450 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization.","With that, I encourage you to review the guidance we provided in the press release, and I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. Jeff, over to you.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Scott's just taken you through our financial results, so I'd like to discuss our operational achievements before I provide some remarks on our pending acquisition of NYSE Euronext.","During the quarter, the ICE team completed and advanced a number of major initiatives. We seamlessly transitioned the ICE Endex business onto the ICE platform and its clearing into ICE Clear Europe. We work with market participants to better align the Brent futures contract specifications to that of the underlying physical market. We completed our first quarter of clearing of the Liffe business across interest rate, equity and soft commodity derivatives, clearing an average of 3 million contracts per day. Finally, we made significant progress on our integration planning together with NYSE Euronext. I want to thank both of our teams for their cooperative efforts while continuing to focus on serving the needs of our customers. We completed all these initiatives while delivering double-digit earnings growth and margin expansion. As a result, we're very well positioned to integrate NYSE Euronext and capitalize on a range of new growth opportunities ahead.","Our track record on Slide 11 shows a variety of unique ways that we've leveraged our capabilities, demonstrating technology leadership and entrepreneurial customer-oriented culture and a focus on innovation by embracing change. We're ready and we're eager to begin writing the next chapter of our growth story, and believe that NYSE Euronext's broad range of valuable businesses provide many opportunities to do so. We've made significant progress in integration planning and expect to receive final approval for closing our transaction in the coming days.","In the year 2000, we were among the first to realize the potential for commodities to trade in electronic markets with greater liquidity, access and transparency. By today's standards, this accomplishment seems like a given or even a detail. But at that time, our technology-driven model was transformative and controversial for its paradigm-shifting nature. It enabled trading to move from the regional confines of a telephone to a global connected market where more companies can participate. At the time, many predicted that our moves would fail, assuming that commodities markets were too complex to trade electronically. We were listening to our customers, and we delivered on their needs. We were among the first to see a connection between futures and over-the-counter markets, and we became a model that global legislatures would require for markets a decade later. And our transition of over 800 OTC contracts to futures contracts was the result of our years of work, advancing the standardization and the risk management practices of the U.S. and global energy markets. This trend is now playing out in interest rates, credit and other swap markets.","When we acquired the International Petroleum Exchange of London in 2001, we began to support the growth of the exchanges' Brent Crude Oil futures contract, which then had less than 25% market share. Today, its reach has been extended, and it now has a more than 50% market share. We've expanded from 1 asset class to 6 asset classes, and we'll expand again to 9 asset classes once we close the NYSE Euronext transaction. Our focus on transparency and delivering connectivity drove structural shifts that were positive for the market, none of which would have been possible without our vision for the vital role of clearing houses in the global market.","In 2007, when we announced that we would build our own clearing house, many people said that it could not be done. But our team successfully completed the task and has since led the next wave of clearing, and this includes solving for complex risks in the credit default swap market and transferring a vast interest rate futures complex to our infrastructure with a 6-month timeframe.","Just like the other successful transactions that you can see on the slide here, we're going to work diligently to integrate NYSE Euronext, identify new growth opportunities, extend our clearing services and improve upon market structure. These are all things that we've done before through different economic cycles and different regulatory environments. We'll be evaluating our new businesses to ensure alignment with both our customers' expectations as a global leader in markets and shareholders' expectations for ICE as a growth company.","We've built or integrated a dozen companies over the last 13 years, and we've met or exceeded our promised expense synergies and grown the businesses that we've acquired. With our acquisition of the New York Board of Trade in 2007, we exceeded our stated synergies, because we were able to significantly grow the business and leverage its clearing platform. We saw a significant opportunity in clearing as more market participants became focused on reducing counterparty risk. And after the financial crisis, there was a need to manage the risks associated with credit derivatives, and we competed with much larger and more established clearing houses to develop what has become the leading credit clearing infrastructure. As a result, our credit clearing revenues have more than doubled over the last 4 years and allowed us to develop expertise that will allow us to be competitive in expanding our OTC clearing into other asset classes.","We've also established a culture of not only complying with regulation but applying oversight directly through our investment in systems. We took a leadership role in implementing market safety measures including pre-trade credit checks, volume-weighted messaging ratios to manage high-frequency trading and the implementation of position limits in over-the-counter markets. More recently, we've extended our reach into several emerging markets. These markets are still relatively new in terms of hedging and managing risk, but we see significant opportunity ahead. We reached directly into Brazil with our 2 strategic initiatives, Cetip and BRIX, which are performing well.","These examples and moments in our history are important because they demonstrate our forward thinking, and we'll continue to apply this approach to the new markets as we work with market participants to gain their feedback for additional products and services. This is the same approach that we use to develop the over 60 new energy products that we'll be launching this month.","We'll also focus on building our intellectual property portfolio through the administration of the LIBOR benchmark. We've recognized the importance of intellectual property and how we're able to distribute it via our network by leveraging the Internet, mobile and chat. We look forward to having an enhanced index portfolio coupled to a thriving equity options and futures business, and we'll continue to speak with market participants and regulators to improve the cash equity's trading business and the confidence in markets for retail and institutional investors alike.","On Slide 12, you can see why we remain confident in our ability to become the global market leader for trading and risk management. We will have the leading multi-asset-class risk management system, unparalleled clearing infrastructure and strong cash flow generation. And we'll focus on creating significant value for our customers and our shareholders. I'm quite proud of the considerable amount of integration planning that both of our teams have done over the last 10 months. And as a result of everyone's hard work, we have detailed integration plans that we can begin executing on immediately.","I know many of you on the call have questions about ICE and NYSE Euronext as a combined company. We're going to be limited today in what we can address because we have not completed the transaction. However, shortly after the closing, we do plan to host another investor call to discuss the combined business in great detail.","In summary, as you can see on Slide 13, we continue to deliver strong top and bottom line results and best-in-class returns. Going forward, we'll focus on integrating the NYSE Euronext business while continuing to look for new growth opportunities. We want to drive growth across all of our businesses and achieve our new objectives.","So on behalf of everyone at ICE, I want to thank our customers, again, for trusting us with their business.","And I'll now ask Shannon, our operator, to conduct the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","First question, just a small item is, Scott, in the other revenue you see a nice uptick -- and I know you mentioned Endex, you mentioned getting the Liffe clearing. But can you tell us what the breakout as you've went up in plus-$5-million quarter-to-quarter, and then what it should look like going forward? Like what came from what in the quarter and the outlook?","Scott A. Hill","Yes, Rich. No problem. It's the things you mentioned. It's Endex. It's us picking up some treasury income from the higher margin balances we've picked up from the Liffe clearing, and it's the modest charge that we billed NYX for the clearing of Liffe in the third quarter. And our expectation, as you move to the fourth quarter, is that other revenue should be stable at this higher level.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then just one broader follow-up, Jeff. While anticipating the call after the closing and I know you can't give details that wouldn't be -- I heeded your warning in the prepared remarks. But can you just tell us in generic terms, are we going to get a look at what businesses you like versus dislike? Have you reached that -- in just general terms, have you reached those types of decisions, or is there still a process of allowing them to operate and see how they work and blend in with the overall operation, if you follow my question?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Yes, I do follow your question. And I think the good news for investors is that in the 10-month period since we announced the deal, we've made much more progress than I think we anticipated that we would. We've done a deeper dive into how the combined company can operate, and we have a very informed view of what businesses we're going to put where and how we're going to go to market and who we're going to put in charge of those businesses and how we can better organize the combined company. I do expect that as soon as we close this deal, which I hope will be, literally, in a matter of days, that we'll be able to get back on the phone with you and spend a significant amount of time in great detail to inform the market on how we think about these things.","Operator","Our next question is from Howard Chen of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Jeff, there's been a lot of discussions in the dealers on supplemental leverage ratios. You've always been a problem solver for the dealer community, and you've done a lot of these tariffs and compressions since you bought Creditex. I was just wondering what you and the team are seeing and hearing, realtime, from the dealers? And is there still, in your view, a large opportunity to help further alleviate leverage for the system?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","That's a very good question. I mean one of the things, if you look at the slide -- they may be obvious. But if you look at the slide of our CDS clearing revenue, you see that how many trillions of dollars have come in, and the net open interest has actually been relatively stable, even though the notional amount coming in has been increasing. What that's saying is that a lot of the over-the-counter markets can really collapse down into a small amount of fundamental risk, that's obviously why legislators and regulators have been pushing more business into clearing to get that compaction. But what that means is that it's truly a lower overall amount of capital that's needed. I see the business that we touch, specifically the cleared futures business and cleared swaps business, as really changing the dealer and clearing infrastructure into one that is much more akin to lending. I think going forward, capital is going to -- high-quality capital is going to be needed in clearing houses. And as a result of that, banks that can analyze their customers' balance sheets and lend them the capital to put up in clearing house against the trades is really a lending business. That is slightly different than the way it operated before, but it means that the business is going to compete with other forms of lending. It means that customers will go through credit committees in their trading practices as well as their borrowing practices. And I think that will be very, very healthy for the market. And I think that we started to see that banks and intermediaries that are very, very well positioned to analyze risk and to lend, I think, are going to do well. It should be a high return on capital business for those that can manage it well with relatively modest risk.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's really interesting. And my follow-up is on the financial targets, longer term. I know you all hold yourselves to this really high standard of double-digit -- high standard of double-digit top line and bottom line growth, I'm just curious, Scott or Jeff, as you complete the 2014 planning, the bottom line target seems it has more within your control to achieve. But I was wondering if you're thinking at all about recalibrating that double-digit top line growth target, just given factors that are out of your control and the changing business mix?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Yes, it's a good question, and the answer is no. We have really taken great pains internally as we've thought about the way we integrate to keep the culture of growth and innovation in the combined company. And you saw that in this quarter we had double-digit earnings growth. But a lot of what we've been able to do as managers is, even though we had a 23% downturn in natural gas trading, which was historically a flagship product for us, we still returned double-digit growth. We did that by managing what we can manage, since we can't manage volatility, and that is our cost structure. We -- I -- Scott, Chuck and I meet every 2 weeks and go through every employee request, every hire, every termination and manage the headcount of this business with extreme accuracy. We spend a tremendous amount of time calibrating our own compensation internally with consultants and with our board to make sure we continue to have a pay-for-performance culture, and all of that helps us to motivate the company and focus it on delivering that bottom line, and that's what we can do as managers, and that's not going to change.","Scott A. Hill","And, Howard, I'd just add too -- because I've seen a couple of notes go out, what happens with the tax rate is no less a strategic and operational decision. The tax rate is coming down because the U.K. corporate tax rate is coming down, and we built a business thoughtfully in London to -- with one of the reasons being it's a very conducive business environment. So I completely agree with Jeff in terms of how we manage hiring and expenses, but the way we've thought about strategically positioning our businesses geographically contributes to the tax rate, which also contributes to our ability to grow double-digit earnings in the quarter. So that's not something, I think, people should just write-off. And again, I think where we're headed is towards the lower end of the tax range guidance that we've talked about in the past of 27% to 30%. And over the long-term, assuming the U.K. continues to behave in the manner they have, that will only improve.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That all makes a lot of sense to me, but, I think, just to comeback, Scott, you mentioned the taxes, which makes a lot of sense, and I know you and the team work hard on that. Jeff, you mentioned sort of headcount expenses and controlling what you can control. I guess if I was to delineating between the top line and the bottom line target, again, I think, what kind of drives confidence that you can continue to achieve double-digit top line growth, given just low volatility -- bouts of low volatility or limited price action on certain asset classes?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Yes, I think -- again, once we close the deal, we'll be able to give you more information about how we're thinking about the combined business. But generally speaking, what we are good at is running transaction businesses that are following market trends where a lot of innovation matters. And we know what we do well here, and we know what we don't do well here. And I think what has allowed us to do well is by editing and curating our own behavior so that we focus on areas where we can make a difference and not on areas where we can't. And in the combined company, that's how we've been thinking about the joint opportunities that, together, we will have, which I think really can drive a lot of growth.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So this simple, you guys cleared Liffe business this quarter. How much in revenue, all-in, was associated with that business this quarter?","Scott A. Hill","It was a relatively modest amount, Ken, and it helped drive the other revenue up quarter-to-quarter. A couple of million bucks, nothing overly meaningful.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","By the way, Ken, recall that we entered into the Liffe contract when we were 2 separate companies, and it was in ICE's best interest to offer Liffe a very attractive clearing deal so that we could convince it to move off of its own initiative to build the clearing house. Because that was in the best interest of what, ultimately, will be a combined Liffe and ICE company.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Makes sense. And then I'll try to dance the line of New York as well. But the role [indiscernible] of the New York Stock Exchange has been, in the past, in part to promote the brand. And with the combination of Direct Edge and BATS creating an exchange with almost as much volume or arguably as much volume as the New York Stock Exchange, it would seem that role is still important. So, Jeff, based on all the things that you have to do and like to do, how big a priority is it to take on the additional responsibility as both champion of and spokesperson for the New York Stock Exchange, and is that something that you think you want to do, or is that something that you delegate to another member of the team?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, first of all, I don't think I would be very good at it. And so I know my own limitations. So it's alluring as a manager, but it's not my expertise, and so I'm glad that Duncan Niederauer is staying for at least a year, so that he can continue in that role. But with respect to competition, let me just -- I do have strong views of the way the U.S. cash equities business operates, and I've been pretty transparent about those. So it's not that I'm benign, but let me just mention to you that the New York Stock Exchange is a very special place, and I think it's probably inherent in your question about who is going to be the spokesperson for. Because every day, there are people that have to trade. There are index funds that have to rebalance. There are funds that have redemption, that have to trade and sell shares. And there are people like you and I who have investments in our life savings who have to send our children to school or buy a new house or, hopefully, start a new business. And on that day, they have to sell. And a lot of the market model of what you're talking about is a market model that takes advantage of the fact that those people, on that day, have to sell. And that means that they can be charged usury rates, and that means that they can have poorer information than people that they trade against when they put a market order in. And in the infrastructure of trading today is intermediaries who people are turning to, hopefully -- and exchanges -- that people are turning to, hoping that they will have a duty of care. But in reality, those people are incented to take advantage of the people that are the weakest on the day they have to trade. And I think that, that is fundamentally wrong. I think people that have built a business around that are destined to ultimately fail. I don't think they are sustainable. And increasingly, when I go talk to friends and when I listen to people that are not involved specifically in what we do, there's a sense that things aren't fair, and that is the collective wisdom, increasingly, of the market. We're starting to finally see people openly talk about market structure changes and, fundamentally, revisiting why it is that we have equity exchanges. And I think we have equity exchanges so that companies like ICE that can start from nothing can attach to the capital markets to raise capital, to build businesses, create jobs and be innovative and helpful to society. I think the secondary market that takes advantage of people that have to trade or have poor information is not particularly wanted or helpful or sustainable. And so I'm anxious to be involved in the U.S. cash equities business from the sense that I think the New York Stock Exchange is incredibly well positioned. I think the market model is going to change. I think people in the business want it to change. And hopefully, by being transparent about it, we will be a positive force in causing the change.","Operator","Our next question is from Mike Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Jeff, maybe, one, on the New York transaction, there's been a lot of focus on whether it's the synergies, the cash flow opportunities, things that are very clear and you guys have touched on. There hasn't been as much focus on the revenue opportunities. I know it's still early. Maybe just give a sense, where are the areas that you guys are looking at that you could potentially see revenue synergies versus either the cost or the cash flow opportunities?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Thank you for that. We justify, internally, our ability to do M&A by our ability to control cost because that's what the market expects us to do. But as you are alluding to, the reality is, as managers, we're looking to the real revenue opportunities and how we can really increase our return on invested capital by growing the top line. We don't advertise it because it's not necessarily accepted or appreciated, but it's definitely part of our thinking. When this business comes together, we're going to be, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, a multi-asset class company with a really good clearing infrastructure at a moment in time when people are going to want as much portfolio margining and cross collateralization as is acceptable within the constraints of operating a secure market. Secondly, we are going to be a massive data provider. What you've seen over time is that people used to buy data, consolidated data, that was very, very spread out through the markets and data aggregators aggregated it up and sold terminals and feeds to people. And what you're seeing over time is a recognition that it's not the terminal or the feed that is important, it's the underlying data. And that data is increasingly consolidated around exchanges and clearing house and, ultimately, SEFs. And so I think you're going to see fundamental changes in the way the data business operates. You've been seeing that trend already, ICE has increasingly been getting more and more in the data business. And now we're going to have an amazing data set. Lastly, with more attention being paid on the physical markets and the way price formation happens on the benchmarks, you're increasingly going to see regulatory scrutiny on the way those benchmarks and other things are built up and compiled. That, again, lends itself to a company like ours that has a strong regulatory infrastructure, compliance infrastructure and relationship with end users, that's why we're excited about, ultimately, Liffe's successful acquisition of the LIBOR contract. We produced Brent settlement prices here and we're going to be acquiring, as part of the deal, we already have a relationship with Russell. We're going to be acquiring a relationship with FTSE, with [indiscernible], MSCI. So increasingly, our intellectual property portfolio of data that can be disseminated will be meaningful.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then, Scott, just a follow-up, just on the comp, I understand what you're saying and just in terms of in line with the operating metrics and taking down the expenses. I think I understand it, but just when you think about the third quarter, just so we don't get ahead of ourselves, that's partially a true-up, meaning, you're looking at the full year and then truing up in the quarter. So there's some of that, that will be ongoing but some of that's going to be a catch-up for the rest of the year. I just want to make sure I understand that.","Scott A. Hill","No, no, that's exactly right. In the quarter, it was an adjustment of just under $5 million to true up for the year. So that obviously will not repeat itself in the fourth quarter. My expectation, just to kind of help you guys a little bit on the direction, is we're averaging right now, if you adjust for that comp accrual, about $135 million a quarter. We've got a transition payment related to the Endex transition in October that would be about $1 million. So I suspect we'll be somewhere in the $136 million plus or minus range in expenses in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Allen of Evercore Partners.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just thinking longer-term, I mean, given the breadth of the platform in terms of the asset classes you're going to be in, the clearing capabilities, the market data and balancing -- and thinking about organic investment requirements moving forward and balancing that against the potential cash flow generation of the combined company, I'm just trying to think of what examples there could be for meaningful organic investment outside of the things we're already contemplating -- over the counter clearing, for example. Maybe you can kind of potentially give us some examples of any real organic investment requirements you guys see moving forward? That would be helpful.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Sure. We're very well situated with our own platforms and infrastructure to integrate businesses and take costs out of them, and we're acquiring a lot of great assets together, NYSE and Euronext and ICE will have to edit and curate. I think in terms of organic investment, to protect our growth businesses, there's nothing revolutionary there. I do think though there's fundamental change going on in our markets. And as a result of that, there will be winners and losers. And those that can adapt to change will do well and those that can't are -- you can already see companies that are not adapting and, to me, they are failing. Whether or not those are interesting opportunities that -- if they come to market or not, to be determined. But increasingly, we have a total, in almost every asset class, that, organically, we can work from, which is really an interesting place for us to be.","Operator","Our next question is from Alex Kramm of UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So I understand that this might be a complete waste of a question but, again, disclaimer at the beginning. But Scott, given that NYX also reported results this morning, and obviously you did. Do you have numbers for us in terms of any sort of adjustments we should be thinking about for pro formas, i.e., revenue adjustments, intangible amortization, any other merger expenses, or do we have to stay tuned here?","Scott A. Hill","You can stay tuned. But I tell you, it hasn't changed a lot in terms of some of the things you mentioned. But from what we discussed earlier, I think the intangibles that go away on the NYX side are going to look a lot like the intangibles we put in place, so it's roughly a push. But I think our intention would be, as Jeff alluded to in his prepared remarks, is to go into a lot more detail on that, on synergies, on the balance sheet, on the call in the next couple of weeks.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, understood. And then maybe, I know this is about the deal too, so maybe a little too early as well. But Jeff, in particular, on the tech business, I think there's been more and more questions coming out. And bigger picture, I think, you've taken a bigger look at that business, I think you've talked to bankers about like opportunities there. So in the early days, do you think there are a lot of opportunities to change that business around? And maybe more specifically, I think there's a couple of business in there that are actually losing money, and just wondering what you -- how was your appetite as to cut the cords thoroughly relative to, maybe, the previous management teams that had long-term aspirations for those businesses?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Yes, I mean, I think the nice thing about our merger is we have a much bigger scale and platform, so that no one business is particularly material. So it gives us license to take a look at them and say, \"Do we want to make a long-term play here, or is it outside of our core competence? And is it something that -- it may be better for others to invest in?\" And we've done that -- we've already done that on a business-by-business basis and very, very detailed -- of not just the technology business, but all of the businesses that we have in our combined portfolio. And I'll talk about it in the next few weeks. We've made a lot of headway in how we can move. I think what we'll see is, as a result of that relatively quickly after the deal closes, we can start to affect the integration of those parts of the business that work well for us and separation from those parts of business that are better owned by others.","Operator","Our next question is from the Niamh Alexander of KBW.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","On the energy, if I could go back ICE stand-alone because it's still the biggest driver of the revenue that we see, what could you share with us or update us in terms of the gas markets and just maybe some of the structural issues in the physical delivery and supply of gas, are you encouraged by maybe some of the changes over the last 6 months or so? Help us think about what might happen in here, what we should be looking for that maybe could help kind of resuscitate some of the trading activity with a normalized supply-demand imbalance.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","I think what we are seeing is that the volatility in natural gas this year is about half of what it was last year. So, volatility is still a major driver of people's hedging activity. More recently, we've seen some cold weather in the United States that has -- and we've had with some very big days on days when there's sort of unexpectedly cold weather. We're getting back into the weather months of heating for much of the United States and North America that will -- that unexpected behavior there tends to drive trading for us. But more broadly, we still are very bullish on natural gas and that's why we bought Endex, in addition to giving us an exchange in Continental Europe, which is important to us given regulatory changes going on, important for us to have a toehold there. It gives us a closer dialogue with the continental market. We've already had a very strong position in the U.K. market, and we're working, obviously, down in Brazil, in the energy markets down there. We have a strong investment in Asia on energy markets. And we tend to think that natural gas is going to globalize, and that United States with this shale gas and variable cost gas and technology that's increasing is going to create demand for natural gas to move around the world. So we're making a long-term global play in gas. It's frustrating that there hasn't been a lot of volatility. It's probably good for us as consumers, but frustrating for those of us that manage risk management. And it's one of those things that can just change on a moment's notice due to weather and supply disruption, everything else that goes on in the gas business.","Scott A. Hill","And you add to that the fact that in Europe, I mean, North American natural gas clearly was down, but European natural gas revenues were up over 30% year-over-year in the third quarter. So our investments there are starting to pay off. And as it does become a more global commodity, I think our presence in both geographies is going to be a meaningful competitive advantage.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. Thanks, that's helpful. And then, I guess it is kind of merger-related, nonmerger-related, but your play on kind of the market structure reform, OTC clearing houses and whatnot, clearly, you kind of got your strong position in the credit clearing. What does NYX bring to the table, or what does it open up for you? I mean you've got more in your clearing houses right now that you could kind of maybe offer clients that could net against, but help me think about where you see other opportunities coming out of the market structure reform?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, obviously, with the Liffe clearing business moving into our clearing house, we've also been moving into the clearing of interest rate futures markets. And as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, just since making that move, we've launched dozens of new interest rate products that Liffe had a desire to get into. But we're in a unique position in the rates business where with the Liffe business -- the Liffe U.S. business and the LIBOR administration, we've kind of bracketed the U.S. Europe and in the futures space and LIBOR gives us a position in the cash space. We've got a great OTC platform that, as you we mentioned, we built in the credit space and all the relationships and workflow connectivity there. So I think it'll give us a platform to go after more unique businesses in the rate space and things that are related to interest that will have an offset against that futures portfolio. That's been a very powerful tool that others have been using, as you've seen, and I would expect that we'll find some meaningful share of business with customers that are capital sensitive and capital constrained.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","So you think you could take some share from a very large incumbent, maybe, in interest rate swaps clearing?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","I don't know that -- I don't know that I would think of it in share and in fact, I don't think -- we never run the business to take share, because you can buy market share in this industry. And I'm looking at, can we create innovative products that have meaningful value for customers. And those may be new things that we'll ultimately report on probably as share of an increasing market. But I do think the pie for people in this business will be getting bigger and I think the opportunities for those that can navigate that will do well. We are starting with an interest rate platform that is very European-centric inside Liffe. We've got a customer clearing model already rolled out for credit there and a lot of infrastructure and workflow to deal with trade allocation and other things. So we have a neat portfolio of tools that I think will allow us to find a way to enter that business that will be accretive for our shareholders.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo Securities.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So some of your exchange peers have recently announced or instituted fee increases in data. I'm just wondering if you guys see any opportunities to increase fees either there or anywhere else on your platform? And as we think about the merged entity, do you guys think the combination will give you a little bit more pricing power than maybe ICE had on a stand-alone basis?","Scott A. Hill","Yes, I don't think we've historically looked at it as do we have pricing power. I think we've looked at it as, do we have data that our customers find valuable? Are there packages of that information that we can put together that will be more valuable? And it's interesting that some people are moving now, we've been moving on that front for the past 2 years. In fact, if you look at our Market Data revenues in the quarter at $40 million, I think, I said in my prepared remarks, that's up 12% year-over-year. And that's because we did increase the prices. But again, it's not because we had any particular power, it's because as we continue to add more products, more asset classes on our exchange, we've got data that's more interesting and more valuable to our customers, and so they're willing to pay more to get access to more.","Operator","Our next question is from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just focusing on ICE's kind of core energy product and looking outside of nat gas and Brent, pretty nice growth, year-over-year, of 25%, and I understand a lot of it is power driven. But as you guys kind of look out into the next year, what are the 1 or 2 products that you're most excited about in the overall energy complex for growth aside from Brent and nat gas?","Scott A. Hill","I think the one that really dished in the quarter and for the year are our global oil products, which are the former OTC oil products, continue to perform very well. And our expectations are that, that will continue as we move forward. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, a lot of those products' prices, differentials off Brent, the trading in those products also helps with additional trading in Brent. So our WTI volumes have been good. RBOB and heating oil are relatively small but are growing quickly. So as I look across the portfolio of the oil products, we feel very good about all of the oil products. I tell you the other things is we're kind of in the midst of budget season, one of the leading indicators for agricultural products tends to be open interest. Open interest across our total ag complex is up as we're getting towards the end of the year. Sugar volumes have been great but more importantly, sugar OI has been building. So as I look across the complex, I'm very bullish on the opportunities that exist in our oil and our ag complex. And again, frankly, as Jeff said, with natural gas I look at our OI balance, a little bit of volatility move will mean good things for us in terms of volume in that business.","Operator","I'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Sprecher for closing remarks.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Thank you, Shannon. Let me just say we're excited about where we're positioned in the company and the work that lies ahead for us. I'm going to look forward along with Scott, Chuck and Kelly to get back to you on a similar call, shortly, to discuss the combined company, once we close on our NYSE Euronext deal.

Please also note today's event is being recorded.","And I'd like to turn the conference call over to Warren Gardiner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.","Warren Gardiner, CFA - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Good morning.

Also with us on the call today are: Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Ben Jackson, our President.","I'll now turn the call over to Scott.","Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Thanks, Warren. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. I'll start on slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our first quarter. 2018 is off to an excellent start. ICE's consolidated first quarter net revenues increased 5% year-over-year to a record $1.2 billion. Data services revenues were $520 million and grew 6% organically. Trading and clearing net revenues increased 11% to $596 million.","This solid revenue growth was supported by operating expenses which totaled $494 million for the quarter, slightly below our guidance and down 1% year-over-year. Our revenue growth and expense management generated adjusted operating margins of 60%, up 3 percentage points, and adjusted operating income of $731 million, a 9% increase over last year's first quarter.","Looking to the second quarter of 2018, we expect adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $500 million to $510 million, including a full quarter of 2018 compensation changes and the anticipated ramp up of key investment.","For the full year, disciplined expense management has mitigated the continued pressure of the weaker dollar even as it benefits our revenues, allowing us to lower the high-end of our expense guidance to $2.040 billion from $2.050 billion.","During the first quarter, our bottom line also benefited from another solid quarter at MERS. We have nearly completed our work to deliver the new technology platform that will enable the next phase of our strategy to support automation in the mortgage market. We also received a $15 million annual dividend related to our 10% stake in Euroclear, a nice early return on investment. And in February, a member of our executive committee joined the Euroclear board.","Our first quarter adjusted tax rate of 23% benefited from stock vesting in the quarter but was negatively impacted by some unintended consequences of U.S. tax reform related to federal and state taxation of our foreign income. 5% revenue growth, 9% adjusted operating income growth, and a lower adjusted tax rate combined to generate record adjusted earnings per share of $0.90, up 22% from the first quarter of 2017.","Additionally, we generated operating cash flow in the first quarter of $573 million. We've used that cash to repurchase nearly $400 million of stock year-to-date through April, and to return $140 million through our first quarter dividend. All that adds up to more than $0.5 billion of capital returned to our shareholders through April, a 28% increase from the same time a year ago. And importantly, adjusted for the benefit of the recent federal tax law change, our ROIC improved by 30 basis points from the fourth quarter and remains well above our cost of capital.","Now, please turn to slide 5 where I'll discuss the data and listing segment. Data services revenues were up 6% organically year-over-year. Adjusted margins in the data and listing segment increased by 3 percentage points to 52%. Within data services, pricing and analytics revenues were up 6% organically and signings were up 20%, driven by continued strong performance in our pricing and reference data services.","Exchange data grew 3% organically in the quarter. This growth was driven by exchange data related to our futures business which was up 4% year-over-year. Importantly, current growth in our futures exchange data has often proven to be a leading indicator of future growth in trading in our markets. And finally, desktop and connectivity revenue was up 10% organically driven by rising demand for our global connectivity solution reflected in a 14% increase in capacity.","Turning to listings, revenue increased 6% organically year-over-year. The NYSE posted its best first quarter for IPOs since 2011, raising over $10 billion in proceeds through 22 offerings despite a number of spikes in the equity market volatility during the period.","Let's move next to slide 6. In an effort to provide more transparency and help with the modeling of our data business, we're providing you with incremental detail around our annual subscription value or ASV. ASV provides a point in time snapshot of subscription revenues under contract. And while it does not include revenue from products such as a consolidated tape or future signings, erosion or price increases, at around 90% of our business, it is an important metric to consider as you think about the forward momentum of our data services franchise.","At the end of the first quarter, our ASV stood at nearly $1.9 billion and when adjusted for M&A and currency impacts, ASV is up 6.5% year-over-year which is an acceleration from 6% growth entering the year. This supports our continued confidence in our ability to deliver 6% to 7% revenue growth in 2018 and to achieve our long-term target of mid to high-single digits. That confidence is further supported by the 20% growth in pricing and analytics signings and 14% increase in network capacity I previously mentioned.","Turning to slide 7, I'll provide an overview of our trading and clearing business. Trading and clearing revenue increased 11% year-over-year in the first quarter. Total ADV increased 4% year-over-year supported by continued strength across our oil franchise including record Gasoil volumes. In addition, we had solid contributions from our Ag, interest rates and equity index offerings including a record sterling and MSCI volumes. Cash equities and options also posted good first quarter volumes, as volatility returned to equity markets.","Our CDS clearing business generated record revenues of $42 million in the quarter as a semiannual roll combined with volatility and demand for credit protection led to a record $4.7 trillion in cleared notional. This strong revenue performance helped expand adjusted segment margins to 68% and generated a 12% increase in adjusted operating income compared to the prior year.","I'll wrap up on slide 8 with some additional color on our volume trends. In our oil business, building on the momentum of a strong first quarter, average daily volume in April was up 7% year-over-year led by continued strength in Gasoil which was up 36% from the prior year. Gasoil continues to benefit from an expanding diesel market, particularly in Europe and Asia. The benchmark is also increasingly being adopted as a proxy for the refined barrel, providing a liquid and efficient tool for hedging a range of related products.","In addition, Brent ADV was up 5% year-over-year in April and open interest once again reached record levels during the period. Year-to-date, Brent volumes are up 3% year-over-year despite realized volatility trending nearly 20% below levels from a year ago.","In our natural gas complex, we continue to see commercials gravitate towards our regional markets while realized volatility levels are at historic lows, suppressing the need for commercial hedging, growth across our basis markets has been strong, with futures open interest up 19% year-to-date which helped drive record open interest levels in our North American natural gas markets.","Strength across our key financial products has also continued into April. In our rates business, sterling volumes were up 16% year-over-year. After a slower start to the month, volumes accelerated, nearly doubling the pace set through the first half of the month. And while Euribor volume growth has been impacted by significant outperformance in March and April of 2017 related to European political uncertainty, participants continued to position their portfolios for dynamic central bank policy in 2018 and beyond whether related to the ECB, the Bank of England or the Fed, individually or collectively. In addition, our FTSE and MSCI equity index ADV was up 7% for the month as volatility levels continue to be elevated versus the prior year, and customer engagement in non-U.S. equity markets continues to grow.","So, to summarize, we delivered a strong quarter and are off and running again in 2018. Mid-single-digit revenue growth alongside strong expense control produced 9% growth in adjusted operating income, early and positive contributions from our recent strategic investment, our capital return priorities, and an improved tax rate further enhanced our earnings growth and yielded a 22% increase in adjusted earnings. And our commitment to executing on our strategic priorities, innovating to serve our customers, and generating positive economic value for our shareholders continues to deliver strong results.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Thank you, Scott, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'll begin on slide 9. We've just highlighted a number of secular trends and our strong execution to capture those trends. Our efforts translated into record adjusted operating income, record adjusted earnings per share, and the strength and diversity of our global markets produced record futures volume that resulted in double-digit revenue growth along with solid growth in our cash equity and options markets. Coupled with strong data and listings performance, we expanded margins, generated solid cash flows, and have returned over a $0.5 billion to shareholders through the end of April.","While we're pleased with this performance, our focus is 100% on future growth opportunities, which means strategically creating more value for our customers and our shareholders. The breadth and depth of each of our business lines uniquely positions us to lead and to innovate across asset classes and workflows for our customers around the world.","We spoke to some of the ways that we're leveraging our global infrastructure at our Investor Day last year. These include our growing index business, our expanding bond platform based on our expertise in supporting markets as they seek automation and technology and our valuable SFTI network. Today this network has evolved well beyond its original capability, as a secure market infrastructure and grown into an expanded platform known as the ICE Global Network which encompasses vast content and connectivity solutions.","So turning to slide 10, I'll update you on our growing range of assets and our progress in the index space. The shift towards indexation and passive investing in equities and fixed income has resulted in active managers demanding more data and richer analytics to better understand their benchmarks and to deconstruct market performance as they search for alpha. At the same time, passive managers are seeking more control and flexibility in terms of how they innovate and differentiate their offering.","Our customers have shaped our approach to this rapidly-expanding market in a unique way, and they've enabled us to distinguish our services based on their evolving needs. So, while we offer traditional index licensing services and fund managers and ETF sponsors can choose to benchmark to our proprietary indexes under a traditional fee model, we've also become a leader in serving the growing demand for self-indexing services.","We're uniquely able to pursue this multi-prong approach, particularly in the fixed income markets because we own the underlying content, as well as the building blocks and the crucial services that go into creating a benchmark.","ICE's historical and real-time pricing data, our reference data and our detailed analytics are all key components of index construction. We offer index selection and calculation services. And for ETF sponsors, we operate the leading ETF listing and trading venue in NYSE Arca. So, we've built an open platform where asset managers and ETF sponsors can tailor solutions to meet their specific needs, allowing for customized benchmarks, to enhance and inform risk management or to assist in future product development. We offer complete flexibility, regardless of what managers choose to consume, whether it's an ICE or NYSE-branded index or services around their self-indexing needs.","And you are seeing the success of this strategy. Over the past few quarters, we've signed self-indexing agreements with some of the major fund sponsors and we have now established index relationships with 11 of the top 13 ETF sponsors. As a sign of this success, our first quarter index revenue increased 20% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. So, while we're still in the early stages of deploying this strategy, we're executing and we're seeing very encouraging signs of traction within a growing addressable market.","I'd like to now move to slide 11. Like a number of the markets that we've helped transform in the past, the fixed income market is held back by many inefficiencies across its trade life cycle and it's a market where buy-side and sell-side are seeking solutions to these issues. Over the past 10 years, dealer inventory levels, which used to be the primary source of fixed income liquidity, declined dramatically. While at the same time the size of the U.S. corporate debt market nearly doubled, the number of fixed income ETFs grew six-fold, and over $1 trillion flowed into fixed income funds in the U.S. alone. And so, with the unwinding of QE policies, market participants are looking for advances in workflow that improve their ability to access information and lower their total cost to transact.","We've been aligning our solutions for this transition for some time. Our pricing and reference data is the foundation of our fixed income business, bringing a rich set of content critical to the fixed income trade workflow. Our decades of pricing expertise along with our technology and innovation has combined to lay the groundwork for further product expansion and enhancement, such as with our reference data offering, real-time pricing, indices, liquidity tools and best execution.","These products are complemented by an analytics platform that sees nearly $3 trillion of customer assets uploaded each day. This enables us to deliver critical scenario analysis, cash flow modeling and factor-based performance attribution. It provides our customers with a unique window into their inventory and potential trading opportunities. And it's all fueled by our data and can be securely delivered over our ICE Global Network.","Our January acquisition of BondPoint brought additional execution technologies and expanded our customer base into underserved markets. BondPoint brought technology such as a click-to-trade protocol that leverages a resting order book, which is similar to our futures and equity markets.","Consistent to what we did in the energy markets, this data and liquidity is bringing more efficiency and activity to the fixed income markets, and we'll soon deliver this over the ICE Global Network tapping into a broader community of market participants.","In its first quarter, as a part of ICE when coupled to our infrastructure, BondPoint saw average daily notional volumes increase 50% year-over-year, a record for the business. We've also seen a steady growth in liquidity as the average number of bids and offers set a record in the first quarter, up 35% year-over-year. And we've seen rising user participation as we invest and help facilitate more efficiency and growth in this space. And so, as a provider of pre-trade, trade, and post-trade solutions, and as the owner of the underlying content that fuels our tools, we're well-positioned for growth in a growing market.","Let me turn to slide 12. The ICE Global Network is a unique offering within the industry. With its roots known as SFTI, its expansion now into the ICE Global Network flexibly serves buy-side and sell-side institutions, data providers, third-party exchanges and clearing houses, traders and market makers. With an unparalleled range of financial market content, including proprietary and third-party data gathered from over 600 unique sources, it serves as a backbone for information flow across global markets.","As the markets become more reliant on consuming and analyzing large data sets to manage portfolios, the quality and integrity of data is crucial to wholesale and retail customers. And so, the ICE Global Network distinguishes us as a true provider of end-to-end flexible workflow solutions that connect participants, markets and critical information.","Let me conclude my remarks on slide 13. These are just a few of the growth opportunities in front of us. And as you can see, our focus is on differentiated products and services that leverage both our vast infrastructure and our innovative culture. We're driving efficiency and new opportunities for our growing customer base around the world and we've been really deliberate and disciplined in our initiatives to differentiate the value to our customers.","We've grown from a small start-up company focused on technology and automation to now a comprehensive provider of risk management solutions across virtually all asset classes around the globe. And with this expansion, the opportunities for our growth have increased, whether it's in data, our commodity and financial markets or how we connect markets to this information. We've never been more focused on driving growth and maximizing the return for all of our stakeholders.","Importantly, I'd like to thank our customers for their business and for their trust. And I want to thank my colleagues for their efforts that contributed to yet another record quarter for ICE.","I'll now turn the call back to our moderator, Jamie, and he'll conduct a question-and-answer session until 9:30 Eastern Time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Rich Repetto from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead with your question.","Richard Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Yeah. Good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Scott.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Good morning.","Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Good morning.","Richard Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","So, I guess the first question is on market data and the 6% organic growth that, right in line with your guidance. I guess, Jeff or Scott, can you talk about is it coming through the buckets that you put out, the different areas of growth that you sort of guided to in the Analyst Day which was 30% I think, pricing and new customers and new products and stuff, but is it coming from those products \u2013 those buckets? And then also, if you look at some of your peers, one peer saw actually a pullback in market data, another saw strong organic growth. I'm just trying to see I would imagine your market data is much more differentiated because of the fixed income and the broader foundation you have. But if you could differentiate, I guess, from your other exchange peers and their data offerings?","Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yeah. Okay. Thanks, Rich. So, first of all, yes, broadly, the revenue growth is coming in the buckets that we indicated. As I said at the Investor Day last summer, it's not every year going to be exactly 30% from pricing and 20% from new products, et cetera, but it's generally coming from those buckets. And you get a number of indicators that can demonstrate that. For example, I mentioned pricing and analytics signings was up 20%. That's all about the 60% of the buckets that are new products, and new customers, and selling our existing customers more.","So, as we're working to give you guys more metrics, we're trying to give you ones that will indicate where that growth is coming from. And again, signings is a good example. Connectivity is another one where capacity is up 14%. Again, that may be the same customer demanding more capacity or new customers driving capacity. So, we're seeing good contribution from all of those new products, new customers, et cetera. And of course, we are getting some contribution from price as well.","And I think all of that leads to not only a good quarter where we delivered the 6% organically, but it builds into an ASV that I mentioned is up organically in constant currency 6.5%. So, I think that's fundamentally what's driving it. I think you're right there seemed to be some issues with some of our peers with regards to their data both sequentially and year-to-year.","We actually had a good quarter in exchange data. As I mentioned on the call, we had a really strong futures exchange data growth of 4%. I think one of the things you're seeing in our results, it's certainly what you mentioned, which is the diversity of products that we have to offer. So, we're not subject to any single market. It's not just about natural gas. It's not just about oil. It's not just about the U.S. or Asia. It's not just about interest rates, we've got a breadth of products. But I really think a key difference for us today versus maybe a year or two ago is the nature of our sales team. With the acquisition of IDC, we acquired a really strong sales team, a really good sales leader. And Tim Noble, who you met at our Investor Day, and Chris Edmonds, who runs our Global Commodity Sales, have really worked hard together on cross-selling. So that when we're out talking to customers about IDC's information (00:24:11) or ICE data services information, to the extent there's an opportunity for energy data or interest rate data, we're able to communicate among the sales teams and go execute on that. So it's breadth of data. It's strength of sales team.","And then the last thing I would say that distinguishes us is we serve a commercial market. And I mentioned the fact that our basis market open interest is up 19% in natural gas. That's because more people are fracking and more people are working on the shale and those types of initiatives. And those commercials are surrounding our market and in order to hedge their risk they need our data. So, I think it's all of that combined that's allowed our overall data business to perform well and underneath that specifically for our futures and exchange data to grow.","Richard Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Got it. And I'll try to make the follow-up quick, it probably won't be. But on the fixed income market, Jeff, you've talked about \u2013 and thanks for the info in what you've done with BondPoint and sort of your platform behind it. I guess, how do you look at the \u2013 overall, you've talked about how distribution is so important. How do you look at it from like an organic or inorganic \u2013 if other platforms that had distribution came available, I would \u2013 just how would you evaluate? I would imagine it would be a good fit with what you're doing, or do you think you're \u2013 you've got the platform and the trading platform combined where you don't have to look at acquisitions?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yeah. I've got a couple thoughts. First is, we're trying to \u2013 the bond market is so big, so global and so analog that there's a lot of touch points for its conversion to digital. One is trading. But as I tried to point out in my prepared remarks, we want to touch the workflow as many places as we can and starting with that data set and the connectivity we have on the ICE Global Network, just helping people with workflow. If we can enhance trading, that would be great, but that's not necessarily our driver. Our driver is where can we touch your workflow, indexation, data, analytics, analysis on the market as a whole, and that's how we're thinking about it.","In terms of M&A, I mean, we have kind of a playbook here that you've witnessed for years. We like to buy very small immature companies that we think, are poised for growth where, when we bolt them onto the infrastructure that we have, we can accelerate their growth. That allows us to pay a premium for those companies knowing that just putting it into our network can accelerate that and deliver value for our shareholders even though we may have to pay a premium to buy the business.","And then, on the other extreme, we buy legacy businesses that have fallen out of favor, that have sort of lost energy. And we go in and slice and dice them and sell off parts, and reconstruct them, and try to reenergize them again and that's worked very well for us. And so, that broadly speaking we sort of look at the two end points of a company's life cycle, and we do well on both of those ends. It's less obvious to us that buying something in the middle, in other words, that's growing and fully priced, that we can make a difference. So, that's why BondPoint was a very good fit for us.","And the fact that it's growing at 50% validated our hope. Similarly buying IDC, which was a very mature company that was growing at 3%, then turning it around now so that we doubled that growth rate validated that point for us.","Richard Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Got it. Thank you very much. Very helpful, Jeff.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. And I'm going to follow up on that question. So, in terms of fixed income, you've talked about the suite of products, like indexes to ETF listings, to data, to analytics. As the market migrates from voice to electronic trading in fixed income, how does the value proposition in data evolve for ICE and IDC, like where does the value proposition go from and where does the value proposition go to? And to connect this to Tradeweb, should that company fall into a competitor's hands, to what extent does that create a threat for ICE's fixed income data business in the long term? Thanks.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Sure. So, if you think about the move from analog to digital in any market, one of the things that will \u2013 or a couple things that will happen will be one, you'll broaden participation because it will be easier to access the market, and you'll likely increase the velocity because there will be an immediacy of your ability to trade in and out of a position. And as you know, there are so many bonds in the world that it's very unlikely that the market will move to a true bid, offer futures-type platform because there are just too many names. And then in each name, you have different tenors. And so, what we think and what we're seeing, and we're all witnessing, is that the more liquid names, the more well-known names, the tenors that are earlier duration if you will and more in favor, tend to be liquid and can trade on a platform.","But then you have all this other inventory around the world that just isn't likely to be able to trade on a two-way bid, offer. It's not going to have price transparency. And so, you're going to need daily marks for those names. And we view that we're going to be the provider of those marks. And as the market broadens, as there are more participants and more interest in the market, as there has been by just some of the data that I read in my prepared remarks, we think there are going to be more customers that want to demand that data.","So, Tradeweb is in the world right now, to answer your specific question. It's owned by a group of people. If it's owned by a different group of people, I'm not sure it changes anything for us. More importantly, we keep investing in the technology to calculate and deliver more and more accurate off-the-run and difficult names that the market is demanding because they've made their ways into portfolios.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. Maybe (00:31:27) a wonky question, but China has launched an oil contract that's gained traction as I think we all expected. And I think in the near term it would seem to be a positive, it creates another arbitrage opportunity, I think as you have discussed in the past.","So, longer term, what does this mean for Brent in the context of a market with potentially two viable oil contracts rather than one? I'm not sure it makes a difference, but that's part of it. And it ultimately begs the question, is there a way for ICE to leverage or better leverage the China opportunity directly or indirectly? You've got a suite of commodity and financial products. Can you do better with China? It seems like a big opportunity. Thanks.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yeah. So, first of all, what's interesting about the China contract that you referenced is that it's a delivery contract. In other words, it's a contract that's priced at the delivery point. That's not the way the benchmarks have worked in oil historically. Brent oil and WTI oil are priced at their source, their production source. And so, the market has sort of grown up with take the benchmark at its production source and then add a basis price to it, which essentially is a transportation and infrastructure price to get the product to its delivery point. So, we obviously trade Brent, and we also have listed a Brent-Dubai basis market and that market is a very active market. We have a competitor that has also a \u2013 or a peer at least that has an exchange in Dubai.","And so, in any event, there is this sort of notion of, okay, here's what the value of oil is in Dubai. That's largely \u2013 now add a transportation and infrastructure component to that price and now you've got the price of oil in China. And so what we see is, as I think you alluded to is that, that China contract is additive to the market. It's one more basis point in a world that is full of basis points. We list over a thousand energy contracts. Most of those are different grades and different delivery points than the benchmark of Brent and WTI. So we think it will be additive. We think it probably will contribute to growth in the benchmark contracts for not just in the short run, but into perpetuity.","The second part of your question was we have a lot of Asian oil and petrochemical and commercial customers that come and do business with us in Europe. They've set up trading desks there. They have infrastructure in Europe. And so similarly to the oil, they've come to the source, if you will, of where the trading is. And so we don't expect that to change because those outposts for those Asian companies that are in Europe are being used to hedge all kinds of business and attract talent that would be difficult to attract on to the mainland.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. Good morning. Jeff, I want to go back to the indexation trend that you've highlighted and totally hear you on the self-indexation, definitely seems like a pretty big opportunity. Can you guys help us think about kind of the yield that ICE could get on a dollar in fixed income AUM that's going self-index, because it definitely feels like that's the market that's going to grow considerably. And then just maybe a reminder in terms of kind of the royalties you guys are getting on the proprietary indices as well.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Sure. Well, our thought process is that the asset management space is getting more and more and more competitive. And the historical model of \u2013 and in doing so, it's getting increasingly concentrated into the hands of larger managers. And those managers are building their own brands.","And in the past, a lot of the brands were the brand names that were on the indices. We have a lot of NYSE-branded indices. I mean, that's an amazing brand. And we were able to charge dollars per AUM in order for people to reference those brands. But as the managers themselves form their own brands, what they're finding and what many of them are finding is they can create their own \u2013 put their own name on their own index, and it has a lot of power in the market, and they can do that at a price much cheaper because they don't have to pay for the third party's brand.","So, what we've done is, as I mentioned, try to create an open platform where we will sell you services on a non-dollar per AUM basis. We have, for example, calculation engines that we can license you under a more traditional software license. We have our own strong brands that we can license you on a dollar per AUM basis. And then, where we've really been working is in the middle, which is let's have some value between the two of us where we recognize the strong brand of the manager, but we also recognize that the data and analytics and index selection and calculation, third-party validation that ICE does also has brand value. And so, let's come up with some lower dollar per AUM or some hybrid model.","We have been very open with you, Alex, and also with our customers that we think we can grow this data market at high to mid-single digits. We think it's going to grow like that for quite a while because of the trends that are in the market. And when we sit across the table and negotiate we basically say to people this is the kind of return that we're looking for if you want to do business with us and we recognize you are going to use your brand to go gather dollars in the form of AUM, and we hope that you can gather them at mid to single \u2013 high-single digits as well, and in which case there's a deal to be made.","And so, that's our strategy. We're not getting greedy. We're trying to work with the managers and it's really been successful. We've really done a very good job, getting 11 out of the 13 top managers onto this platform. And as Scott said, it's helped to drive future contract growth and accelerating our data offering.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's helpful. And then, just a cleanup question for Scott. The slightly lower expense guide for the year, obviously despite FX, is that the additional synergies or just the timing of some of the synergies being pulled forward? Kind of what was the delta versus the prior?","Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","No, it's a good question. We're right on track with regard to the synergies, the $30 million target that we had for this year. Ben, sitting to my left, he and the team are working and will certainly deliver that. We're actually generating some efficiencies in other parts of our business. The two more recent acquisitions, we believe we'll be able to integrate more efficiently than we had originally anticipated. I'll circle you back to where we were coming into the end of the year, one line item I mentioned was that we would have the net of all the M&A and integrated businesses, and FX as about a $15 million expense hurt but covered by over $40 million of revenue and that number has actually come down now. The expense impact is probably going to be only around $10 million, but the revenue is going to be better than $60 million. And again, that's from better integration of the more recently acquired businesses, plus continued efforts at efficiency in our core business.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys. Let me just get back on data, I guess. For the 6% to 7% growth and obviously also the longer-term mid- to high-single digits, can you talk about growth in Europe and your view on that? It looks like \u2013 correct me if I'm wrong, but it looks like the mix of the revenue shifted actually towards the U.S. from Europe quarter-over-quarter. So, I guess, maybe what drove that, if that's correct? And then how are you looking at the MiFID environment and the growth in data customers from Europe versus the rest of your mix? And also, Jeff, you talked about active \u2013 increased data usage from active managers in relation to indices, maybe you could just elaborate on that, what they're actually doing?","Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Sure. Yes. So, look, I think, with regard to the first quarter and frankly for the year, the European revenues continue to do well and continue to contribute strongly, driven, as you said, by the MiFID II which, as we've indicated previously, even though it's now in place, there are a number of customers still scrambling to come into compliance.","And so I think that's not unique to the first quarter. I think it's frankly not even going to be unique to this year. I think it will continue on into 2019 as well. And I think the place you see that even more clearly is if you look at signings. Signings in Europe were up 81% year-over-year. Now, I'm not forecasting that we're going to grow 81% every single quarter, but it is another indication that the sales team and the number of products they have to sell to help customers with MiFID II is really delivering. And so, as the European business will continue to contribute strongly, Asia Pacific continues to emerge and the U.S. just continues to put up solid numbers.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","And on the second point, you may recall last year, we bought the bond evaluation business from S&P. It's is a very good transaction for us and that we were able to combine their evaluations business with our evaluations business and create a stronger offering, and then turn around and give S&P back the results which helped in their ratings, improving their ratings capabilities given that they have better underlying data.","But that same capability, which is just having better and stronger ability to value fixed income products has particularly gotten the interest of the major asset managers. There's been a lot of growth obviously in ETFs over the last few years, particularly in the equity space. And you're seeing that same trend now move over to putting fixed income and other kinds of assets into the ETF design and they're having really good success. It's a real growth area.","And so, in the bond area, we acquired the Bank of America Merrill Lynch bond index portfolio, thousands of indices. So, we have a standard, well-known, well-respected licensing platform that we can use. But we also have all this underlying data, and the ability, and the expertise with a lot of quantitative people that can actually help a manager design an index and figure out how to have an index that will not only be attractive but will be operable in terms of being able to do substitutions and provide end-of-day valuations. And so, that business has done particularly well and, as I mentioned, is attracting a lot of the top managers who are focusing on the non-equity ETF space right now.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just a question on RPC in energy. Obviously, that's improved nicely into the end of the year, and then it looks like it took a dive in the first quarter but now is back up in April again. So, maybe if you can just talk about what were the drivers? It looks like it's not really mix shift, so I don't know if there's anything else going on underneath there?","Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yeah. Look. I think as you go through some of the more volatile period that you saw in the first quarter that tends to have a bit of downward pressure on the RPC. But again, whether you look at first quarter or April or last year or any given quarter, we're relatively consistent. For energy, I think we're $1.37 in April. You go back and look over time, we've been somewhere between $1.33 and $1.42. So plus or minus a couple cents each year. And I think that's one of the reasons why despite one of our peers where you see the RPC drop off as volumes grow, we are able to maintain volume growth, maintain open interest growth and, most importantly, because it's where the bottom line is made, we're able to maintain our revenue share, which we have consistently done regardless of volumes, and that's through the management of RPC.","You're right. I don't think there's a particularly large mix impact in April, although we certainly benefited from Brent being strong and nat gas volumes were down, and that's lower RPC. But I think, generally speaking, it's just us paying attention to the rates. It's us being a more commercial market and not needing to pay for trade flow. And those are the things that have allowed us to be stable.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So, is RPC more in line with sort of the most recent trend rather than sort of the sub \u2013 lower first quarter for the rest of the year aside from mix?","Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","I'm not sure I heard your question well.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","No. Just in thinking about RPC trend in energy, would we look at April as a better \u2013 April and the fourth quarter of last year as sort of a better guide for the rest of 2018...?","Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yeah. Look, again, plus or minus a couple of pennies in any month or any quarter based on volatility, market participation and products, it could move around. But, yeah, I think again, you look over the last 8, 10, 12 quarters, we're around that $1.37 plus or minus a little bit almost every month and every quarter.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Okay. Thank you. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt from KBW. Please go ahead with your question.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Good morning.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Just on the strong other income of $19 million in the quarter, I think you called out $15 million that was a Euroclear dividend. I'm guessing the remaining $4 million or $5 million was MERS and the dividend from OCC. And you called out MERS in your prepared remarks as you're rolling out this new digital infrastructure and investing that business this year. Just wondering if you'd give us some more color on the progress for that business and whether or not we could see more substantial growth in that equity income line from MERS specifically or maybe some step function type growth as the new platform is fully rolled out. Thank you.","Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yeah. Let me start quickly with the wonky and (00:46:43) then I'll hand it to Jeff to talk about the MERS strategy that we're excited about. So, in other income, you're right, we had the $15 million dividend. In that line there are always a bunch of stuff moving around. But just for the rest of the year, there are three things that matter; OCC dividend, the MERS contribution that we take, and the impact of pension expense which moved down into other income this year.","And so, as you kind of think about the out quarter, $6 million to $8 million in other income is going to be about the right range. That's $8 million to $10 million from OCC and MERS and a negative $2 million from pension. So, obviously, we gave you that from a model standpoint. We definitely got a good contribution from MERS in the first quarter, and I'll let Jeff talk to you about where we're headed with that.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Sure. So the progress we've made is that we've built essentially an all-new infrastructure for MERS. That infrastructure is running in parallel with the legacy system. And we are now in the process of opening up the new system, if you will, for market participants. There are hundreds of people in the mortgage space that have digital platforms that need to hook to MERS. So it will take some time for the market to spill over into the new platform. But we are deeply engaged with the market participants, particularly major market participants. And we would expect that they, over the summer and into the third quarter, will start to rebuild their systems and connect to the new MERS.","That's an \u2013 the reason I get into that level of detail, that's an important point because once that infrastructure is all in place, people who are dealing in mortgages will now have a much more robust platform that they can start to change their own workflows and move much more towards a digital mortgage.","Some of the early adopters in the space have been engaged with us for quite some time, trying to figure out how they can improve their own internal workflows and engage with MERS. It will be \u2013 it's hard for us to gauge specifically how quickly they'll be able to adopt digital mortgages, but it's definitely coming. It's definitely a trend \u2013 a macro trend that that has the engagement of the industry because, right now, in the U.S., it's a very, very clumsy market.","At the end of the day, mortgages get registered usually locally with some kind of registrar. There are thousands and thousands of jurisdictions that deal with mortgages at the local level. So, it will take a lot of time for local jurisdictions to start to think about digital records and not boxes of paper. But the goal is to try to digitize as much of the workflow, the upstream, the actual homeowner participation, sit in your kitchen, be able to read your mortgage on a screen, be able to click with your signature, and keep all of that underwriting process as digital as possible until we get to the last recordation, in which case it may have to become paper and handed to a registrar. But that's the vision if you will. And we're well on track to deliver our part of it. So, we expect growth, and we've been pleasantly surprised that there's been early adopters that have helped, driven strong results for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Carrier from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, guys. Jeff, maybe first one, just we saw a big kind of improvement in the CDS or the credit business this quarter. And it seems like cyclically we should see maybe more of that. But just wanted to get your guys' sense on is there enough clarity on sort of the regulatory backdrop and how that market's working now versus maybe the past couple of years where we could see more traction just given kind of the changing dynamics in the market?","Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yeah. It's a good question. That business has been on a steady march up since we opened it, and it continued in the first quarter this year. And I think the thing that's probably been the most encouraging over the last four to five quarters, maybe even a little longer than that is that need for a regulatory push into clearing doesn't exist anymore. Customers are coming because they see the efficacy of clearing.","And so, when you see a big quarter like the first quarter, where you've got a lot of people looking to cover their credit exposure, you see big notional come into clearing. And the reason it drives the revenues the way it did is because it's not those nine guys that helped us start the clearinghouse back in 2008. It is the buy-side firms. It is the other smaller financial institutions that want that protection, that want to see it cleared in order to have the confidence in their risk management.","So, I'm very pleased with how that business has trended. Clearly, it helped that the first quarter was a roll month. So, I don't expect it repeats in the second quarter, but in the third quarter, around another roll, I suspect it will be really solid again. This year, I think we'll continue the trend of that business growing 10% plus or minus a little bit. So, the market dynamics are very good. Customers have seen the efficacy of the clearing model, and the regulatory push isn't really needed anymore for us to grow that business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Hung from Autonomous. Please go ahead with your question.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Hi. So, what do you think is your key challenge in claiming more market share of fixed income ETF AUM? And I'd be particularly interested in your thoughts on competition around what you're seeing from the large players like Bloomberg in market (00:52:44) because I recall one of the benefits of Bloomberg's acquisition of the Barclays business for you was the customer preferred the index calculated by IDC data and so then they shifted for the ICE Treasury bond index?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yes. So, we have, as you pointed out, Vincent, we have competitors in that space, but we're all a little bit unique. And honestly, many of the major managers want to see everybody's information. There's this thirst for information right now that people are consuming as much of it as they can get. So, I'm not sure a lot of our customers necessarily are thinking of us as competitors. They're just thinking of us as a bunch of complementary data providers that can give them the ultimate vision, if you will.","But we've done a really good job of establishing our own brand, if you will. IDC was well known, as you mentioned. The Bank of America Merrill Lynch indices were well known. And putting that together under the ICE banner and getting it onto our network has strengthened both of them, and we are a highly viable competitor.","We also have very close relationships with a lot of the large managers. We touch them in many, many ways including on ETFs, as you mentioned, in our listings venue. So, we know the people there, we are deeply engaged at many levels of these organizations so that we can talk about their challenges and our opportunities, and that seems to be helping. If you add that index business that you're talking about to the fact that we are working on a complete workflow solution, to plug into these companies and help them at the multiple touch points that they need in the front, middle and back office, help them with regulatory compliance, with MiFID issues and what have you. All of that organically is helping to drive our indices into these organizations and is contributing to that nice, steady, we think, long-term growth that we're going to continue to get from that business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Herbert from Citi. Please go ahead with your question.","Ben Herbert - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to go to the capital return and just how you're maybe thinking about the buyback discussions with the board, just given it was authorized pre tax reform? And then maybe against that, just your capacity on M&A?","Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yeah. So, let's start with the buyback. So, we consistently, obviously, talk with our board about our strategy. And as we go in with them, we're typically talking about best use of capital. And one of the things we do with that is we look at kind of where do the analysts think our price should be, how are we priced relative to the market, and then we've got our own internal model of where we're priced.","And right now, frankly, it's a pretty easy discussion with the board that says yeah, go spend every dollar you generate that you don't need for internal investment in M&A on buyback because that's the best return on investment. And you're seeing it. I mean, $400 million, we told you we did $100 million in January. We told you we did $400 million through April. So, you can kind of see the trend. If you run rate that out and add the dividend on top of it, you'll know that it's going to be the most significant capital that we have returned largely in buybacks because that's where we think it makes the most sense.","Having said that, the important second question you asked is capacity for M&A. And the good news is we're where we need to be from a leverage standpoint. We're generating really solid cash flows, and we've been able to execute some strategic transactions without dialing back on the buybacks. We did the BondPoint deal and we still bought back shares. We made the investment in Euroclear and we still bought back shares.","And so, with the cash generative ability of our company right now, we're not having to pick either or. There will certainly come a time with the right deal at the right moment where we can generate the right return, where we may have to make tradeoffs, but that's not where we are right now. And it's certainly not where we are in terms of allowing us to return over $0.5 billion through April.","Operator","And our next question comes from Chris Harris from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. I wanted to ask you guys a follow-up question on the Shanghai Brent contract. You guys rightly point out that the introduction of this definitely creates a new opportunity for traders to go back and forth between your market and China. But how should we be thinking about your commercial customers that are based in Asia? Might this contract lead some of those customers to maybe switch over to the Asian-based contracts or not? Just how should we be thinking about that?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Sure. Well, I mean, if you're an Asian customer that wants delivery of oil in Asia, you have an opportunity to buy that contract. But if you're the producer of the oil, you're probably in the Middle East or in the North Sea or in the United States and you've got to figure out how to hedge that, not only the production but then the transportation and infrastructure to get it into China.","And so, remember there's two sides of every trade and what we're seeing is commercial customers that want to service China coming in to these traditional benchmarks and basis contracts and increasing volume. So, I don't expect that this displaces anything. It's kind of a new basis contract of which we have hundreds in the market right now. It's an important one because it represents China, a growing economy. But there are lots of important basis markets in the world and the underlying benchmarks which we happen to trade both of the big oil benchmarks, we'll continue to do well against growth in those basis markets.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, at this time, and reaching the end of the allotted time for today's question-and-answer session, I'd like to turn the conference call back over to management for any closing remarks.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Well, thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you in August and that's when we'll report results for the current quarter. Have a good morning.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for attending today's presentation.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kelly Loeffler. Ms. Loeffler, please go ahead.","Kelly L. Loeffler","Good morning. ICE's fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investor section of the theice.com. These items will be archived, and our call will be available for replay.","Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2014 Form 10-K, which we filed this morning.","In addition to GAAP results, we also refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including adjusted income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted expenses and adjusted EPS. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the GAAP term in the earnings materials, an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful and how management uses these measures. When used on the call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction base expenses. Adjusted net income refers to adjusted income from continuing operations, and adjusted EPS refers to adjusted diluted continuing operations earnings per share.","With us on the call are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Chuck Vice, President and Chief Operating Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Scott.","Scott A. Hill","Thank you, Kelly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. I'll begin on Slide 4, which highlights our 2014 performance.","During 2014, we achieved our ninth consecutive year of record revenues and adjusted earnings. While volume declined 16% over the prior year, net revenues grew 3% on a pro forma basis to $3.1 billion, thanks to growth and trading and listings revenues at the New York Stock Exchange, as well as growth in data services and CDS clearing. In addition, we achieved over 50% of our synergy target by the end of 2014, and adjusted operating margin expanded to 55%. This combination of revenue growth and margin expansion enabled ICE to deliver 15% adjusted earnings growth in 2014 and helped us generate operating cash flows of $1.5 billion, more than double 2013. These record earnings and cash flows combined with the IPO of Euronext enabled us to significantly reduce our leverage, return nearly $1 billion of capital to the shareholders and invest over $0.5 billion in strategic acquisitions.","Now let's turn to Slide 5, where I'll briefly highlight our fourth quarter results. Adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter rose 30% to $2.59 per share. Net revenues grew 10% on a pro forma basis to $800 million, including record data services revenues, strong CDS clearing revenues and double-digit growth from our NYSE trading and listings business.","Adjusted expenses of $340 million came in below guidance as we continued to realize synergies on an accelerated basis, and adjusted operating margin was 58%.","Currency impacts, which are part of running the global business, were negligible, as most of our revenues, and particularly those where we are growing, are dollar denominated. Our tax rate for the quarter on an adjusted basis was 32%, which reflects a larger U.S. profit mix and a few year-end cleanup items that impacted the quarter. As you'll see in our guidance provided in the appendix, we expect the shift to more U.S. profit to result in a 2015 tax rate of 28% to 31%.","Let's move to Slide 6, where I'll detail fourth quarter revenues and expenses. On the left side, you can see that net transaction and clearing revenues totaled $479 million. Data services revenues reached a record $174 million, including contribution from SuperDerivatives and ICE Benchmark Administration. Our listings revenue generated a record $95 million, which was up 9% compared to the prior fourth quarter on a pro forma basis. Our U.S. cash and equities options business grew 14% on a pro forma basis to $95 million.","Other revenue contributed $52 million in the quarter. You will notice of that we have made changes to the way we report our data listings and other revenues. We have moved data delivery services into the Data Services revenue line, and corporate governance services into the Listings revenue line. We believe these changes provide much greater transparency regarding services closely associated with our data and listings offerings.","The current and prior year have been updated to reflect these changes, and additional information is provided in our 10-K.","The right side of Slide 6 shows our expense details. Fourth quarter adjusted expenses were $340 million. Compensation and professional services expense each came in lower as we continue to realize the benefits of our integration plans and from our focus on reducing the outside legacy use of contractors and consultants at the NYSE. We also saw some benefit in the fourth quarter from completing the Liffe transition in November and a year-to-date true-up of in FINRA regulation fees.","Next, on Slide 7. I'll detail our fourth quarter derivatives performance. Total futures and options revenue was $335 million. While volume declined 11% during the quarter, total revenues grew 7% on a pro forma basis, with Brent revenues up 31%, and natural gas revenues up 5%. The overall revenue growth was enabled by the diversity of our product offering and improved revenue capture across all categories: energy, ags and financials. And importantly, strong trends in open interest continue to cross Brent, other oil, equity derivatives and our non-Euribor rates products through year-end. Brent open interest rose 50% year-to-year to a record 3.8 million contracts. Other oil open interest grew 23% year-to-year.","Our non-Euribor interest rate open interest grew 27%, and equity derivatives open interest was up 8% over the prior fourth quarter.","Finally, as noted in our January volume release yesterday, volumes across many of our asset classes are solid. We reported monthly ADV records for total energy, Brent and U.K. nat gas futures, as well as WTI options. Our Brent ADV grew 42% due to continued oil price volatility, and we established another OI record at 4.3 million contracts.","Other oil volume, which includes WTI, heating oil and RBOB, grew 51% over the prior January. While natural gas ADV was down against the difficult compare, January was the second highest volume performance in the past 10 months. Most importantly, we estimate that January revenues increased versus last year. A strength from data and listings revenue, along with growth in commodity and U.K. rates volume, helped mitigate the impact of Continental European interest rate volume declines.","Moving now to Slide 8, I'll walk through our record quarter and OTC clearing. CDS revenues for the year were a record $97 million, an increase of 23% year-over-year. We added several new products, including the Markit iTraxx Senior Financial index and new sovereign instruments. 2014 buyside activity increased 90%, and clearing of European instruments at our U.S. clearinghouse, ICE Clear Credit, rose 124%. In fact, 40% of the $7 trillion of buyside growth notional cleared in 2014 came from European buyside customers clearing through our U.S. CDS clearinghouse.","To continue to serve the growing demand we are seeing from European clients given the uncertain European regulatory landscape, we have now expanded the hours of operation in our U.S. clearinghouse to open at 3 a.m. Eastern Time. We believe the breadth of products that we uniquely offer and the capital efficiency that we provide via our portfolio margin and capabilities will continue to attract global CDS customers to our U.S. clearinghouse.","Slide 9 reflects the strong performance of the New York Stock Exchange. We generated cash trading revenue of $188 million in 2014, an increase of 6% compared to the previous year on a pro forma basis. And importantly, our market share has notably strengthened and our revenue capture has increased. In addition, we continue to work to enhance the efficiency of our equities trading business by rationalizing the 5 technology platforms on which our exchanges operate. I'll also note that NYSE's trading volume was up 19% year-to-year in January.","The lower left chart at the bottom of Slide 9 reflects the New York Stock Exchange's fourth year of leadership in global listings. For 2014, we had a record 129 IPOs, and we led in technology IPOs through the third consecutive year. In aggregate, our customers raised $183 billion in total global proceeds on the New York Stock Exchange, which is more than the next 2 exchanges combined. The NYSE's hybrid market model and transparent IPO platform continue to attract global companies of all sizes and industries. Across data, listings and trading, the New York Stock Exchange is growing and proving its operational efficiency in generating significant cash.","I'll walk through expense synergies on Slide 10. On this slide, you can see an updated time line on expense synergy realization. We realized nearly $290 million or well over 50% of our targeted synergies as of the end of 2014. This was largely due to the seamless integration of our 2 companies, the divestiture of noncore businesses and an accelerated reduction of contractors and outsourced services during the fourth quarter. In 2015, we expect to realize another $110 million to $115 million in synergies as a result of the completion of the Liffe transition and continued efforts to complete the integration of NYSE corporate operations.","We expect to enter 2016 on a run rate at or in excess of $450 million in synergies, and we have a clear path to achieve the total $550 million of synergies entering 2017 as we deploy the NYSE technology platform and finalize the consolidation of our real estate footprint.","Our expense guidance at the top of Slide 10 reflects the 2015 incremental $110 million to $115 million in synergies offset by roughly $20 million to $25 million in investments in the core business. In addition to reducing our existing expense base by roughly $90 million, we will add $40 million to $45 million in expenses related to our recent acquisitions. These expenses will be more than offset by incremental revenues of $50 million to $55 million. We have provided additional guidance in the appendix of this presentation.","I'll wrap up my remarks on Slide 11 with an update on our strong cash flows and capital structure. Operating cash flows grew to a record $1.5 billion in 2014. At December 31, we had over $650 million in net unrestricted cash and short-term investments. Total net debt was $3.2 billion, and our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA was 1.7x. We used our strong cash generation during 2014 to reduce our debt by nearly $2 billion for strategic growth investments and to return nearly $1 billion to shareholders, including roughly $300 million in dividends and over $640 million in share repurchases. Our share repurchases continued in January. And this morning, we announced the first quarter dividend of $0.65 per share.","Uniquely in our sector, we have consistently presented our return on invested capital alongside our earnings and cash measures, because we believe it is an important indicator of value creation. As we averaged in the full impact of the NYSE acquisition during 2014, our ROIC reached its nadir at 6.5%. We are committed to generating revenue growth in a lower expense base to increase our ROIC above our cost of capital by 2016 and then to more traditional levels over time.","2014 was a year of integration during which we accelerated the pace of synergy realization, grew earnings double digits, generated record operating cash flows and advanced our growth initiatives. That momentum will carry over into 2015 as we generate $100 million in incremental organic revenue solely from our data and listings offerings, even while we reduced our expense base by approximately $90 million, excluding acquisitions. That, together with the incremental profits we will generate on investments in our strategic acquisitions, auspicious January revenues and our vigilant focus on the needs of our customers in an evolving regulatory environment, gives us confidence that we will once again generate double-digit earnings growth and strong returns for our shareholders during 2015.","I'll be happy to answer any questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll hand the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Thank you, Scott, and good morning to everybody on the call. We're pleased to report these strong results today, which are what we've committed to do as a growth company.","Our earnings growth in the fourth quarter and for all of 2014 outperformed that of the S&P 500. This demonstrates how we've evolved our business to ensure that we remain levered to long-term growth trends. We are well diversified, and we continue to invest for futures earnings growth by serving our global customers through clearing, capital raising, liquid markets and data services. We've done this alongside the aggressive operating objectives to grow and integrate, to drive value for our customers and our shareholders.","On Slide 12, you can see that we achieved our strategic objectives for 2014. This was an ambitious set of initiatives that required significant resources and organizational change. For example, our teams across technology, regulation, sales and operations worked with the industry over the last year to transition the Liffe exchange to ICE Futures Europe. This milestone allowed us to streamline our markets and get closer to new customers. And we immediately began building out our capabilities in our new complex of Liffe futures markets across rates, soft commodities and equity derivatives.","Moving now to Slide 13. We've laid out 5 of the areas that we believe will enable us to again deliver double-digit earnings growth in 2015. We have a strong track record of improving the performance of acquired businesses, as you can see in our results today. We curated businesses acquired from NYSE by shedding low margin parts of their technology division while strengthening their core listings, trading and data operations. This means that we expect to realize both efficiencies and revenue opportunities, enabling us to grow through a range of trading volume environments.","Our opportunities set spans a number of high-quality areas, ranging from a significant lowering of our expense base, to upside in our markets for energy, agriculture and financials. That, alongside our growing and predictable listings and data services businesses, creates meaningful earnings growth opportunities over the near and long term.","I also want to note some areas that are impacting our customers which primarily relate to ongoing regulatory reform. Where our customers face challenges, we see opportunities to help them meet their regulatory requirements in an innovative and capital-efficient manner. An example of this was our response to the need for swaps clearing in the credit markets during the financial crisis. This is now nearly a $100 million a year business for us.","The paths of global regulatory reform are diverging, and this continues to reinforce our model. In 2009, under the IOSCO framework, countries agreed to implement consistent regulations that would prevent regulatory arbitrage and address those imbalances in regulation that contributed to the financial crisis. 5 years later, for example, there still remains a divergence between the U.S. and Europe. This is why our customers are telling us that the ability and capability of jurisdictional options for trading and clearing is increasingly important, and why you've seen ICE, as well as other major exchange and clearing groups, investing in multiple regions. And as Scott highlighted in his remarks, right now, cleared swaps positions are migrating from Europe to the U.S. I believe that Asia will be the next clearing magnet. And alongside with ICE Clear Singapore, you're seeing the other major exchange groups following us in that direction.","The impacts of increasing regulatory constraints with Dodd-Frank, EMIR, Basel and bank capital rules, paired with the economic challenges of the Eurozone, create uncertainty that drive the need to hedge. And you could see that in our foreign exchange markets during the month of January, where volume was up 93%.","I'd now like to provide more detail on a few of ICE's 2015 growth initiatives beginning on Slide 14. First, our leading crude oil markets. The ICE Brent contract recorded its 18th consecutive year of record futures and options volume. When we acquired the International Petroleum Exchange in year 2001, we had an approximate 30% market share in global crude oil futures trading. Today, we've grown market share to 54%, and we've accomplished this despite aggressive payments for trading volume being made by competitors.","In the fourth quarter, ICE Brent's open interest surpassed that of NYMEX's WTI for the first time in the contract's 27-year history. Our oil markets continue to benefit from strong, long-term secular trends towards hedging and risk management, which have overwhelmed the cyclical headwinds year-after-year. And the moves in the price of crude in recent months again demonstrate the central role that our markets help manage price risk, whether prices are rising or are falling.","Based on the forward price curve for December 2015 delivery, Brent futures prices are over 15% above today's prompt month prices. However, there are still many in the market today that believe oil prices could decline by this same percentage. These divergent views suggest that the only consensus is an expectation that crude prices will remain volatile.","And there are number of factors that point to Brent's ability to continue its long-term growth trend. First, open interest is at record levels and rising. Continued economic and geopolitical uncertainty is causing global participants to continuously reside -- revise their oil price expectations. And secular trends towards hedging, including ICE's broad range of 400-related oil contracts, position us for continued leadership in the global energy markets.","In January, Brent volume was up 42% year-over-year and our Brent options business continued its growth, in fact, just yesterday, setting another volume record. Our Brent open interest reached a new record, up 10% from the end of December. And finally, we completed the transition of the distillate market to our new gas oil specification in January, providing a greater range of hedging opportunity for more market participants. In January, our gas oil daily volume increased 9% year-over-year.","Moving on to Slide 15. I'll provide more detail on our global natural gas trading and clearing activities which, in 2014, comprised about 6% of our total revenues. When we acquired the Endex exchange in 2013, we anticipated the move toward more exchange trading and clearing of European natural gas products. This has, in fact, materialized, as shown in the revenue chart on the right side of the slide. Our natural gas revenue increased 5% during the fourth quarter of 2014 as a result of the rising demand for exchange trading and clearing in European markets. We continue to launch new products and now cover natural gas markets in 4 countries in Europe, with more to come in 2015. Our North American natural gas markets have a strong base of participants, and we recently announced 6 new products there. There's increasing work in Congress this year on the potential for more exports of U.S. natural gas in the form of LNG and could be as soon as late 2015. So we continue to position ourselves for the globalization of the natural gas markets.","Moving now to Slide 16. I'll update you on our European rates complex. The near 0 interest rate levels in the Eurozone impacted the volatility and volume of our Euribor contract, particularly in the second half of the year. The acquisition of its flagship contract, which accounted for only about 4% of our 2014 revenue, however, has facilitated our rapid expansion into broader areas of interest rate trading and clearing.","We continue to grow our U.K. interest rate complex, including short Sterling, where daily volume grew 10% and open interest rose 34% during 2014. Similarly, volume for our U.K. Gilt contract increased 30%, and open interest increased 10% over the prior year.","So on Slide 17, you can see how we're leveraging our leading European interest rate position to build out a broad complex for risk management. Last spring, we introduced 20 new futures contracts, which enable us to cover more durations and more geographies. Our products and services in the interest rate space continue to evolve as we introduced customer-driven solutions during this dynamic monetary policy landscape, and we hold a strong position to serve these markets as expectation for rates moves merry -- vary, excuse me.","Moving to Slide 18. I'll provide more details on our comprehensive data services business. By combining ICE's data business with the data business that we acquired and reorganized from NYSE, Liffe and SuperDerivatives, we've increased the markets that we cover. Together with our organic expansion in the provision of regulated benchmarks with ICE Benchmark Administration, we're building a powerful financial information footprint that leverages the strength of our markets, customer distribution and technology.","In the fourth quarter, 40% of ICE's revenues were generally recurring, as you saw on Slide 6. This is up from just 11% in 2011. As the demand for high quality, low-cost data services rises, we're well-positioned to grow alongside of this macro trend. ICE Benchmark Administration, which launched 1 year ago today with the supervision of LIBOR. More recently, ICE Benchmark Administration took over the management of the ISDAFIX benchmark. And in March, we'll begin establishing the gold price. We're investing the redesign and retool of these global benchmarks, which have trillions of dollars of assets tied to them. And we're working with the industry to develop technology-driven processes to strengthen the confidence and transparency of a growing range of flagship benchmarks, upon which businesses and consumers can rely.","Our recent SuperDerivatives acquisition was particularly strategic. It not only provided us with a rich set of OTC data and analytics, but brought to us a specialized data team that strengthens our competencies for clearing complex financial products.","The SuperDerivatives desktop affords us a unique platform for growth, given the already widely accepted WebICE platform, on which our markets are delivered each day. Couple this with the thousands of companies that we touch for trading, clearing and listings, and you have a powerful and deep customer base for those that we are trying to tailor our new data services.","I'll finish my prepared remarks on Slide 19, with the chart that reflects the results of our team. By bringing innovative solutions to the challenges faced by our industry, ICE has consistently delivered growth in earnings, regardless of the business cycle, for every year that we've been a public company. Long-term ICE shareholders and employees have benefited from the 19% compound annual growth in earnings that our vision and execution have delivered. Today, we operate 11 exchanges, our global data services business, the preeminent equity listings franchise and 6 clearinghouses with our 7th clearinghouse launching later this year. This footprint provides us with flexibility when considering our customer's global needs, as is illustrated by the way that we've been able to respond to clearing business moving from Europe due to regulatory differences and potential clearing capital increases there. We reacted by simply altering our strategic investments in our established global outpost. This validates our flexible global model and informs us on how we approach 2015 and beyond.","I also want to note the strong progress at the NYSE, the flagship exchange for raising global capital and equity trading. For example, last week, we hosted Shake Shack for their very successful IPO. As an entrepreneur, I know firsthand that these are seminal moments for individuals and companies. This is why we continue to work on market structure reform to improve the environment for capital markets growth on behalf of companies and their investors.","And importantly, for ICE's investors, we're proud to highlight the strong contribution that this business is now delivering as a result of our efforts to create efficiencies and optimize areas that continue to have strong potential while generating meaningful U.S.-based cash flow.","We have significant strategic and operational accomplishments in 2014, completing 4 acquisitions, returning nearly $1 billion to our shareholders, reducing nearly $2 billion in net debt and realizing expense synergies on an aggressive time line. But we're not finished, and we have many work streams underway to continue the evolution of our business. We're in an unparalleled position to meet the rising demand for capital-efficient risk management, capital raising, data distribution and new product development around the world.","On behalf of everyone at ICE, I'd like to thank our customers for trusting us with their business and for collaborating with us on their evolving requirements during a very dynamic time.","I'll now ask our operator, Keith, to conduct the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I guess, Jeff, I got to congratulate you. Last time, when -- last quarter's call, oil was going through -- crude oil was going through $80 and we talked about whether that was good or bad and you emphasized the volatility side and it's certainly playing out in volumes now. But I guess I'll update the question. As oil, it's highly volatile, but it's now at $50, and I know you spent a fair amount in the prepared remarks, but does that -- the question continues to come up, does a low oil price, is it going to dampen hedging demand? Or is it offset by the volatility you've spoken about last quarter?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Thanks for the question, Rich. I believe that we're going to go through a really volatile time here based on talking to our customers, particularly many of the drilling and integrated oil firms trying to figure out the dynamic for the next few years. So we see a strong volatility ahead which should drive volume growth. I think underpinning your question is a concern that price in U.S. natural gas has been at historically low levels and volumes on ICE are reduced in the U.S., and I think people sort of somehow try to correlate that. But what many don't recognize is that the U.S. natural gas business is really a regulated business where the end product, natural gas, goes through local distribution companies that are regulated or electric utilities to make electric power, which are regulated, and have the ability to pass through costs, in many cases, to their customers. And therefore, only hedged when there is extreme volatility and work with their Public Utility Commissions to come up with a program that they know that can be passed through. That is very different than the oil industry, where oil products become petroleum fuels, chemicals, other things that go into the free market. And therefore, the supply chain all along there has gotten used to hedging. And in fact, we continue to see increased hedging activity to the point that Scott Hill and I have been meeting with senior managements of consumer-driven firms that here before hadn't hedged and actually, even at the senior level, want to talk about how to do that. So we see great differences between the oil business and the natural gas business, which I think caused us some of that concern.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Got it. Understood. The volumes have been certainly super strong here to date this year. I guess, and my one follow-up, and this would be more for Scott, I guess. You're guiding to significant growth in data services and listing revenue. And could you be, I guess, or could you quantify the contribution from benchmark, ICE Benchmark Administration, Scott? Because that -- is that the significant driver here?","Scott A. Hill","No, Rich. It is a significant driver, but it's not the significant driver. If you look across the data business, it's really a multitude of factors that's driving it. It's more customers, it's us continuing to add different products and different information that our customers want to buy, to package that information up in a way that creates more value for those customers, value that they're willing to pay us for. The ICE Benchmark is clearly a part of it and is embedded in that $100 million increase. And then on top of that, the $50 million or $55 million I talked about from acquisitions, the large part of that, in fact, the vast majority of that is SuperDerivatives. So if you look at our data line, there are any number of growth avenues that are embedded in that. And it's one of the reasons why we went ahead and put the guidance out there because we're very confident that with the additional customers, the growth in ICE Benchmark, the contribution from SuperDerivatives, that particular revenue line is going to generate significant growth for us this year.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","And the $100 million I thought excluded SuperDerivatives. And maybe the question is what percentage of the $100 million growth in that line comes from -- will come from, ballpark, from ICE Benchmark?","Scott A. Hill","Yes. Again, I'm not going to get into the specifics on ICE Benchmark, Rich. But to be clear, the $100 million is organic, and then on top of that is the $50 million to $55 million from the acquisitions.","Operator","And the next question comes from Chris Onwugbolu with Credit Suisse.","Chinedu Christian Onwugbolu - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So my question is on regulation. On capital requirement, I do appreciate it's difficult to quantify since all the rules are not clear. But it will be useful to get maybe a ballpark estimate in terms of how you think about requirements with things like EMIR compliance, possible skin in the game as we look into 2015 cash uses.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","This is Jeff. Let me first take the high-level answer and then -- and layout sort of our thinking on it, then Scott can give you the details and clean up my answer, frankly. But there are 2 -- you mentioned EMIR. And what's happening in the market is there are 2 clearing models that seem to be evolving. There's a clearing model that EMIR legislation is driving towards in Europe, which is a different model than the model that will exist everywhere else in the world. And those models had -- are ultimately are going to result in 2 different choices for customers and 2 different capital strategies. Starting with Europe, Europe is moving towards more open access to clearinghouses and towards a model that used to exist where capital was provided by a group of banks that largely were intermediaries in transactions that we're happy to provide their balance sheet to their customers because they were monetizing the bid offer spread in other ways of serving their customers. So balance sheet went into these utility-oriented clearinghouses. The EMIR legislation is on a collision course with the implementation of Basel rules and other bank capital rules around the world, and we don't believe that those bank balance sheets are going to be available in the way they were in the past. That then suggests -- and frankly, the banks are becoming increasingly more an agency model, not capturing the bid offer spread as their proprietary business is, due to regulatory reasons, shed. So that means that capital in those clearinghouses are going to have to come from 1 of 2 places, either the owner of the clearinghouse or the end-user. As an owner of those kinds of utility clearinghouses, ICE shareholders are not going to put capital at risk for business that is brought by competitors. And our competitors are not going to put capital at risk for business that is brought by ICE. Shareholders are not going to co-mingle their capital bases to help competitors, which means that, ultimately, the capital in Europe is going to largely come from the end-users. Now Europe recognizes this and has provided under EMIR for more segregated accounts. That means that an end-user will be asked to basically put money in a segregated account which will back their positions. And as they do that, what we're going to find is that the large institutional fund managers are not going to be able to mutualize their individual funds with other manager's funds. So we will be putting into place positions where fund managers will have to capitalize, significantly capitalize individual accounts in order to be able to trade. Europe believes that, that's a good idea and that there will be more choice in how to trade. And I guess that they believe that end-users are willing to pay a lot more for that privilege. Outside of Europe, you have the same dynamic with the banks. We all relied on bank balance sheets for many, many years, but those balance sheets are also becoming constrained. And so what you've seen is ICE and our competitors have put more skin in the game. We have -- ICE really started this when we built our first clearinghouse in 2007, when we put money in the default fund that sits in front of the default fund. And when you go through the mechanics of bank capital charges, what you'll find is that if we sit in front of them, we dramatically reduce the charges that they have to take to contribute. And so what you've seen is, over time, ICE has increased capital going into our clearinghouses and many of our competitors have, too, and it's put relief in the system for bank balance sheets. I suspect that, that is not over. We haven't fully seen the impact of all of the bank capital rules. Banks right now are going through another round of internal analysis as they have more clarity in the rules and then, clearly, you're going to have 2017 come into effect. So outside of Europe, what we've seen is, frankly, we offer segregation in Europe right now. And what we have seen and what we have highlighted on the charts here is that our European customers don't really want to put that capital up and have preferred to move their positions out of Europe to the U.S. or elsewhere. And as I've said in my prepared remarks, we are rapidly building also in Asia, and I believe that Asia will be a magnet. We've seen one of our competitors building a Hong Kong clearinghouse, another one of our competitors also building a Singapore clearinghouse. So you're going to see this magnet that's going to pull positions also to Asia. I don't think our shareholders should be particularly concerned about this. The return on invested capital that should we put more money into a default fund will be significant. It will attract business, and these are growth areas for us and they're areas that we're happy to invest in. One of the things that Scott put in his prepared remarks is that we now open our U.S. clearinghouse for OTC swaps at 3:00 in the morning. That's an additional investment that we made in infrastructure, in personnel, in technology, because we're seeing non-U.S. business want to have access to that clearinghouse because of the kinds of investment that we're making. And it really is attracting flow. So we look forward to high ROIC returns from these businesses.","Scott A. Hill","The only thing, Christian, I'd very quickly add is the regulatory capital required is not uncertain at all. We know exactly what that is. It's disclosed in our K. It's probably another $130 million or $140 million that we're going to put into ICE Clear Europe from a regulatory capital standpoint. And that's it, and that's accounted for. And then the point to Jeff to the extent we determine that it's appropriate to invest more in our guaranteed fund, which we're certainly are looking at, that again is not anything that gives me any concerns with regards to our overall capital. And I don't think it will restrict us from doing some of the other things that we've been doing in terms of capital returns.","Chinedu Christian Onwugbolu - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes. No, I'm clear on the EMIR one. I was -- I'm actually more looking for some sort of thoughts in terms of numbers for the Guaranty Fund. But I hear you guys loud and clear, and thanks for the very, very detailed response. My follow-up question is really on the NYSE business. Just given all the changes you are proposing, Jeff, to market structure, the real strength in the listings business, technology rationalization. Curious as to where you think operating margins for that business can now ultimately get to? And then secondly, a follow-up on that would be just strategically, how important is this business to the very long-term future of ICE?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","It's a good question. I'm not going to give you a specific target. But I think people will be surprised that we really believe the NYSE cash equities business can operate at very high operating margins. And I think we, in fairness, the market watched NYSE and its other U.S. competitor lose market share over a period of time and have to change their business models. But we now see market share growing, we see the trends increasing. And we're putting up a business underneath that, an operational business underneath that, that will deliver very, very high returns. We can see it already. It's already -- it already really improved our performance in the last part of 2014. We're projecting even more for '15 and '16. One of the things if you look at the circular chart that Scott laid out on Slide 6, where we show our breakup of revenue, you'll see that what we have really built over the last year or 2 inside ICE is a very, very big data distribution business, to the point that about 40% of our revenues are no longer variable revenues. These are high-value recurring revenues, predictable, where, I believe, we are really providing interesting things and have some pricing power and the ability to massively expand our distribution into that space. And certainly, data and offshoots of the NYSE, you can see is contributed in there. So we'll -- we want you to monitor that business. We're certainly investing in it. It's why we bought SuperDerivatives, for example. And we'll be rolling out more products and services over the next few years in that area. And I think that will help determine how strategic these businesses are for us.","Operator","And the next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Since we're on the topic of EMIR, I believe 2015 represents mandatory clearing obligations for certain interest rate swaps. And I think interest rates swap clearing made it into Slide 13. So a couple of questions on it. I guess, first, is it possible to give us your view on sizing the opportunity? I guess, what I'm looking for is for ICE and given the competitive nature of interest rate swap clearing, can this be a bigger business than the credit swap business for you, again it's over time? And then second, just where do we stand on developing and executing your strategy to clear interest rate swaps? And are there any milestones that you can share for us in terms of interest rate clearing? Anything that you have for goals for '15 or '16 or '17 that's worth sharing.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","That's a tough question. First of all, we haven't announced anything along those lines. So -- is the short answer. But what we are doing is we have rolled out a number of futures products that we think will attract standardized business that we think can be listed and that can replace much of what was done in the swaps world, including our acquisition of the Irish patent abilities -- capabilities to launch interest rate swaps in Europe based on that as well as credit swaps. So you've seen -- we have a number of swap futures products, and what you've seen us do so far is to use our current infrastructure, our current delivery mechanisms and our current customer base to bring more products along that capability. I've mentioned that, in my prepared remarks that we bought SuperDerivatives, which really has an amazing employee pool that understands very, very complex derivatives, and we've been working with them to try to figure out how best to utilize their expertise in our clearing houses. I think, over time, to answer your question about competition, clearing houses that really have invested in the ability to model and see risk and manage risk to the benefit of the end users that pass muster with the regulators and our board and shareholder base are going to be big winners, and that's what you've seen us investing in over the last few years. And so I think that the growth trend around that will continue.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Is it a big opportunity? Like, should we be focusing there? Like it seems like, again, it was -- it kind of slipped into Slide 13. Like, you were early in credit, you dominate credit, it's a big revenue generator. Can we be -- can things be as good for you in interest rate swaps eventually as they are for you in credit swaps over time?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, the interest rate market is huge and complex and touches all kinds of -- actually, there's all kinds of submarkets within the interest rate market. But right now, we're living in the Western world, in a 0 interest rate environment, for all intents and purposes, in some cases, negative interest rate environment. Nobody needs to hedge negative interest rates. And so what -- the size of that market is going to be very, very much driven by monetary policy. But I think I've mentioned on this call before that one of the things that happens in the low interest rate environment is that people borrow money and they put it to work in all kinds of different places, and it's very hard to know where it's going. And when interest rates do rise, and I suspect they will eventually rise here, people that have invested in low interest rate activities are going to want to hedge those out quickly. And I think you'll see a dramatic rise. In fact, here in the U.S. interest rate environment there -- it's been incredibly active, even though it's very, very unclear what our monetary policy in the U.S. is really going to be. But just the prospect that it might change has really gotten tremendous volumes, volumes that in many cases are bigger than 2007 top of the market kind of volumes. So I think these are big opportunities, at the right moment in time, with the right products set, and that's what we have been spending a lot of time with the pretty sophisticated group now that we have, analyzing and trying to position ourselves for.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And for the follow up, Scott, for listings revenue, it was up a bunch. Did 4Q include pricing changes, or did the pricing changes not kick in until 2015?","Scott A. Hill","The pricing changes will start on January 1. But, Ken, I would point out that a lot of the revenue growth in listings is really about the great listings year we had last year and the number of wins that we had. You saw it in the fourth quarter, as you said, tremendous fourth quarter really based on that performance. And as we roll into next year, that's the bigger factor, the far more relevant factor that's going drive revenue growth as you move through next year -- or this year, sorry.","Operator","And the next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Back to the oil topic for a second. So, Jeff, thanks for the commentary around volatility. All of that makes sense. I think the one interesting point here is, of course, growth in the open interest that we've seen in the oil franchise, even year-to-date up massively. Can you speak a little bit about the source of the growth in the open interest if you guys have seen a noticeable shift between the top of users that have come in to the market now versus, let's say, a year ago? And how sticky do you think this is going to be amid this kind of volatility back drop?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","It's a good question. We have really targeted our energy business at commercial users, and so the growth in open interest has really been commercially-oriented. And we found that, that businesses is very, very sticky. I mean, those -- the commercial uses are the ultimate hedgers and so they hold open interest and then they manage those positions over the long term as things change. And so we're really in a very luxurious position with respect to that particular franchise and how we've taken it to market and the results that we've seen in these volatile periods. It's partly why our market share in the global oil market is up, frankly. And [indiscernible].","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It doesn't sound like a major mix shift change there.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","No. Correct.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Now a follow-up for Scott. There's a lot of concerns in the market place regarding your guys' foreign exchange and currency translation exposure. It doesn't seem like it really made a difference in the fourth quarter despite the stronger dollar. But maybe talk a little bit about how we should think about it for 2015 on a pretax income basis. If the dollar continues to strengthen against the euro and other currencies, how much is hedged, how much is not? What would be the impact?","Scott A. Hill","Yes, look, I think that concern was way overblown. And I think it remains way overblown. As you saw in the quarter, it was almost a nonissue, effectively was a nonissue, and the pound only was down 2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and the year a little bit more than that. As I said in my prepared remarks, we are predominantly a dollar-based revenue company. We do have, clearly, some euro and pound exposures, but at the end of the day, it's very small in the scheme of things. And to the extent we've got balance sheet risk, of course, we hedge those, to the extent we've got the euro notes, of course, that's naturally hedged with the euros we set aside to prepay it. So it was a nonissue in the quarter. I suspect it will be a nonissue through the year. And the reality is it's a part of earning the global business. But to the extent that there is a significant move one way or the other, we've just got to manage through it and work our expense base to deliver the profit, and that's what we intend to do.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Maybe another way to think about it at a high level, the way that I think about it, is that the commodity business around the world is largely dollar denominated, and we just decided years ago to put our commissions in dollars. When we bought the Liffe exchange, which is a British exchange, it's located in the U.K., and it had both euro and pound-denominated contracts, but because it was located in U.K., for many of its European currencies, it charged commission in pounds even if the currency was in a different. And we have expenses in pounds because we're still operating a large European business. So we're a very, very dollar-denominated company.","Operator","And the next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Scott, just on the guidance that you gave. I think it's on both, I would say, capital and expenses. Just wanted to get a sense. When you think about capital deployment in 2015 and even '16, like the balance that we've been seeing in terms of the buybacks, the dividend, acquisitions, it's still like a good mix. And then in terms of the acquisitions that you gave as the revenue and expenses that are coming on in the fourth quarter, just wanted to get a sense, it seems like the margins are a little low in that business. When we think about it over the next couple of years, is it a revenue growth opportunity? Are there any synergies related to these acquisitions. I just wanted to see where those margins will shake out.","Scott A. Hill","Yes, both good questions. So the first answer with regards to the capital deployment mix, I do think that thinking about it, consistent with what you've seen in the past, is the right way to think about it. And so I think you're exactly right on that. With regards to the profitability of the acquisitions, the one thing I would note is, as Jeff alluded to, we've got a terrific base of employees that came to us due to the SuperDerivatives acquisition. A number of them are working on initiatives that are going to show up outside of the acquisitions themselves, whether it's work on additional clearing that will generate revenues, et cetera. So I don't think you can look at the value of those businesses strictly in the expenses and revenues that are directly related to those businesses, you have to look at our overall revenues and the value it'll bring as we deploy the resources across the broader revenue opportunity we see.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. An then, Jeff, you kind of hit on this, but just getting back to oil. I think there's -- some of the pushback that we end up getting is that when oil is at $100 there was a big reason for users to hedge, and at $50, maybe there's less of a reason. It seems like the data isn't backing that. And if you're someone that's running any type of a corporation that needs to hedge oil, it probably doesn't matter, meaning if it's at $50, more power, too. I mean, it can lock in at this price. I just want to get your sense when you're talking to the users, is that risk management, change with where the price is? Or is it still a constant battle, meaning they're constantly trying to manage their business, hedge what they can protect versus what they have less control on.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","That's a good question, but you always have to remember, there's 2 sides in every trade. And so as oil prices are falling, you have producers that want to lock in higher prices for sales before they fall, and are in the market with their marketing people aggressively trying to do that. The producers are making investments and, often times, have to hedge them in order to get financing and make a longer-term commitment. So you have both -- you have pressure on both sides to lock in prices, and that creates the natural tension that then creates the price discovery process. But long story short, there just -- every time there's volatility, it's -- to me, it's like a hurricane that goes through Florida. After the hurricane goes through, people think about buying home owner insurance and -- when they rebuild their house. And every time there's volatility to the upside and to the down side, both sides of that equation, both buyer and seller think about, after high-volatility periods, that maybe they should lock some in and that's, to a certain degree, what you see going on here. And it looks to us like we're going to be in a pretty volatile environment, you can turn on the TV and -- or read the press and you can see pundits talking about their predictions of where oil prices are going to go in '15, '16 and '17 already, and based on the politics of the oil business.","Operator","And the next question comes from Alex Kramm of UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I can't believe, but I'm going to fit in one more oil question, if it's okay. I think you answered a lot of different topics. But one more, perhaps, when you think about the price of oil and maybe like the investments that we've seen over the last decade or so, I think some folks have argued that what we're seeing right now is certainly a flushing out of some firms that have built up a lot, invested a lot and maybe they won't survive. So I'm just wondering if you're worried yourself about the investment cycle being maybe over for a little bit and maybe some firms that had been contributing to your core commercial growth going away or not contributing the same kind of growth over time, outside of volatility, obviously being very good right now.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Yes, the way I'm thinking about it, which is a lay person, is that the more I talk to our customers, the more I've learned that the fracking wells that have really been responsible in the United States for this tremendous resource that we have, have a very short life. They degrade very, very quickly. And it is not uncommon for wells to only last 18 months. And so capacity, as -- and from the first day that the well starts, they're degrading. So it's almost a given under that circumstance that you're going to see capacity coming out of the market pretty quickly in the United States. And as you do that, supply and demand will change its balance and, theoretically, prices may go up. And so these are not oil wells like I grew up with, where Jed Clampett took a gun and shot it at the ground and oil came bubbling out, and had a geyser that went straight up in the air. This is very -- oil is hard to get out of the ground and degrades quickly and needs constant reinvestment. So it will interesting to watch how the market readjusts. In that regard, that's why I think you see the forward pricing curve that I mentioned already on the move up for future oil prices.","Scott A. Hill","When the forward pricing curves up, open interest out, and as Jeff said earlier, our customer mix, we don't really see any big differences.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","The other interesting just side note to that is that one of the benefits that we've had in the U.S. is very low natural gas prices, which also come from fracking. A lot of that natural gas is natural gas that's associated with oil fracking. It's not drillers that went looking for natural gas, it's drillers that went looking for oil and they get natural gas associated with it, and they basically were pumping the gas out at low prices in order to get at high-priced oil. So the symbiotic nature of associated natural gas with oil is something that will also be interesting to watch to see whether there's price volatility in the U.S. natural gas markets.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","All right, great. And then maybe just to shift topics here for a second. The ICE-Liffe integration, can you just talk a little bit more about, I mean, it seems like it's basically done, but maybe talk a little bit about how customers have reacted to it. I think the Liffe platforms, there were multiple platforms, now you have one platform, different customers, I mean, have you seen any benefits in terms of existing users on the ICE platform, perhaps trying some of the -- trading some of the interest rate products? Do you see any revenue benefits in the near term from what you've done here?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","It's a very good question. You're exactly right in that basically, ICE, the Liffe business was subsumed into the ICE exchange and is on all the ICE platform. But before we could do that merger we had to build out a lot of new technology in the ICE platform that users of the Liffe market had gotten too used to, that did not exist in our other markets. And so what we've done as a result of that have built out a lot more capabilities and flexibilities in the ICE matching engine and trading platform, that we now have the opportunity to look at other markets and think about, \"Okay, we've got this kind of interesting thing that we've built. Where else can it be deployed?\" So the real benefit that we're talking about internally is the technology benefit that was something that we probably would have not built on our own. We are seeing cross-pollinization (sic) [ pollination ]. We are going -- there are traders in the world that chase volatility regardless of asset class. There are people that can price options once they understand the data on the underlying, regardless of what the underlying is. And so what you've seen us do is cross-pollinate our customer base, filled out our data set and historical data so that we can provide option traders that we know with information so they can back test and try option strategies in new markets. So there's a lot of that going on right now. And where are markets where there is not a lot of volatility, there are traders that have largely been sitting on their hands, and those are traders that we've been targeting to bring over to our other markets.","Operator","And the next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","First question, kind of a big picture one on volumes. Your business, like all the exchanges, has a lot of noise quarter-to-quarter, even year-to-year given volatility and so forth. But if we just step back and think about the true organic growth of your franchise from a volume perspective, what do you think that number really is and what do you think would be kind of a realistic target to think about?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","I guess, I would push you to Slide 19, which is the earnings per share that the company has delivered for a decade. And that's how we run the business. We don't run the business for volume, never have. I don't like it. In fact, there are some articles out today about us where we have shed some volume in our U.S. options -- equity options market that was not producing positive returns for us. We don't want negative volumes. We don't want to buy volumes. And we don't care about volumes. We only care about earnings. And so what we have done is we have followed customer trends on where to position ourselves, and increasingly, what you're seeing is that there's a range of services that we're providing, including 40% of our business that is not even volume-centric anymore to customers. So I would say to you that the objectives that I'm held to by our board, that trickles down to everybody that's sitting with me in this room is that we are targeting double-digit earnings growth for our shareholders. And we do that by finding ways of serving customers, whether it's volume or not, whether it's positive volume or negative volume, we're doing -- making earnings grow. And I don't know what more to say other than we've got a very strong track record of doing that, and that's how we're motivated around here.","Scott A. Hill","Well, to just tie a bow around that, volumes were down 16% last year, but revenue was up 3% and EPS were up 15%. If you look at our guidance, we basically guided you to an incremental $200 million of profit right off the top, which is double-digit earnings again. So it's just that that's the measure to which we hold ourselves and that's the measure to which investors ought to hold us.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes, I mean, no question, you guys have a great record of the earnings growth. Quick follow-up on the interest rate complex. QE, in Europe, just announced, we've seen kind of volumes and open interest decline heading into that. As we sit here today, do you guys think where the current volumes are is kind factoring a lot of that in? Or could potentially we see a bit of another leg down as QEs is formally launched now?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","What's interesting is that the -- we look at our European business, it's the euro-denominated business that's been impacted. The sterling-denominated business in the U.K., for example, has really grown. So -- and if you look at our euro-denominated business as a percent of the revenue of this company, it's very small. So we are positioning ourselves for QE changes that add volatility that we think we can grow from what is a very low revenue base for us. So it's important to us. But whether it happens in '15, '16, '17 or '18, we can't predict and it's not necessarily particularly relevant to the downside.","Operator","And the next question comes from Niamh Alexander with KBW.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I guess I wanted to go back to the options a little bit, Jeff. Because I was -- and I'm not sure even if it's 4%, 5% of your earnings not even, the equity options, but the market share has been declining. And is it something that used to be that the New York Stock Exchange would have wanted to be like one of the top 3 options exchanges? Is the view different now? If it's not, a significant profits contributor that you're not necessarily too concerned about being one of the biggest in the industry in that space?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Yes, thanks for the question, Niamh. When we bought the company, there was a deal in place that had negative capture and -- but good market share. And we're just not interested in negative capture business. It's standing on the corner and handing out $5 bills of your shareholders' money, and that's not what we do here. And there are others that are interested in negative capture businesses. And as I think I said before, we're more than happy to send our money-losing businesses to our competitors. They don't even have to steal them. We will -- if they just call us, we'll arrange an elegant transfer to them. And so this is a very calculated market share change on our part. This is not, while it's being discovered, I think, by people writing about it, I think the reality it is -- the company is becoming more profitable. We are very focused on profitability. We have a very good relationship with the major market participants in the option space. We touch them across a whole range of options, not just equity options because of the nature of the way those markets tend to be managed and hedged. And so we're looking at our business holistically and trying to maximize profit, improve our relationships with our customers and not destroy shareholder value. And I don't know and care where the volumes come out. And whether we're the biggest or the smallest, I want to have run a company that's the best.","Scott A. Hill","But I think you've seen most of the impact of those share changes flowed through in the fourth quarter in January, and I think it's likely we stabilize. And then, you also noted the RPC was up well in January. And just to be very explicit, that loss in market share had 0 impact on our bottom line.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then with regards to the whole, kind of, New York Stock Exchange part of the business as it were, I mean, you're clearly still kind of quite deep in the integration, there's a lot to do this year, specifically in that part of the business. And you're also making some noises and making some suggestions with respect to market structure change. But how do you think about where this fits as part of the ICE group medium term and longer term, or maybe in what scenario would it make sense for New York Stock Exchange to be independent again?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","It's a good question. I mean, I woke up over the holidays to an article that somebody predicted that we were going to sell the business in 2015. Even though there's a lot of earnings per share growth that we are going to get out of that business over 15, '16 that we've laid out here, it's -- in that sense, it's an important part of our shareholder story. The actual trading of stocks is only 5% of our revenues. I don't know that the trading of equities is ever going to be wildly profitable for anybody. It's highly competitive, it's highly fragmented, it's highly regulated. And so -- but the ancillary parts that come out of that, which is a fabulous listings franchise and data business, are growing and doing really well. And we've been able to change the trajectory of those and change the cost structure underneath those businesses. So I don't know why we would get rid of that. It's -- I think, our shareholders want to participate in the earnings growth of that business. Now once we reach a terminal value, I guess, we, as I've mentioned before, we hold ourselves to growing earnings. If that business is a drag on us and we can't use it to grow earnings, then it's completely insignificant. And unlike a lot of people in the exchange space, you've seen us shed businesses. We don't -- we will curate where we go and modify what we do. And so it's hard to predict right now, but I can tell you, at least for the next couple of years, that, that is going to be -- that business is going to be a big contributor to our bottom line. So that's how I think about it.","Operator","And the next question comes Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First question for either Jeff or Scott. Thanks for the disclosure on the organic revenue growth, $100 million of data in listings. Maybe if you can talk a little bit also about organic growth from new contracts? Just a couple of days ago, I think you launched 63 new contracts in Europe. It's something you have a long time ago used to disclose about organic revenue growth from new contracts. Maybe just give us a sense of how you see that fitting into the organic growth picture over the next 2, 3 years.","Scott A. Hill","It's a good question. You're right, it's a metric that we've talked about from time-to-time. We look back in the 2014. We were just under about $15 million of incremental revenue that we got from those new products. As we've talked about in the past, that drops straight to the bottom line. It's, give or take, a little bit $0.10 or $0.11 of earnings per share we get from the new products that we've launched over time. The other interesting statistic that I look back is if I look over the last 5 years, we've generated north of $130 million from those new products overall. So as I've said many times in the past, the next $50 million, the next $75 million, it's unlikely that any one of those is driving $100 million, but it definitely adds up. And there's very little incremental cost of launching of those new products. We launched those new products into almost certain demand because the products we launch are ones that customers tell us they need. So it was a nice little adder in 2014. I suspect that will be the case again in 2015.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And do you think there is a lot of capacity to continue doing this on a regular basis going forward?","Scott A. Hill","Yes, I think we've demonstrated, we've got to be over 1,000 new products now that we've launched since we opened up ICE Clear Europe back in 2008. And again, we're in constant dialogue with our customers about the next product they need to fill out their risk management portfolio.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","And if you think about all these new products, we've largely been in our historical commodity business. But now with the acquisition of NYSE Euronext, we have moved into the financial space through interest rates and through credits, that we started organically. So we've got a new palette to paint on there, with interesting new products. That's a lot of work going on internally here to come up with that road map.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Right, right. So your opportunity set is -- opportunity set is greatly expanded with these different businesses. Then, just a follow up on the ICE Benchmark Administration. Jeff or Scott, how do you think about that longer term? I think, Scott, I think you said in a conference at one point, you saw it may be -- potentially that could be $100 million revenue business, like the CDS business, at some point in the future. Maybe if you can give a little sort of a roadmap over the next 2, 3, 4 years, if you think that can actually happen, and what were the drivers.","Scott A. Hill","Yes, I don't recall saying it was going to be $100 million business. I might have commented that it is a business that's similar to the CDS clearing business that we've created. It's really one that effectively didn't exist until we started it with LIBOR a year and change ago. I think the real value of that business, and you're already seeing it, is it started out as the LIBOR administrator. Around that, it's built a governance infrastructure, it's built a discipline around how those rates are determined, it's putting confidence around those rates. That model is replicable in multiple places. And the next step was ISDAFIX, and Jeff talked about that in his remark. The more recent steps was in gold. And so I think there are a couple of opportunities in that business. Number one, I think there's an opportunity to get the market confidence back in those benchmarks and to see growth around those benchmarks, LIBOR, ISDAFIX and gold. But I think we can leverage platform that we've built, the governance structure we've built to deploy it across multiple asset classes. I don't know what the size of that is 2 years from now, 5 years from now, but it's bigger than it is today, and I think it's going to be a meaningful contributor.","Operator","Our the question comes from Neil Stratton with Citi.","Neil Stratton - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Most of my questions have been asked and answered at this point. But just I wanted to ask about dark pools, there's been some -- dark pools have been increasing in the news lately, and there's a buyside consortium, which looks to be formed. I just wanted to get your thoughts on that dynamic.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","So we've been working quietly -- trying to work quietly to build consensus on what a market structure change could look like for the U.S. equities business. And from time-to-time, there've been leaks as those efforts have been going on. It's a dynamic conversation that's happening. We're talking to people all throughout the industry. We're making real progress, I think, in trying to forge consensus around what might be a better structure for everybody. And then, part of that is the ability for large institutional investors to be able to match trades and not move the market through the leakage of information. And that's a very legitimate concern on their part. It exists in every market that we serve in some form or fashion. And oftentimes, in these other markets that we serve, there are broker intermediaries or telephones involved. But given the liquid nature and high degree of standardization in equities, people want to try to do that electronically, and hence, you have the dark pool. So I think it's good that the market is trying to solve for a highly meritorious dark pool solution that gets large size done without leakage of information and without negative consequences that some of the existing dark pools have on the investors and their confidence. And so, in that sense, it would be great if I could own the entire market. We can't. We won't. We never will. And what we do try to do is come up with solutions for our customers for the parts of the market where we do things well. And in the context of meritorious dark pool trading, we think that it's very important that, that listed markets have a good quote, because the dark pool depend on a good quote. And many of the people listening on this call get mark-to-market on these good quotes. And investment decisions are made on good quotes. And companies decide go public and raise capital based on the confidence they have that their stock will be accurately dealt with and treated in the market. And so we're making, I think, real strides in shaping the conversation around how this market should evolve in the United States.","Operator","And the next question comes from Rob Rutschow with CLSA.","Robert Rutschow - CLSA Limited, Research Division","The first question is another one on oil. My understanding had been that the producers were a much bigger part of the market for oil than the consumers, maybe 3x or 4x figure. So, one, is that the case? And then based on your commentary, it sounded like that natural gas market is different where the consumers are maybe more of the market. So is that the case? And do those percentages move around a lot over time?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, let me, I may have, I misspoken. In the natural gas market, the natural producer is a natural gas company, the natural consumer is a natural gas distribution company or regulated utility. So in a sense, there are very few actual consumers in the natural gas market. These are institutional players, institutional -- commercial institutions that are hedging in either their exposure in the cost of producing wells or their exposure in delivering natural gas to customers for which there are regulators that have a voice in. That's a very different market than almost every other market we serve, where buyers and sellers are unregulated and are really hedging for totally commercial reasons, including the oil market.","Scott A. Hill","Yes, I mean you can think about, I mean, airlines are massive consumers of oil. And so in terms of production and consumption, I don't see anywhere near the imbalance you suggest that exists. And in fact, many commercial organizations are consumers of oil and are hedgers in that space as well. So I don't see the balance that you suggested.","Robert Rutschow - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful. A follow up would be, it looked like you -- based on my math, you've got a pretty big pickup in your non-rate financial RPC this quarter. Just wondering if there was -- if it's a mix shift or if there were some pricing changes in FX or equity.","Scott A. Hill","No, most of the rate changes that you're seeing right now are largely mix-related.","Operator","And the last question comes from Kenneth Hill with Barclays.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to come back to some of those changes you've quietly been adjusting for the cash equities market here. I'm wondering, based on some of your discussions, if you believe it's harder to get meaningful data from pilots or limited testing in your own market? And, I guess, I ask because every time we suggest something, it's the thought that it's okay, let's pilot this with the select group of stocks in a specific market, but it would seem like something like reducing caps on access fees or implementing a trade-out rule or doing a mid-day auction would require more complete system enhancement on the market participant side to get some good data out of it. So I guess from your seat, do you think that you can actually get really good data from some of these pilots? Or is it necessary to kind of go out and build a consensus around some of these changes in advance?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","It's a very good question. First of all, I mean, interestingly, the current market structure that I've been advocating change to is technically a pilot. So that word is used pretty broadly in the regulated U.S. equity space. There's diverging views about -- in the market about what would make it better. And there's new data coming in from Canada, Australia and soon, Europe, for changes that they've been making to market structure. So as a result of that, I do think there's more of a consensus forming. But there are diverging views, and it may be that what's good for a large cap stock, very liquid large cap stock, may not be the same that's good for a small-cap stock. And so in that sense, there's conversation about whether or not one size should fit all and should we try some of these things to see whether -- maybe be one size should fit all. And so pilots give you an opportunity to do that. But bear in mind that often times, in the equity world, pilot is not a little tiny thing that's done in a laboratory. It involves everybody in the industry and can actually be quite large, as the current market structure is.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I appreciate the comments there. The last one for me is on CDS. You've got a great year 2014. I see growing OTC clearing is pretty high in your list of opportunities for next year. As you look forward and think about the future growth, is it predicated on more launching new products and bringing in new clearing customers? Or is it through more holistic measures like the swap futures partnerships you announced with Eris and leveraging some open interest you have and something like the Eris, do you expect that to be more of a complimentary product to your traditional CDS? Or is it more of a substitution thing? Just wondering how to think about that when that launches here soon.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","That's a really good question. I think the opportunity -- there are a number of opportunities that will allow us to continue to grow our CDS business. Clearly, continuing to launch new products is a big part of it, big part of the growth that we saw last year was us continuing to introduce sovereign CDS instruments as an example. And we're in constant dialogue with the industry regarding where their CDS risks are in products we don't clear, and that's a clear focus for us. I think continuing to expand the customer base, that clearing CDS is another growth driver, we still don't have a mandate in Europe. But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are seeing a lot of the European clients doing clearing for CDS in our U.S. clearinghouse to get rid -- to get away from the uncertainty that exists in Europe. So I think that will continue to expand. Clearly, a mandate would accelerate that, but I think the market itself without a mandate has started to see the value and realize the value of clearing and the risk mitigation in the CDS space that it brings. And then clearly, I think the Eris product and moving to an alternative product will be incremental. I do think there's likely to be some replacement aspect with regard to CDS index. But with regards to single names, with regards to sovereigns, with regards to a number of other products, I really think effectively, it will be incremental.","Operator","And as we have no more questions, I would like to turn the call back over to management for any closing comments.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Thank you, Keith, and thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you throughout the quarter. Have a good day.","Operator","Thank you.

All participants will be on listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Warren Gardiner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Warren Gardiner","Good morning. ICE's second quarter 2019 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived, and our call will be available for replay.","Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements which we undertake no obligation to update represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2018 Form 10-K.","In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures including adjusted income, EPS, operating income, operating margin, expenses, effective tax rate, free cash flow and EBITDA. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP terms in the earnings materials and explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful; as well as how management uses these measures in our Form 10-Q.","When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction based expenses, and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain terms. With us on the call are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Ben Jackson, our President.","I'll now turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Hill","Thanks, Warren. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide four, with some of the key highlights from our second quarter performance. Earnings per share totaled $0.94, up 4% versus the prior year and equal to our record fourth quarter performance.","During the second quarter, we generated the second highest quarterly revenues in our company's history which yielded record adjusted operating income and record adjusted EBITDA. And importantly, first half free cash flow increased 13%year-over-year enabling us to return over $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Consolidated net revenues in the quarter were $1.3 billion with trading and clearing and data and listings both increasing 5% year-over-year on a constant current basis. Adjusted operating expenses totaled $540 million in the quarter, including roughly $5 million nonrecurring benefit primarily in tech expense.","Additionally, second quarter expenses reflect both the reclassification of certain licensing agreements from net revenues to expenses as well as a small amount related to our acquisition of Simplifile in late June.","Looking forward to the third quarter, we expect adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $552 million to $562 million. This includes $9 million to $10 million related to Simplifile and roughly $10 million related to the aforementioned revenue reclassification. These expenses will be more than offset by around $25 million of revenue and thus accretive to the bottom line.","On a basis comparable to our original expense guidance, we now expect full year adjusted operating expenses to be around the low end of that range and between $2.14 billion and $2.16 billion, adding in roughly $50 million for the full year amounts related to Simplifile and the revenue reclass and noting again that those expenses will be more than offset by additional revenue.","Adjusted operating expenses are expected to be in the range of $2.19 billion to $2.21 billion. We've included slide 11 in the Appendix to provide additional clarity on this update.","Now let's move to slide five, where I'll provide additional color on the performance of our trading and clearing segment. In the second quarter, net revenues were up 4% year-over-year or 5% on a constant currency basis.","In our energy market, Average Daily Volumes, or ADV, were down 2% year-over-year. However, total energy revenues increased 2% versus the prior year on a constant currency basis resulting in the second best quarter in our history. This strong performance was driven primarily by continued growth in our European natural gas and global oil products.","Average Daily Volume in our European natural gas business established a new record during the second quarter and open interest is up 29% over the prior year through July. In addition, ADV in the broad suite of crude and refined oil related contracts that make up our global oil business increased 14% year-over-year in the second quarter with open interest up 25% at the end of July.","Overall, July energy trends remain positive with ADV up 9% and open interest up 4% on a year-over-year basis. ADV in our agriculture & metals market also set a record in the second quarter driven by strong performance in both our sugar and coffee products. This was mitigated somewhat by weaker * rate per contract driven by customer and product mix.","ADV remained strong in July, up 7% year-over-year. Revenue in our financial futures business, which includes both our interest rate and equity index products declined year-over-year. A difficult political and economic environment as well the tough compare versus the prior year impacted interest-rate volumes.","However, we're off to a really good start in July with interest rate ADV increasing 29% year-over-year led by a 60% increase in Euribor volumes. Importantly, open interest across the rates business is up 10% year-over-year, including Sterling open interest which is up 40%. In our equity index business, MSCI ADV was up 16% in the second quarter and remained strong in July with ADV up 7%.","Turning next to slide six, I'll discuss our data and listings segment. Second quarter listings revenues totaled $111 million. The NYSE raised nearly $20 billion in IPO proceeds during the quarter ranking first globally. During the first half of 2019, the NYSE helped raised 55% of total U.S. IPO proceeds including 75% of U.S. tech proceeds.","Moving to data services; on a constant currency basis, revenues grew 6% year-over-year to a record $553 million; and pricing and analytics revenues grew 4% on a constant currency basis helped by strong growth in our index business.","Entering the third quarter, pricing and analytics ASV is up 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and we expect revenue growth will reaccelerate in the second half.","Exchange data and feeds grew 9% on a constant currency basis. Strength in our futures business, which grew 7% in the second quarter as well as higher tape revenue related to share increases at the NYSE drove the strong performance.","While we expect demand for our futures-related exchange data products to continue to grow, lower tape revenues and continued softness in NYSE prop data will likely result in a sequential decline in total exchange data revenues in the third quarter.","And finally, in desktops and connectivity, revenue increased 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Growth in the ICE Global Network as well as desktop and chat platforms was partially offset by weakness in some of our NYSE connectivity services.","Moving forward and despite currency impact, we remain on track to our original full year data revenue guidance, and we expect data revenues to be in the range of $550 million to $555 million during the third quarter.","Our continued focus on serving our customers combined with disciplined investments to support growth and profitability across our diverse business once again delivered solid results in the first half of 2019. We grew revenues, operating income, earnings per share, and free cash flow.","We returned more capital to shareholders in the first half of 2019 than in any other half year period in our history, and we are laser focused on building on this momentum to deliver a strong second half of the year and to strengthen the foundation for continued success in 2020.","I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A, but for now I'll turn it over the Ben.","Ben Jackson","Thank you, Scott, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'll begin on slide seven. Over the last 20 years how energy is produced and consumed has rapidly evolved, so too have global trade flows, as well as the technology and data available to market participants.","We have continuously invested alongside this evolution building a global platform that today is one of the most diverse and liquid energy marketplaces in the world. In our oil business, Brent crude stands as the cornerstone of a franchise spanning key price benchmarks such as Gasoil, WTI, and Platts Dubai, which is one of the leading markers for crude traveling through Asia.","Together these benchmarks form the foundation for a cohesive web of more than 600 related oil products such as locational spreads, product spreads and refining spreads. These are precise risk management tools that benefit from the deeper liquidity in and their relationship to our global oil benchmarks.","Driven by the breadth of our commercial customer base, we have become the natural home for liquidity in these products with open interest in our global oil products up 25% year-over-year to over 5.5 million contracts or over 40% of our total oil open interest.","Our global natural gas complex spans trading hubs across North America, Europe and Asia. The globalization of natural gas is a trend we've been investing in for over five years. Beginning with our investment in index. That investment established us as a leader in European gas trading.","With Asia as the largest buyer of global LNG, the relationship between our European benchmark and Platts JKM, our Asian benchmark is driving global price formation. These new dynamics demand that commercials, investors and traders have a global view.","European customers must be aware of supply and demand factors in Asia just as a buyer in Asia must be cognizant of trends facing European markets. LNG shipments out of the Gulf are increasingly pricing away from Henry Hub.","And as our benchmarks become more global, we are seeing participation increased with the number of trading firms in our European TTF market doubling since 2015, while average daily volume has increased a 124% this year alone.","In addition, a few weeks ago, we announced an agreement to extend our partnership with Platts to bring the eWindow platform to the global LNG trading community replicating our successful strategy in the oil markets.","The Platts eWindow will leverage our unique WebICE technology enabling customers to transparently submit bids and offers and execute trades while simultaneously participating in the Platts price assessment process.","The globalization of natural gas alongside of global focus on decarbonization is also critical to the environmental markets. In Europe and the U.S. regulators are increasing the focus on incentivizing the use of renewables and cleaner fossil fuels such as natural gas over coal. Incentives include introducing cap and trade programs and renewable energy standards.","Built off of our acquisition of the climate exchange nearly a decade ago, we operate the world's largest emissions markets. And as demand for transparent pricing and carbon grows, our markets are well-positioned to capture these trends.","Economies around the globe are demanding and consuming more energy. Sources such as renewables will continue to be introduced into the mix and these energy sources are unpredictable by nature.","Their interplay with fossil fuels and energy production has the potential to drive additional volatility in global energy markets, and will require traders to consume more data and integrate more robust analytics into their workflows. This is an evolution that we've long envisioned and have positioned our business to benefit from and we're excited about the future opportunities that lie ahead.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff Sprecher","Thank you, Ben, and good morning to everyone on the call. The evolution of our energy market is one example of how we're continuously investing and developing customer driven solutions across asset classes, as well as the creative approach we've taken to leverage our infrastructure, our technology and our expertise to drive value creation.","In areas such as data services, we're leveraging our core fixed income pricing and reference data, developing new fixed income benchmarks such as our suite of muni indices and launching real-time fixed income yield curves and credit risk tools.","We're investing in our fixed income analytics, enhancing the functionality and now delivering it through an API to broaden the addressable market. In the second quarter, we launched the ICE Data Vault, a cloud-based data repository that leverages our consolidated feed business and delivers historical data from over 600 global sources.","And we've invested in our sales footprint, adding coverage across both the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. These are just a few examples of the initiatives and the new products that we're bringing to the market.","They demonstrate how we are taking the former IDC Foundation, one that traditionally serve the back and middle offices, and we're enhancing it to dry transparency and liquidity, while we also expand our addressable market further into the front office.","When we combined the long tail secular trends, such as the electronification of bond markets, workflow automation and the shift from active to passive fund management, our comprehensive data offering is positioned to continue to deliver compounding growth well into the future.","Towards the end of 2019, we expect to launch our ETF Hub, an innovative solution that will serve the $1 trillion fixed income ETF industry, an industry that some expect will double in size over the next five years.","With ETF Hub, we'll bring to market a single portal, one would -- that will be unique to the market to connect multiple participants and provide a more efficient solution for sponsors and traders to manage and execute their primary market orders.","In addition, the SEC is reviewing regulation around the use of custom baskets for the broader ETF sponsor community, a change that over time could provide additional tailwinds for activity on our ETF Hub platform.","Ultimately, we view the ETF Hub is one of the first steps towards building a more automated, efficient and complete ecosystem serving the fixed income trading and investing community.","We're also investing in our equity derivatives business, launching eight new MSCI contracts in the first half of the year. Led by the flagship emerging market index, open interest in our MSCI complex has more than doubled over the last five years to nearly 2 million contracts at the end of July, while average daily volume is up 12% year-over-year.","At the New York Stock Exchange we executed our second successful direct listing, as Slack went public through this innovative offering. An offering is maximized by NYSE's hybrid model, coupled to a dedicated market maker that is compensated under the rules of the exchange, thereby combining dedicated human judgment with state-of-the-art technology.","During the quarter, we also launched the NYSE Board Advisory Council, a creative initiative that leverages the unmatched network of the NYSE and one that seeks to address some of the important EFG issues that face corporation today.","As we look at opportunities across other asset classes such as mortgages and digital assets, we're applying our unique approach to platform building and innovation. In our mortgage business, we closed on our acquisition of Simplifile on the second quarter and added a key piece of infrastructure, one that complements our suite of digital solutions aimed at bringing more efficiency to the $11 trillion U.S. mortgage industry.","At Bakkt subject to final regulatory approvals we plan to launch our physically delivered Bitcoin futures in the very near future. As use cases for digital assets and payment flows advance, Bakkt is working to build a regulated digital asset ecosystem that serves the evolving needs of institutions, merchants and consumers around the world.","Let me close by having you turn to slide nine. As we turn back to the first half of this year, we're focused on building on our long track record of growth, while we stay concentrated on the execution and investing for our future.","I want to close by thanking our customers for their business and their trust. And I want to thank my colleagues for their efforts that contributed to yet another very very strong quarter for ICE.","And with that, and as my prepared remarks, let me turn our call back to Carrie to conduct the question-and-answer session which will operate until 9:30 AM Eastern time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Richard Repetto of Sandler O'Neill.","Richard Repetto","Good morning, Jeff, Scott, and Ben. It's been an early morning for some of us. And I guess with the LSE Refinitiv confirmation of the announcement this morning, it seems like they've taken a page out of your playbook with a focus on market data and certainly they have some fixed income and FX trading platforms as well. I guess, the question, Jeff, is you know how do you see this impacting your businesses, this one-stop shopping for market data? And how would you differentiate what you're offering versus what could be a potential LSE Refinitiv combined platform?","Jeff Sprecher","Well, that's a great question. Thanks for asking it. First of all, we are fortunate that we saw the move to that kind of pivot very early so that we were able to acquire some very, very strategic assets that what today would be viewed as incredibly attractive valuations to build the foundation for what we offer today. And as you see the footprint that we\u2019ve pivoted towards in data was really around fixed income data more than anything. And in that space \u2013 it's a unique space, and one of the things that we were able to acquire with IDC was a 50-year-plus history of a high quality fixed income data that is hard to replicate for new entrants simply because of time.","And what we find is people, the buy side and sell side that are doing analytics and what have you, need that rich robust data set in order to back test portfolio theories and other things. Separately, the fixed income business is interesting in that only a very tiny amount of fixed income trades on any given day. It's probably less than 5% of fixed income names in the muni space where we\u2019ve really put a big investment. It's less than 1%. And so, the algorithms and knowledge base that comes from that foundation is really important much more so than the trading platforms, which is why we \u2013 as we realized that we pivoted hard into acquiring indices, legacy data sets, and other relationships as opposed to execution venues as you've seen, because that will not change with the electronification of the business in our mind.","So, we're well-positioned. It's a space we expect more competition in. It\u2019s a space we expect more* consolidation around. One of the facts that I mentioned years ago that we began to see partly by acquiring the New York Stock Exchange is that it's very hard to have connectivity to many, many customers because of cybersecurity issues. People want a smaller number of large vendors that have the scale to guarantee that connectivity -- direct connectivity to companies is safe, and so it was somewhat inevitable that there was going to be a roll up in the space, and as I said, that's why we chose some assets quickly and went hard at them very early.","Operator","The next question will come from Michael Carrier of Bank of America.","Michael Carrier","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. First, Scott maybe just on the expenses and the guidance on slide 11, just with the gross and the net expense guide, can you just provide some color on the revenue offsets and maybe which lines that will be flowing through for the second half?","Scott Hill","Sure. Yes. So, slide 11 is the good one to look at. I think the key point I would highlight there is effectively what we did this quarter was bringing the midpoint of our original guidance down by $25 million. And then we added 50 million on top of it, and that's roughly 28 million which was simply a change in how we're treating some revenue share agreements that we have. We're going to treat those as net revenue now, not gross. That's about $28 million. And the vast majority of that is on our financials business, and you saw that in our RPC, which we adjusted the rolling three month is up a couple pennies. There's about $8 million in the second quarter, and then $10 million a quarter in third quarter and fourth quarter.","The other piece is the addition of * Simplifile. As I mentioned that's 9 million to 10 million in the quarter. You could double that and let's assumed for the half it will be 18 million to 20 million. And that's where for the second half we expect revenues in excess of $30 million. And so, we've now got a mortgage business that annualized is a 140 million plus business at very attractive margins. And so, we're really excited about that.","So, I think the way to think about expenses, they brought the midpoint down $25 million for the year. The growth in that change is no impact to the bottom line and Simplifile is* immediately accretive and adds to a really large mortgage business in a quickly digitalizing space.","Operator","The next question will come from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan.","Ken Worthington","Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Maybe on ASV, it's up* less now than it had been in the past. I think the calculation was something like 5.7% organic constant currency. It'd been in high, as high as maybe 6.7% a couple of quarters ago. So what are the biggest drivers in the decline in ASV? I think you guys mentioned equity data. Is there something else as well? Pricing and analytics growth seems to be around 4% now, that's less than it's been in the past. Maybe is that a driver as well. And then lastly, ASV does not capture all the outlook for data. Can you give us an update on the part of data that's not captured by ASV. How is that progressing?","Scott Hill","That's a big bundle of questions. Let me see if I can go work my way through that. So, first of all, you're 100% right to be looking at the ASV metric. That is the key indicator of the very good health of our data business. Because that ASV number represents the 90% of our revenues roughly give or take, that Lynn and her team are outselling every day. The other are non-ASV stuff is session fees and NMS and tape data. We don't sell that. We don't really control that to a great extent. So, you're focused on the right metrics.","I look at an ASV number. I think it was maybe 6.4% last quarter, 6.1% this quarter on a constant currency basis. They're between 5.7% and 6.7% in a given quarter. I don't lose much sleep on. As long as we're pivoting around 6%, I think that's really indicative of a data business that's positioned to deliver the kind of growth that you've seen from us over the past couple years. So, I think the ASV is well-positioned. There is a little bit of weakness on the NYSE exchange data. And that weakness is not that it's going backward. It's just not growing. And so that does have a bit of a downward impact.","But the good news is, you look at futures exchange data, as I said growth in the quarter plus 7%, but no customer erosion at all. You hear from others that customers are going away, we're not seeing that. I think that reflects the commercial orientation of our market. You look at pricing & analytics where it dipped a little bit in the second quarter, but again, an instructive point in that audits come and go. And last year we had a few. The year before that we had a few. This year we didn't. And I mentioned that business is going to re-accelerate 5%, 6% in the third quarter, 6%, 7% in the in the fourth quarter, and coming off a 6% year headed back toward or another 6% year in pricing & analytics.","So, again feel really good about that business, feel really good about the execution from Lynn and the team. And I think ASV metric is a really good indicator that that business is healthy and growing. And the thing that I also hope you noted in the quarter was as we start to get some of the foundational investments behind us in that data business you're starting to see the margin expansion that we would expect from the incremental revenue growth. So, we were up a couple of points year-over-year in the quarter. And again, I think that's reflective of the fact that that business its position to continue to grow is also likely to have very solid incremental margins and expansion overall.","Jeff Sprecher","And Ken, let me just pile on by mentioning that Ben went over on Slide seven, how our energy business has really changed. We started -- when I started the company, we had natural gas was U.S. Henry Hub. Today, you look at the map on slide seven and you see that the energy business has pulled us to Europe and then EMEA, Asia. And so I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're investing in sales and marketing people in these new areas. In other words, the flow of data sales is following the flow of commercial interest in our products. And so it gives us some confidence. We get asked a lot about changes in large banks like yours, [ph] changes that are going on around Brexit, changes in Europe, and what have you. But when you really look at the flow of the way people are integrating with our network you see that it's broadening globally and that's helping to drive those datasets.","Operator","The next question will come from Kyle Voigt of KBW.","Kyle Voigt","Hi. Good morning. Maybe just one more follow up on the LSE Refinitiv transaction. It sounded like from LSE's call this morning that the Refinitiv deal was really shaft or wasn't a highly competitive deal. So I guess my question is were you able to look at the asset prior to the LSE announcement last week. And then, I guess part two of that is just clearly is moving LSE bigger into the front office, which you mentioned in your prepared remarks, with their desktop business are Refinitiv, would that be an area you'd focus on if assets were available in that space in terms of M&A? Thanks.","Jeff Sprecher","Good question. I'm unable to speak to the current transaction. But let me just say to you that, we had -- we've been relatively aggressive at the way we've built ICE over the last couple of decades. And we have had conversation around those assets for more than a decade with multiple management teams, who have had multiple ideas on how we might interface with those including acquisitions, joint ventures, bundling, cross licenses you name it. And we've watched those management teams and discuss with those management teams as they've made major investments in those assets, as they've pulled back from investments in those assets, as they've tried to do cost cutting around those assets, as they've tried to bundle with us, as they've focused on price increases, as they've focused on price decreases. And because it was a public company, we have watched with tremendous detail how those assets have evolved over decades.","And so, we've had many opportunities to engage and we haven't found a way obviously that did something that would -- that we felt would really be accreted to ICE shareholders. That in no way as a comment on the current deal. David Schwimmer and David Warren are two people who I have known for years and highly respect, and are tremendous at what they do and have given us guidance from time to time. And also Joe Baratta and Martin Brand at Blackstone are amazingly sharp and savvy, and so I've got nothing but good feeling about those people in that deal that they did. But as a respects to ICE, over many, many years we were not able to find a way that we can create value.","Operator","The next question will come from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","Hey guys. Good morning. Thanks. So, maybe just a round up the discussion around LSE and Refinitiv, anyway you guys kind of help us think about exposure ICE Data Services has to Refinitiv. I think most of that is going to be on the exchange that aside. But within pricing & analytics is there any sort of revenue exposure there as well and how do you guys think of any potential risks to ICE on the back of that transaction?","Jeff Sprecher","This is Jeff. I don't want to answer that question only because that particular transaction is going to go through a global antitrust review, and I don't want to say something that in any way is used in that review positively or negatively. So don't take that to mean anything other than there is a transcript being made of this call. And I'd rather not have us discussing that particular thing. You're going to give me a pass?","Operator","The next question will come from Dan Fannon of Jefferies.","Dan Fannon","Thanks. Can you talk about the ETF Hub in more detail and timing of launch, kind of your expectations and maybe some of the incentives that you're going to put out there to attract participants to that offering?","Ben Jackson","Sure. Dan. This is Ben. And thanks for the question. So we've been talking about this on many calls and we're really excited about it, because we are deep in the testing phase right now with a lot of the institutional buy side and sell sides that are going to onboard onto this platform as it launches. And our target launch date is in the fourth quarter of this year and we feel really good about it on how the testing process has gone. One of things that excites us about this and Jeff had highlighted in some of the comments he made that we have a multi-decade relationship on the institutional side of these buy side and sell side firms between our pricing, our reference data, our analytics and our index offerings. And what this is enabling us to do is we're going to be really combining that set of offerings with our execution capabilities in TMC and BondPoint that have historically been in the wealth management space, but have protocols that are really oriented towards the new wave of electrification and fixed income with central order book trading. And you're obviously hearing that other platforms out there are trying to race to build similar capabilities to what these platforms already have.","So, as we're now going through the testing process and we're now onboarding customers into the ETF Hub, these institutional customers through the testing process for the technical integration process as well as the legal onboarding we are coupling the onboarding process of that ETF Hub for a lot of these institutional buy sides that have traditionally not been on our venues to also onboard onto TMC, BondPoint, or auction in our RFQ protocols. So for the first time a lot of these institutional buyers and sellers will have an opportunity to use our venues that have historically not interacted with that order flow in the secondary market.","So that's all upside for us to be able to compete in an area that we traditionally have in secondary trading. And in primary trading which is where the ETF Hub is, we're going to have as Jeff highlighted in his comments, the unique solution for the industry that solves a ton of inefficiency that there is. And because we're solving that inefficiency and helping all these market participants save an additional amount of cost, reduce risk and hopefully continue to grow an asset class that has seen explosive growth. We see recurring revenue opportunities coming from this, from clients onboarding on it as a natural output of it.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Great. Thanks. Good morning folks. I was going to ask one on the Refinitiv as well, but Jeff, you might not answer, given the global antitrust review. But one I'll ask and then I'll have a second question, you can pick one of the two.","Jeff Sprecher","Okay. Fair enough.","Brian Bedell","The Refinitiv one with just longer term thoughts on how it could change pricing in the industry given how you've gone out to a lot of large customers and have been able to successfully bundle a lot of data services together, whether the Refinitiv transaction changes that dynamic longer term in that strategy? And then the second question would be on energy. And the question there is given that product range that you guys outlined a lot in this call. Is there a view of broadening out the customer base there? You've traditionally been very happy in the commercial side to doing things to introduce more market making and proprietary trading and perhaps even retail usage of energy futures?","Jeff Sprecher","I think we'll try to answer both questions. So, yes, I think you thread the needle. So, yes, the notion of trying to bundle content and distribution is something that's unique to financial services. It is the play in media and transportation and many other industries around the world. And so, I do think that that trend will continue. I do think that competition authorities are going to pay attention to that. And which is why I'm not prepared to get too in-depth with somebody else's strategy versus our strategy.","But I think ultimately our industry has been going through consolidation, not just in platform providers, if you will like ICE, but buy side firms and sell side firms, and the way assets are gathered and managed. And so it's somewhat of an inevitability in my mind that you're going to see winners emerge. And as I mentioned, I'm glad that we made the transition early, so that that we had a look at all of these assets and could figure out which ones really would work for the specific kind of platform and distribution, and content that we think can continue to deliver top line growth. You can bundle downward growth as well you know. So the idea here is to create compelling bundles that more customers want that can drive EPS growth. And I know we've done that.","Warren Gardiner","Youu want to pick up the [Indiscernible].","Jeff Sprecher","Yes.","Warren Gardiner","Go ahead.","Jeff Sprecher","So, on the energy side just to pick up on the question -- second question you had there. So you're right, we have focused on the commercial hedger in building out a diversified product suite around the world. And when we say that, we're focused on the commercial hedger. I think one of the important distinctions that not everyone appreciates is what we mean by that. What we mean is that, we've established a set of diversified products. So the product that people are actually consuming, whether it's various grades of crude oil or its refined products and also enabling at the point of consumption of those goods, putting locations around the world for where these customers are either buying or selling the end commodity.","That enables them to as precisely as possible manage their exposure to price risk where they have the most acute risk, which is at that point of consumption. And this is distinct from many of the other peers that are out there, where they primarily focus on a single product and trying to attract customers, which could be halfway around the world to interact with a product that they may have no commercial connection to.","If you look at products that we've developed in Asia for example like Singapore Gasoil, Fuel Oil, Singapore Jet Kerosene, these are a small sample set of hundreds and hundreds of products that we have around the world in our global oil and refined products suite that we've been partnering with our customers to build. And we have an -- have had \u2013 have today and continued to build on and grow market share in this part of our business as Scott had pointed out, open interest up 25% and volumes even accelerated this month to up 17% in this week [ph].","The last thing I'd point out is the reason we focus on the commercial is that to have a real vibrant market. It starts with the Cornerstone, which has to be the commercial trader that really cares about that physical instrument that's underpinning -- that's underpinning the price formation and the really the real risk around consuming the end good at the particular location. And what we've seen is, if you get that right, market makers, financials and those follow into that market. And that's what we've seen in all of the markets that we've developed. So we do focus on each of those areas that you had mentioned, but we really focus on getting the commercial aspect of it right first. And that's why we're seeing this area of our business significantly grow.","Operator","The next question will be from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo.","Chris Harris","So, part of ICE's value proposition in fixed income data is really offering valuation services for harder to value securities. So I'm wondering as more trading moves to electronic and becomes more transparent, how do you think this part of the data business will evolve?","Ben Jackson","Thanks Chris. This is Ben. I'll take this. So I think one of comments Jeff made in an answer to a question earlier today is very important to highlight. In that if you look at the corporate bond space where you have 30,000 instruments, on a given day the number of instruments out of at 37 \u2013 or 30,000 corporate bonds that are out there, less than 2000 of those trade every single day. So even as electrification takes hold, you're talking about 5% or less of the market is actually trading in a given day. And with the explosion of data and the more precision the people want around managing their risk and pricing instruments moving not only from end of day, but to intraday, you can imagine the algorithm that's needed to understand what the correlations are of all the different instruments that actually do trade in given day, and having to figure out what does that mean for something that hasn't traded in a day, a week or a month.","And when we talk about the multiple decades of being that trusted pricing and reference data provider to our customers, having that history, having that trust of being able to build out that complex algorithm, having trained it over many, many decades puts us in a position that I think is very, very strong. We'll continue to grow as data and information assets continue to grow around this space.","Operator","And this concludes our question and answer session. I will now like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Sprecher for any closing remarks.","Jeff Sprecher","Thank you, Carrie and thank you all for your participation in today's call. And we'll look forward to being back next question to similarly give you our great results.","Operator","Thank you, sir. The conference is now concluded. Thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a great day."],"11851":["Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Kelly Loeffler. Please go ahead.","Kelly Lynn Loeffler - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Good morning. ICE's second quarter 2017 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investor Section of theice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements.

We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP term in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful as well as how management uses these measures.","When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share.

And I want to thank all of you for the opportunity to work together in my investor relations capacity from the early days of ICE. I look forward to continuing my role as ICE's Chief Communications and Marketing Officer. Also with us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Chuck Vice, President and Chief Operating Officer.","I'll now turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Thanks, Kelly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll start on slide 4, with some of the key highlights from our second quarter. ICE's record revenue was driven by balanced growth across each of our business segments. Data revenues grew 6% versus the prior second quarter on a constant currency basis, driven by strong results in both pricing and analytics, and desktops and connectivity.","In our trading and clearing segment, average daily volume or ADV grew 28% and open interest increased 12% year-to-year. Our double-digit volume growth and open interest trends reflect continued robust demand for our global trading and clearing services.","Our record revenue results combined with continued expense discipline generated three points of adjusted operating margin expansion, and record adjusted earnings per share, which grew 9% over the prior year.","And importantly, through the first half of 2017, we have generated roughly $900 million of free cash flow, which has allowed us to achieve our leverage target even as we return nearly 80% of that to investors.","Now, let's move to slide 5, where I'll recap our second quarter consolidated financial results. Second quarter revenues were a record $1.2 billion, up 6% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted operating expenses in the second quarter were down 1% to $488 million, and adjusted operating margins expanded to 59%.","Adjusted earnings per share increased 9% year-over-year to a record $0.75. As we look to the balance of the year, we expect third quarter and fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses in the range of $480 million to $490 million. We also expect to refinance our October bond maturities and anticipate that interest expense will be around $47 million for the third quarter and $49 million for the fourth quarter. Finally, we expect the tax rate to be around 31% in the third quarter. Please refer to our earnings release for further guidance details.","Please turn to slide 6, where I'll discuss our data and listings segment. These largely recurring revenues comprise over half of our consolidated revenues in the second quarter. Segment revenues grew 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis including data revenues, which grew 6%. We expanded adjusted operating margins by 4 points year-over-year to 54%, which drove an 11% year-over-year increase in adjusted operating income.","During the second quarter, we recognized a few million dollars related to ongoing data audits that concluded sooner than anticipated. Entering the third quarter, we also expect the ongoing integration of Securities Evaluations (05:10) to lower revenues by a couple million dollars, reflecting the rationalization of duplicative business lines.","Even though we now expect 3Q data revenues to be a little below heightened second quarter levels, fourth quarter revenues will reaccelerate and we remain confident that we will deliver at least 6% growth for the year. Within our data revenues, pricing and analytics revenues increased 5% year-to-year on an organic constant currency basis driven by new customers and new product offerings.","Our exchange data revenues grew 2% on top of last year's second quarter, which was up 17%. Continued strong demand for exchange data on both our rates and commodities platforms was partially offset by muted trends in cash equities markets related to historically low volatility environment.","Finally, revenue in our desktop and connectivity category grew 7% year-on-year, on an organic constant currency basis, reflecting strength in both our connectivity and feeds businesses, which are benefiting from trends away from traditional delivery methods such as desktops","For a little more color as to what is driving our data revenue growth, let's shift to slide 7. As I previously noted, we remain on track to grow the data business at least 6% on a constant-currency basis. As highlighted at our Investor Day in June, an important contributor to our confidence in this business is the momentum we continued to see in new business signings during the first half of 2017.","First-half new contract signings in EMEA were up 18% and pricing and analytics signings in Asia-Pacific increased 15%. Finally, as we entered the third quarter, ASV or the annual subscription value is up 5% year-over-year. Underpinning this growth is 7% ASV growth in pricing and analytics and 8% growth in desktops and connectivity.","Exchange data ASV was flat year-over-year against very strong growth in the prior period. Importantly, as a point-in-time metric, ASV does not reflect the future benefit of the cross-sell opportunities that our fully integrated sales team will continue to deliver, nor does it reflect any future pricing actions.","Next on slide 8, I highlight the strong performance of our listings business. As previously noted, we've had great success in a very robust IPO market through the first half of this year. The NYSE is ranked as the number one listing venue for U.S. IPOs with 49 new listings and $19 billion of capital raised. And as you know, these wins drive listings revenue growth primarily in the subsequent year, while also generating meaningful adjacent revenues across both our trading and data segments.","The NYSE continues to be the venue of choice for world-class companies and entrepreneurs. Through the first half, over 88% of all capital rate by the IPOs of U.S. operating companies and 28 of the past 28 initial listings above $700 million have happened on the NYSE. I'd like to pause here and note that with the sale of NYSE Governance Services on June 1, we expect listings revenues and expenses to each decline by approximately $4 million sequentially.","I'll review our trading and clearing segment beginning on slide 9. Revenues were up 6% year-to-year on a constant currency basis and represent our second best quarter ever for futures transaction revenues. We also expanded our operating margin to 64%. As the leading global energy marketplace, we continue to innovate and now, for example, offer more than 500 oil products. We've seen strong growth again this year in our energy benchmarks in our new products as well as European interest rates and MSCI equity indices.","ADV for the quarter was up 28% and we set ADV records in our Brent, sterling, and MSCI contracts. Finally, as you'll have seen in our volume press release this morning, the momentum continued in July with ADV up 11% and OI up 10%. And importantly, we saw a solid uptick in our energy and rates RPC in July versus June, coupled with continued volume growth.","Continuing to slide 10, you can see that the growth in trading and clearing has been very balanced with contributions across our diverse global futures markets. ADVs for the first half was up 15% versus a strong first half last year, including record commodity volumes of 3.3 million contracts and record sterling volumes of 1.1 million contracts during the second quarter. Perhaps more importantly, open interest was up 12% versus the prior second quarter and up 22% versus the end of last year. Open interest is a key barometer of customer interest and engagement in our markets over the longer term.","Turning now to slide 11, you can see how the operating margins in both our trading and clearing segment and our data and listing segments compared to our peers. Not only do the absolute margins distinguish ICE, but we have positioned ourselves in businesses which will generate high incremental margins on future revenue growth. This is enabled by execution of our synergy commitments and the proprietary nature of many of our product offerings.","We have curated a diverse global business by organically investing in product innovation, by opportunistically acquiring assets from which we are able to extract greater levels of growth and profitability, and by efficiently divesting or discontinuing non-core assets.","I'll close my remarks on slide 12. We generated nearly $1.1 billion of operating cash flow in the first half of this year, which allowed us to strategically invest in our business and delever to our target of two times debt to EBITDA. We also returned approximately 80% of our first half free cash flow to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. And we now expect to return around $1.4 billion during 2017, which is 40% more than any year in our history. We are well positioned to meet our objectives in 2017 even as we lay the foundation for continued success in 2018 and beyond.","I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A, but for now, I'll hand it over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Thank you, Scott, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'll begin on slide 13.","You've just heard the financial details on both the best quarter and the best first half in our company's history, which builds on the track record that you see here. We grew revenues, margins, earnings and capital return while executing on our strategic agenda.","Our track record demonstrates the durability of our model. We continue to grow and outperform in a range of environments. This includes our growth through the financial crisis, a time of very high market volatility, as well as growth during the first half of this year, a time of historically low market volatility.","At our Investor Day in June, we highlighted our strategic vision for delivering complementary solutions across global markets, which you can see if you move forward to slide 14. Today, we provide more mission critical high-value services than ever, and we're delivering on those across our integrated and widely distributed technology platforms. Our number one priority remains meeting our customer's requirements. These are evolving rapidly due to advances in technology and automation coupled with the demand for efficiency, regulatory compliance, analytical decision-making, and real time information.","Historically, we sought primarily to serve the needs for price discovery and transaction execution. But the expansion of electronic markets and our coverage of virtually all asset classes today has pushed us deeper into data and information services. This is a virtuous cycle, where providing more information to users fuels market liquidity and the ability to transact and to manage risk.","Through the lens of our customers' workflows, we've identified these shifts early in their cycle and expanded our solutions into these growth areas. And while we've primarily focused our attention on our new data segment in our remarks today, we're executing on meaningful opportunities across our global businesses.","On slide 15, we've detailed several of the drivers contributing to both our near-term and long-term growth, and I'll highlight a few of these. You can see how our core exchange business continues to serve as a growth engine through which we deliver related services and expand our proprietary data content and distribution. Starting in the upper left quadrant, the unique technology infrastructure that we've integrated through various acquisitions, such as YellowJacket, NYSE, Interactive Data and TMX Atrium have uniquely positioned ICE to securely distribute our content. By innovating around these assets, we've developed new applications to meet risk managers' needs for their revolving workflow and cyber security.","In the lower left quadrant, you can see the complementary growth across our lines of business. Scott highlighted our leading trading and clearing volume growth year-to-date, our consistent data revenue growth and the fact that we're beginning to execute on new international data sales. As our cross-selling efforts continue, we also expect to see further results from integrating across our markets and information businesses.","On the lower right, you can see that we're also leveraging our unique assets along with making opportunistic acquisitions to serve customers in new ways. In 2018, we expect to complete our work on developing a new digital backbone for MERS and we continue to build liquidity in our inter-dealer bond market offering. And we're delivering more services through ICE Benchmark Administration. Today, we operate benchmarks for LIBOR, the gold price and the ISDA SIMM, among others. As announced last week, we've been awarded a mandate from the LBMA to operate their silver price benchmark. We also expect to begin offering clearing for that daily benchmark in connection with a silver futures contract just as we expanded to clear and trade the gold price benchmark. These are just a few examples of how we're holistically serving more of our customers' trading and risk management needs.","Moving on to slide 16, our clearing infrastructure is an example of how we're continuing to build on our solutions synergistically. Clearing is widely recognized for its central role in managing risk and providing critical settlement information. Today, our global clearing houses serve our customers not only in trading, but by helping to meet their compliance, information and capital efficiency requirements.","In operating our first clearing house a decade ago, we saw the value of market data, which enables us to develop and clear new products. In 2007, we cleared approximately 300 products. Today, that number is over 3,000 products. And this year's launch of our gold and silver contracts is just one more example of how we're leveraging our investments in data and clearing to create opportunities for our customers to trade, make informed decisions and manage risk.","Our global clearing operations are also a key strength for us in addressing the changing regulatory dynamics brought on by Brexit, MiFID II, Basel and the ever evolving regulatory environment. While we continue to advocate for a delay in those parts of MiFID II that we believe increase systemic risk or add significant cost to investors without a commensurate return, there are many ways that we're actually serving the new unbundling, trading, clearing and data acquisition framework that's mandated by this regulation. With our exchanges and clearing houses on a common technology platform in the U.S., the UK, Europe, Canada and Asia, we're confident in our ability to support our customers when and wherever they choose to do business.","Shifting to slide 17, I'll remind you of the growth drivers of our data segment in the quarter, which we also expect will be key drivers in the coming years. It's worth noting that these dynamics are creating demand in our trading and clearing segment as well. Whether it's an asset manager looking to expand its passive investment business, an active manager looking to outperform the benchmarks or a quantitative manager looking to feed an increasing amount of data into its trading engines, we continue to see a long-term pipeline of data demand.","In June, we announced our plans to acquire the Bank of America Global Research index family, which is the second largest fixed income index provider after Barclays. We've innovated in this area, allowing our customers to further benefit from our expanding fixed income evaluated pricing and reference data services and we expect to have roughly $1 trillion of assets under management benchmarked to our fixed income index franchise upon the acquisition's closure, spanning government bonds, munis, corporates, commodities and equity indices.","Together with our suite of pricing, reference data, indexes and exchange-traded fund services, we're increasing the range of solutions that are available to asset managers beyond their traditional providers, particularly as they seek new cost efficient end-to-end solutions.","More broadly on slide 18, we're also rapidly executing on the global demand for our data services. Scott noted the double-digit growth in new contract signings in Europe and Asia during the quarter, which is not yet fully reflected in our reported metrics. We see sales in these areas as a growth opportunity and a solid tailwind. The opportunity in these regions is unique due to the demand for holistic data and information solutions. And because the markets that we serve are global and continue to automate, we're expanding both our sales team and our product sets there.","In closing, on slide 19, I want to acknowledge Kelly Loeffler's role and her track record of success. Shortly after the company's launch, we asked Kelly to organize the firm in a way that would position us to become an NYSE-listed public company. Kelly decided that our company needed a budget and it needed metrics that would allow us to measure and track our performance and that we could no longer fly by the feet of our pans. She determined that we needed an investor massage and an outreach program to share our message with the public. She recognized that I could use a heck of a lot of support both on and off the court.","So today after 51 earnings calls, this is the last time you're going to hear her voice in this venue. The results shown on slide 19 pretty much speak how all this turned out for us and to the competencies that she laid down for us to be a public company.","ICE continues to invest strategically in growth. We refine our portfolio around core assets. We expand our margins. We return more capital as a result of our strong cash flow and we deliver at or ahead of our stated integration plans.","So I'd like to thank our customers for their business and their feedback in the quarter and I'd like to recognize my colleagues at ICE for delivering the best quarter in the company's history. And finally, I'd thank Kelly for giving us the foundation to share this success with all of you here today.","I'm now going to turn the call back to our moderator, Gary, and we're going to conduct a question-and-answer session until 9:30 Eastern Time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Jeff, what are your thoughts on the planned elimination of LIBOR? I guess maybe how does the decision impact ICE directly given your position in the process? And then, I think more interestingly, there's so much tied to LIBOR, maybe from a higher level, where and how do you see the opportunities for ICE to benefit from the pending changes? Thanks.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Sure. Let me take the second half of that question first. We've built this company called ICE Benchmark Administration, which we're really proud of. We stood up a from-scratch entrepreneurial effort to build a bespoke benchmark administrator. And where there are opportunities to administer benchmarks, ICE is pretty much at the front of the line for any new product that comes out. So, while there is talk about potential new interest rate benchmarks that could evolve in the world, I wouldn't roll out the back that ICE Benchmark Administration will have a high likelihood of being the administrator of those benchmarks, given our track record.","The second \u2013 and a little more detail, what today LIBOR is overseen by ICE Benchmark Administration and a large group of market participants that formally meet to contribute to how LIBOR will evolve. And before the financial crisis, it was an estimate provided by the banks. Today, banks still provide IBA with estimates, but they also provide IBA with all of the underlying short-term trading data that they have and the rationale and algorithms that they use to convert that into the LIBOR estimate.","So, what the industry has been doing around LIBOR is correlating all of the short-term data information that it has through real transactions with algorithms and estimates on how LIBOR should be based on those going forward. And that work has largely been done. And there is a high confidence in LIBOR as it exists today, because the market knows that there is a lot of underlying data that's being looked at and correlated into the daily publication of LIBOR. Now regulators have said that they would like it to be specifically based on those short-term transactions. And Ken, let me give you an example of what they're really saying.","You're a very good equity analyst, you're going to listen to our call today. I suspect you'll read all the materials we put out and typically you would write a note to your clients suggesting the valuation of ICE stock and where you think the stock price might perform in the future. And if I ask you to do that same exercise tomorrow and then the next day and then again the following day, largely little would have changed in the world that would cause you to change your estimate unless it was some macroeconomic trend that was impacting ICE.","If I did that same exercise with you and said you must link your estimate to the stock price of ICE's stock today, every day your estimate would move because our stock price could easily move around in a given day. So, you may tell your client today that you think ICE could be a $100-a-share company and tomorrow if the stock price moved, you'd say it was $110, and the day after that you'd say it was $90, then you'd say it was $80, and then it was $200 and whatever. So, one of the complexities of introducing specific algorithmic tie to short-term trading is that the market doesn't use LIBOR in that way. And so the complexity is not tying LIBOR to the underlying movement of rates, it is coming up with the solution that will actually work for the market in doing that. It's a throwaway statement to say things should be more transparent or based on real transactions.","This has to work in the real world and, as you pointed out in your question really, there're trillions of dollars of assets that are tied against that including, as Scott mentioned, the loans that he's going to go into the market and refinance that we use ourselves. And the market is not really ready yet. In the minds of the marketplace, we're overseeing this to put that into full transaction-based mode.","The good news is that the FCA has required the banks to continue to provide that kind of underlying information for the next four years to IBA so that these solutions can be worked on. The regulators are in the room. There're in these meetings. There're aware of these issues. They're aware that there has be to a long transition period. I'm confident that that group is going to solve this problem and figure out a way to introduce these new metrics into the market in a way that will work for the market. Because there is a lot of thought and care going into. But, again, I would reiterate, in the meantime, there is a high level of confidence in the way LIBOR is operating today.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And maybe just as a follow-up. Do you see opportunities for ICE in this change in LIBOR in either the future side, maybe in the U.S., or the OTC side of trading globally? And I'll throw in just a thank you to Kelly for all the help over the years that she has given to me and the rest of investors. Thanks.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Okay. I'll give you a short answer to the second one since I gave you a long answer to the first one and the answer is, yes. We do see those opportunities and we do think there will be additional benchmarks and just in dealing with what I suggested which is a LIBOR that is going to be much more volatile in the future will increase the need for risk management around that.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, guys. Just first question, just on the announcement related to Trayport, just wanted to get your updated thoughts on how that you expect that to play out, any potential impact? And then probably just broader, what it means in terms of M&A strategy and where the areas that you think you still see opportunities versus the areas that apparently appear more complex?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yeah. So, with respect to Trayport itself, I can't get into the details of the process other than to say there's tremendously high interest in the marketplace to be an owner of that company, which is good news for us. And it's important for us that \u2013 and to the regulators, but our interests are aligned in that we want it to be owned by a good operator, so that we can continue to be a potential customer of the company. And so, we have that interest as well as the regulator.","In terms of impact, we'll give you guidance once we know the ultimate outcome of that process and when it might actually be spun out, but we've got nothing right now to say.","Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","And just to be crystal clear, Trayport's assumed in the guidance that we've given you. I suspect it will be an immaterial impact this year. To the extent either of those changes, as Jeff said, we'll give you clear visibility as soon as we're able.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then, I guess, just anything on the M&A front in terms of the outlook, just given that process?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yeah. I would just say that M&A particularly within Europe right now is complicated. It's complicated by Brexit basically and what is the competitive landscape in a post-Brexit Europe and what will the great repeal bill that the UK is adopting ultimately mean for the relationship that the UK will have with Europe. And so in order to do anything that's sort of pan-European, a manager needs to have an outlook on how that's going to unfold, because it will affect the competitive dynamics of how the regulators will look at these things.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Okay. Thanks. Scott, just on the tax rate, is that mix or is there any tax changes impacting that?","Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","It's largely mix. I mean, one of peers mentioned the change in the Illinois State tax, that impacts us a little bit. But the increase that you saw from 1Q to 2Q and then as I mentioned continuing into third quarter is mix to the U.S., in particular a really strong performance by the IDC business, combination of synergies that we're delivering and solid growth that we're seeing. We talked about the EMEA and Asia Pacific signings, which were really good. But as we showed you on Investor Day, over 70% of our business is in the U.S. and that business is doing really well.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks a lot.","Operator","The next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. I guess, Scott, if you could remind us from a synergy expectation kind of what's left? And as you think longer term, the growth rate of the overall total expense base, how we should think about that?","Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Sure. So, we continue to execute on our synergy plan. We told you coming into the year, that we had $100 million to go and then we increased that by $30 million. I said $25 million to $30 million but I think most of you wrote down $30 million. So, we're driving towards that $130 million goal.","We said we'd deliver $60 million this year. I'm very encouraged by the results through the first half with regard to that expectation. I think, more importantly, the $70 million subsequent to that six months later, we've really firmed up the vast majority of the actions that'll deliver those synergies as well.","So, I'm very comfortable with the synergy performance through the first half of the year. I'm confident that we'll continue to deliver on the original $60 million, and possibly generate some upside to that this year. And then again, we've got a full blown roadmap to the full $130 million now. So, I feel good about it.","And your second question, it doesn't end with just the synergies for the acquired businesses. We're constantly focused on ways to run our business more efficiently in the base as well. As you know, comp's about half of our overall expense base, as is demonstrated by the results. Once again, our employee population consistently earns increases on their comp. But that comp is also tied to our performance, and so it self regulates. To the extent we're not delivering, bonuses come down. To the extent we overdeliver, bonuses go up. So, I would expect that that comp expense, as it has over the past couple years, probably grows around 3% or 4%. I generally think the rest of it will be tied to revenue growth because a lot of it is expense, that when we're growing, it contributes like our listings performance right now. That drives some marketing expense, but the revenues more than offset it.","So, I think, over the longer term, what you've seen from us is somewhere between flat to plus 3%. And at least for the foreseeable future, I don't know why you'd have an expectation of more than that. So, I think expenses will continue to be managed in a way that'll allow us to grow profit faster than revenue.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Great. And then just a follow-up on the revenue outlook and wondering if there are any pricing changes in the quarter across either the data side of the business or within transactions, and maybe thinking about that for the remainder of the this year, if there's anything that's kind of in the hopper to come.","Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yeah, so through the year, there's nothing in particular from a pricing standpoint that's driving the results. Right now, what really is driving it are new products, new customers, you see it in our signings results. We mentioned at Inventor Day that pricing is an element of our growth model. I think we said then that it was around 30% and then the debate ensued whether that was too much or too little. But I still think that's a reasonable expectation as you think about next year and the year after and the year subsequent.","But, in this year, what's driving the performance year-to-date is signings, new customers, new products, and we're particularly pleased with the results we're seeing in pricing and analytics, in connectivity and we made a brief mention of it in our prepared remarks, but our feeds business is doing really well.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, guys, for taking the question. Couple of questions this morning. So maybe the first one around just some of the equity market structure dynamics. So Chairman Clayton obviously suggested that the SEC is looking to revisit some of the equity market structure topics, including lowering access fee caps. Jeff, can you guys remind us I guess where do you stand on this issue and what this could mean for NYSE if fee caps are lowered and how that should kind of play out in the business model?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Well, we've suggested that we believe that there is an opportunity to lower those caps. However, it should be done in connection with a broader restructuring of the market so that both lit markets and dark markets are operating under similar types of rules of engagement. Because what you don't want to do \u2013 and you can come up with scenarios where you lower the cap but all you're really doing is incenting people to leave the lit markets.","The rules of engagement in many of the dark pools is not transparent and it's unclear what kinds of fees are being paid there and what kind of incentive programs exist and so on and so forth. And so it has to really be a holistic view. But we would certainly support a holistic review of the markets.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And just a follow-up for Scott. Looking at the annual subscription value metrics that you guys put out, those are helpful. I guess, as we look at the different line items there, pricing, analytics and desktop connectivity obviously seemed to kind of carry the organic growth momentum in the bucket. How does profitability across these services vary? And I guess what I'm trying to get at really is just thinking through the margin implications of some of these areas growing a little bit faster than the others, what does it mean for the data services margin as a whole?","Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yeah. So look, I think the opportunities for the data margin are to continue the trend of expansion. Pricing and analytics and exchange data margin dynamics are really similar. And then I made a comment in my prepared remarks with regards to the fact that each additional dollar of revenue historically in the exchange data business has driven high incremental margins because it's an incremental user of data that it's already produced. It's similar in pricing and analytics. To the extent I've got 10 people that buy a particular bond price and I can then sell it to an 11th, a 12th, a 13th, there's not a lot of incremental expense that comes along with that.","So, incremental margins on pricing and analytics and exchange data are very positive. Connectivity is a little lower only in the sense that that is where it requires some fixed assets, because as we build out capacity to handle more customers or we build, for example, larger ports for those customers to connect to, there's a little more incremental expense that will come with that. That notwithstanding, the incremental margins are still very attractive.","So, I don't view it as a particularly large difference among the three and do believe then across the three \u2013 if we're getting growth regardless of which of the three or all of the three or two of the three it comes from, incremental margins will be solid and will contribute to expanding margins at the bottom line for that segment and for us as a company.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, hey, good morning.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Good morning.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Wanted to just come back to Dan's question on the pricing side. I think, Scott, you answered it on the data side which we've all been focused on, but can you talk a little bit on the transaction side as well? I mean, if you look at this quarter, on a year-over-year perspective, what stands out is on the interest rate side in particular really strong volume growth but the revenues didn't really follow through as much. And I know there was some FX, but it seems like mix is hurting you as well. And I saw you made some changes on the deals pricing a couple months ago and some ag stuff here and there. Just thinking holistically, I mean, is it time that you use your market strength on the transaction side a little bit more to drive pricing upside there as well? I mean, your primary competitor has been doing that for the last few years here and there as well. So, any new thoughts?","Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yeah. So, I give you a couple of thoughts. The first one being that we're outgrowing the competitor you referred to. But the second one is with regards to pricing, FX is clearly affecting financials and so there is no price action to take to address that. That will somewhat self-correct as we move into the fourth quarter. We have had some mix impact in particularly volatile periods and this has always been the case, whether it's volatility that's Brexit driven or European economy driven, we tend to see a mix to heavier liquidity providers or market makers which tend to benefit more from the lower rates. The same thing is true in energy, where in oil we've seen volatility and a mix of a bit more of the market makers.","We did see in June a little bit bigger dip than we had anticipated. We went back to the drawing board and redesigned some of the market making programs in both energy and financials and saw marked improvement in July RPC versus June. You won't see it in what we reported, because we report a three month rolling average and so effectively June, it will take all quarter to roll the impact of June out. But I will tell you and I'll give you specifically within our energy RPC, we were up 4% or 5% in energy in the month of July versus the month of June. And so as that rolls through to the whole quarter with the volume growth that continued year to year, it's a good arbiter of what we expect in terms of an ability to continue to grow our trading revenues.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Great. Thank you. And then on the data side, maybe on one specific area, I mean, yesterday you had the announcement with T. Rowe on the real time evaluated pricing. I think that's been an area of focus in the past. Can you just help us how to think about that opportunity going forward. I mean, I know you're not going to be specific about T. Rowe, but as you think about the addressable market, the number of asset managers or banks that really you're targeting or should be targeting, then how big the range of revenues could be for a typical asset manager or bank, so we can start dreaming a little bit about that potential business here?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","So, I'll just sort of highlight really what we're seeing and it was really written through our prepared remarks. But there is \u2013 a data strategy today needs to think about these macro trends and the more you can set this sail of your boat into these winds, the better you're going to do. And that's really how we've been trying to focus the business. The first is that there's a movement away from these large multi-asset class screens to data provided on feeds that are feeding bespoke applications, quantitative algorithms, and other kinds of things. So, there's a move from screens to feeds.","There is more growth, we believe, in EMEA and Asia than in the United States. So, you need a distribution system that will get you to other geographies for us as Americans. There is a fundamental change going on in high frequency trading in the United States. It is no longer \u2013 the flash boys kind of phenomena in my mind is being arbitraged out of the market. Exchanges have been changing their policies and systems and brokers and customers have been changing their algorithms in the way they approach markets. And so, the kind of high frequency trader that's demanding data today is slightly different than the one in the past. They're more quantitatively oriented and need data in ways that kept them drive those kind of quantitative algorithms.","There's fragmentation going on. Wherever there are markets where there's fragmentation, customers want to reassemble the market. And so, the areas where you see more fragmentation, you see our revenues growing faster. And lastly, as Scott and I pointed out, there is a lot of new regulation coming on that are really putting pressure on end users to take the kind of products that you mentioned, Alex, and use those in their workflow to make sure that they're getting best execution.","So if you think about our strategy, the way we're thinking about our strategy is how do we get our sales in each of those wins and we do have a solution for all of those and it's why for the first time in the history of our company, Scott has been guiding to real substantial revenue growth that we think we can sustain over a long period of time.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Ben Herbert with Citi. Please go ahead.","Ben Herbert - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask, we've been hearing a little bit more from ETF sponsors around self-indexing and wanted to get your perspective on conversations or how you think that might impact your business there?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","We're actively involved with a lot of people in those kinds of conversation. So I would affirm that what you're hearing is what we're hearing. We have announced pretty publicly some major transactions with BlackRock on fixed income ETFs.","We're in a very good position because we as a company, I don't really care whether we license you an index that's tied to AUM or whether you create an index or we create an index for you, but underlying is our data, which you'll acquire. In other words, whether you acquire the index from us, which we can calculate and use our data or whether you acquire the data and do it yourself, we're agnostic. And so it puts us in a unique position vis-\u00e0-vis many of the indexers to have these kinds of conversations with end users.","We have the calculation engines. We have the data, we have the reference data that underlies that. We have a very good brand in the name of New York Stock Exchange. We have the listings venue. And so, all of that can go into a conversation on how we can help you. And those are conversations that we're having across the industry.","Ben Herbert - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. And then just maybe a follow-up on fixed income ETFs specifically and how you might or how you might size or think about the listings opportunity off that?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","I think ETFs for fixed income are popular and on the rise and it's simply because it's hard for you and I as individual investors to acquire and own bonds. And to the extent that you want fixed income in your retirement account or portfolio, you're going to want some diversity of types of bonds. And what we are seeing is wealth managers are preferring to allow professionals to put those portfolios of bonds together and offer them to the market in a low-cost manner through an ETF. And so, I really do think that that's an area on the rise.","It's an area that if you are an ETF provider, you can differentiate yourselves. It's somewhat hard to differentiate yourself if you're simply using a broad market-based equity index because most of your competitors will offer those. In fixed income, with so many SKUs that exist in the world, you can put together different kinds of portfolios, different kinds of metrics that can differentiate you from your peers and so we see a lot of work going on there. We're providing a lot of underlying data and analytics to ETF providers as they think about how to find niches in the market.","Ben Herbert - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Please go ahead.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First one is really on the corporate bond business. I know at the Investor Day you pretty clearly laid out the fact that ICE is focusing on the institutional dealer to dealer corporate bond market, but just given some of the recent press on retail bond trading platform for sale. I'm just wondering given the collection of assets you have, including NYSE bonds, could you just give us an update on how you view or how core you view the retail space for you or is the focus right now on growing the institutional side?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","It's a good question. We are really looking at the fact that we kind of have this core fixed income data and distribution infrastructure and then we think about are there other products or services that we could add to that network that would be accretive. And to the extent that we were to acquire something, will have returns above our cost of capital that would outperform other uses of our capital such as share buybacks. So I think, long story short, we're opportunistic. We look at anything that is available as a buy versus build, but in the background we're also considering how we use capital and what we can build ourselves.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And then just a follow-up, just more of a cleanup question for Scott. The $480 million to $490 million adjusted expense guide for 3Q, just wanted to confirm does that already reflect the sale of NYSE Governance Services or should we model that on top of the guidance?","Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","It already reflects it.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, folks. Maybe, Jeff, just to go back to the LIBOR, I guess, the debate about the benchmark. How do you view, as you mentioned, hundreds of trillions of dollars of loans and securities are linked to the rate. I guess, how do you view the process of untangling that in the loans and securities and benchmarking that to a different rate? Is that something that's going to be sort of prohibitive and therefore keep LIBOR going well beyond 2021 or is it something that's easier to fix? And then if you could just comment how you think it's going to impact your Euribor franchise on the (50:01).","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Sure. So I think one misunderstanding is that we publish 35 LIBOR rates. The alternatives that both the U.S. Fed and the Bank of England have proposed have a single overnight rate. The single overnight rate is the \u2013 in other words, the overnight LIBOR is the least used of the 35 rates that we put out. The market can't use those as a substitute as they exist today. What really needs to happen is confidence in the entire 35 rate portfolio of LIBOR across its entire pricing curve with underlying transactions that are much broader than overnight rates. And so I don't think it can be substituted as it's discussed right now. The only and my own view is, it's going to be easier to continue to build confidence in LIBOR than it will be to build 35 new rates that over a period of years that the market is prepared to substitute.","Some of the efforts of the central banks are already feeding into the work that the LIBOR oversight committee is doing. And so, it's helpful in that sense, but one should understand that if there was a good substitute, the market would have already substituted it. We wouldn't need to have the debate, but there is not a good substitute. Something needs to transition and improve in order to continue to build confidence. And I think ICE Benchmark Administration has the infrastructure to do that.","And so, we'll see how that plays out. But we didn't start this work today, we've been doing this now for the last few years. So there is a very, very deep-rooted effort going on and a head of steam on how to do these replacements. The point that I made earlier is that even any transaction-based substitute is going to have more volatility in it. And the market has to figure out how to work around that.","Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","And Jeff noted it earlier, but, again, I've got a bank facility that's a five-year facility that as we start to think about our refinancing, it will include LIBOR as the base. So while the people who trade LIBOR at the banks may be talking about what they'd like to see as replacement, the people who are out helping firms like ours raise capital are still embedding LIBOR in their agreements for long periods of time.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Right. So, this whole thing was going to play out a lot longer than 2021 it sounds like.","Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Absolutely. I can't imagine that the number of corporate deals that have been struck around LIBOR that will have to be renegotiated and I can imagine how I'm going to feel if a bank comes to me and suggests that I need to go hire lawyers and pay them to help me renegotiate just around that fact.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Right, right. Great point. Okay, and then just as a follow-up, maybe just go back to the data business. Jeff, you really outlined well I think some of the long-term growth drivers just in that response to a couple questions ago. As we think about, I guess, the organic data revenue growth of 4% year-over-year is how do you think about that accelerating? I think you were talking, of course, at the Investor Day of more longer-term mid-to-high single-digit potential. Do you think we'll begin to see that in 2018 with some of the themes that you mentioned, Jeff, including MiFID II?","Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","So let me start and then Jeff can jump in. I wouldn't get too hung up on the 4% given that, as we noted, pricing and analytics was up 5%, desktops and connectivity was up 7%. And if you peel back the exchange data, that was largely a phenomena for the NYSE, which was down 5% year-to-year, while our commodities part was up 7%. So I would argue that embedded in the 4% is, if you will, a very narrow issue around NYSE data and the rest of the business is performing right in the middle of the mid to high single digits that we guided. And so we delivered it last year. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're going to deliver it again this year at 6%.","And I do think particularly with the strength of the signings that we will deliver it again in 2018 and are positioned, based upon the model we showed you at Investor Day, to do it continuing. And again, it's based on new products and all the dynamics that Jeff talked about in Europe around MiFID and best execution. It's a growing presence in Asia Pacific which is the fastest-growing region and it's really a single sales team selling across the breadth of the products we have in the Americas. So, we feel good about the rest of this year. We felt good about the quarter, and I think we are well positioned to hit that mid-to-high single-digits growth into the future.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","And the NYSE data phenomena is that during periods of very low volatility, more business during the day goes into the dark pools because the market isn't that volatile, which then affects how the data revenues and messages to the exchange and the way data revenues are allocated. It's a phenomenon that isn't specific to NYSE, specific to all exchanges.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, guys. Another one on data. Europe tends to be a little bit more of a mature market and you guys showed that the industry overall, the growth about 1%. But you guys are seeing 18% growth there on contract signings, which is really just obviously very strong. Can you comment a little bit on why your growth is so strong there in EMEA versus the industry on average?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yeah, I would say at the end of the day, there's specific requirements under MiFID that are driving end users to change their workflow. So, as we pointed out with the press release that we had with T. Rowe, we have products that allow people to assure that they're getting best execution in the fixed income space. That's popular.","Secondly, people are bracing for more fragmentation as a result of MiFID. When fragmentation happens, the wallet increases as people try to put the market back together. I mean, in fairness, we advocate that there shouldn't be fragmentation. We think it's bad for risk management. But it's good for revenues. And we're talking out of both sides of our mouths, honestly. But I tend to think that the more we can do to help customers, the better we'll be in the long term, which is why we're advocating against fragmentation. But we're doing well as a result of it.","I think this trend is going to continue, there's a lot of people that are unprepared for MiFID. We're going on sales calls and cold calling people to talk about these things and they look at us like we have three eyes and don't understand what it is we're talking about. I think there's going to be quite a lagging impact. And given the uncertainty around MiFID that's going to be caused by Brexit, I think that that trend is going to be in the market for many years.","Operator","The next question comes from Vincent Hung with Autonomous. Please go ahead.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Hi, good morning. So I'll give this a shot. How much revenue do you generate from indices now pro forma for the recent index acquisition?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","How much revenue we generate \u2013 Vincent, say the last part of your question again.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","From indices now, pro forma for the recent acquisition.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","I assume you're referring to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch. That deal hasn't closed yet. So that hasn't impacted our revenues at all and we haven't to this point broken out indices as a separate line item in revenue.","Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","But to be clear, the reason that we're interested in the Bank of America indices is that we would want to fuel them with underlying ICE data. So Bank of America has been making that transition while they own them so that when those indices come to us that they'll be potentially all on ICE data. So whether we license the index or sell the data, we're kind of agnostic honestly.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Sprecher for any closing remarks.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Well, thank you, operator, and thank you all for joining us today and so we'll look forward to updating you as we work to close out the year and hope that we can continue to talk to you about building on this record performance that we had in this quarter and in the half.

I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Warren Gardiner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Warren Gardiner","Good morning. ICE\u2019s fourth quarter 2019 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay.","Today\u2019s call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements which we undertake no obligation to update represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties.","For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2019 Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC.","In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including adjusted income, EPS, operating income, operating margin, expenses, effective tax rate, free cash flow and debt to adjusted EBITDA. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance.","To find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP term in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful, as well as how management uses these measures in our 10-Q.","When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain terms.","With us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Ben Jackson, our President.","I will now turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Hill","Thanks, Warren. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I will begin on slide four with some of the key highlights from our solid fourth quarter and record 2019 results. Fourth quarter net revenue totaled $1.3 billion driven by Trading and Clearing revenues of $626 million and Data and Listing s revenues of $672 million. Within Data and Listing s, Data Services revenues totaled $559 million, up 4% on a constant currency basis. For the full year, data services revenues grew 5% on a constant currency basis.","Adjusted operating expenses totaled $570 million in the fourth quarter and adjusted earnings per share increased year-over-year to $0.95. For the full year, adjusted EPS were $3.88, up 8% versus 2018. We have grown adjusted EPS every single year since we first listed on the New York Stock Exchange 14 years ago. 2019 operating cash flows of $2.7 billion were up 5% versus 2018, yielding record free cash flow of $2.3 billion.","Turning to slide five, you can see that we returned nearly 90% of that $2.3 billion to shareholders, 19% more than in the prior year. This record $2.1 billion of capital return was more than double, the amount we return the year prior to our acquisition of IDC in 2015.","And importantly, we did all of this while maintaining our target leverage and investing in key strategic initiatives across our trading, data, fixed income, mortgage and digital asset networks. As we turn to 2020, we remain committed to continuing to grow our capital return as we grow.","Our Board recently authorized a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend. We have grown the dividend roughly 14% a year since 2013, while over the same period, adjusted EPS have grown around 15%.","Our Board also approved a 20% increase in our share repurchase authorization to $2.4 billion, which will allow us to increase our quarterly buyback level to around $400 million, while also providing capacity to act opportunistically.","Now let\u2019s move to slide six, where I will provide an overview of the performance of our Trading and Clearing segment. Trading and Clearing revenue totaled $626 million in the fourth quarter, down 4% on a constant currency basis.","In energy, while fourth quarter revenues were down 5% versus a strong fourth quarter of last year, full year revenues grew 4% on a constant currency basis. This record performance was driven by strong growth in higher RPC products, such as our Dutch natural gas contracts or TTF, in addition to other crude and refined products.","Importantly, the open interest that built throughout 2019, as anticipated, translated in the strong volumes in January, with record energy ADV up 29% year-over-year improved RPC and open interest up 12% versus the prior year period.","In our Ag markets, fourth quarter revenues increased 5% year-over-year, including strength in cocoa, coffee and cotton. 2020 is also off to a strong start with January volumes increasing 30% year-over-year increasing RPC and open interest approaching record levels and up 14% year-over-year.","In our Financial Futures Complex, fourth quarter revenues were down 13%, driven primarily by lower interest rate volumes. However, sterling open interest ended the year up 20% and is up 36% at the end of January, volumes grew 72% in January and RPC was stable.","Finally, in our Fixed Income and Credit businesses, revenues totaled $96 million in the fourth quarter. This compares to $83 million last year and includes a full quarter of Simplifile, which we acquired in June of last year.","Next on slide seven, I will discuss the Data and Listing segment. Fourth quarter Data Services revenue totaled a record $559 million, up 4% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. This marks the 40th consecutive quarter of year-over-year Data Services revenue growth. For the full year, revenues grew 5% at constant currency and landed right in the middle of the range we provided a year ago.","Fourth quarter growth in Pricing and Analytics was 4% on a constant currency basis. A challenging business environment in Europe partially offset solid growth in North America, accelerating growth in Asia-Pacific and double-digit growth in our Index business.","We expect the impact from the challenges in Europe to persist through the first quarter, after which we anticipate absolute revenue and growth in Pricing and Analytics will accelerate yielding 5% to 6% growth for the full year.","Exchange Data and Feeds grew 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, driven by solid growth in Futures Data, offset by softer trends at the NYSE.","Desktops and Connectivity growth with 7% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and similar to the last few quarters was driven by strong performance in our ICE Global Network offering, where network capacity grew 14% versus the prior year.","Finally, in our Listings business, revenues totaled $113 million in the fourth quarter. The NYSE listed 12 IPOs during the quarter and 58 for the full year. During 2019, the NYSE helped customers raise a total of nearly $112 billion of capital, ranking first globally in total capital raised for the ninth consecutive year.","I will conclude my remarks on slide eight with some 2020 guidance. We expect 2020 Data revenues to be in the range of $2.29 to $2.33 billion. This includes revenues of $560 million to $565 million in the first quarter and assumes further sequential improvement in terms of both dollars and growth each quarter as we move through the year.","Moving to expenses, we anticipate full year adjusted operating expenses between $2.275 billion and $2.325 billion. As I noted on our third quarter call, you need to add roughly $50 million to the 2019 base to account for Simplifile, the reclass of certain licensing expenses and a few one-time items that we highlighted as we move through the year.","Off that base and very consistent with prior years, compensation expenses will increase by $30 million to $40 million. Expenses related to revenue growth are expected to increase by $15 million to $25 million.","And finally, we will make $20 million to $30 million in incremental investments in our technology platforms, as well as key growth initiatives, such as ICE Futures Abu Dhabi and Bakkt. These investments will be largely funded by $15 million to $25 million of expense efficiencies.","Finally, we expect $570 million to $580 million in the first quarter for expenses, including around $5 million of severance, which we do not expect to recur in later quarters.","In summary, we delivered a solid finish to another record year. We once again grew revenues, operating income, free cash flow and capital return. And at the same time, we invested across our business and are well-positioned to once again meet the needs of our customers grow the top and bottomline, and deliver enhanced shareholder returns during 2020 and beyond.","I will be happy to take your questions during Q&A, but for now, I will hand it to Jeff to expand on some of our strategic initiatives as we enter the New Year.","Jeff Sprecher","Thank you, Scott, and good morning to everyone on the call. Please turn to slide nine. 2019 marked our 14th consecutive year of record revenues and record adjusted earnings per share. It\u2019s a track record that reflects the quality of our strategy, and more importantly, the execution of that strategy.","As growth opportunities emerge around the world, it\u2019s our technology, expertise and culture that enable us to quickly and efficiently capture these opportunities. It\u2019s an approach that empowers product innovation and it\u2019s a proven model that\u2019s yielded both consistent growth and shareholder value creation.","In our natural gas markets, sale and production in North America is surging, while legacy LNG contracts across Asia are unwinding. Similar to the evolution of crude oil markets a number of years ago, the liberalization of natural gas is driving demand for a globally recognized benchmark.","And our European Natural Gas complex led by our TTF contract is quickly emerging as the Brent of natural gas with average daily volume up over 100% in 2019 and up 56% on average annually over the last five years.","As liberalization takes hold, what were once regional markets such as European TTF and our Japan, Korea marker called JKM, are becoming increasingly interconnected in global in nature and it\u2019s this evolution that drove record natural gas revenues up 16% year-over-year in 2019.","In our oil markets, we have invested in building our global platform. Today, our oil complex spans over 600 products, including locational spreads, product spreads, refining spreads and products that are built-off our benchmark energy contracts, such as Brent Crude and Gas Oil.","We continue to invest in our Energy business. During the fourth quarter, we announced the formation of ICE Futures Abu Dhabi, known as IFAD. In November, the Abu Dhabi Supreme Petroleum Council announced plans to lift designation restrictions on Murban crude, allowing barrels to move more freely and the price against our futures contract, which we plan to launch later this year subject to regulatory approval. Murban crude is a highly fungible and sought after grade of oil and it\u2019s utilized by a wide range of global customers, including over 60 refineries in the Asia-Pacific region.","As we have done in the past, we are applying our blueprint for building new marketplaces by partnering with key industry participants, such as the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company as well as nine of the world\u2019s largest trading firms, including Shell, BP, Vitol and Petro China.","Leveraging ICE\u2019s current technology and infrastructure, the Murban crude contract is expected to clear alongside of our global oil business at ICE Clear Europe, bringing capital efficiencies the customers that are underpinned by our flagship Brent Crude oil and low sulfur gas oil contracts as well as our leading Asian oil complex.","Our performance in the global energy market is a product of the investments that we have made, some more than a decade ago and our commitment to staying close to our customers. It\u2019s an approach that permeates this organization creating long-term relationships and helping to drive effective and efficient product innovation.","This approach is also important to our data business, where we are uniquely positioned to leverage our distribution and our infrastructure to create new content and to expand the breadth of our multi-asset class offering.","For example, in early January, we announced that we will be rolling out a suite of new ESG solutions, including climate risk analytics and ESG Reference Data. Leveraging our current infrastructure and reference to data expertise, customers will soon have access to terms and conditions on nearly 500 ESG data points, such as our company\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions or its board diversity metrics. This will not be a rating and we will not be providing any opinion.","Instead, we will provide our customers with a standardized set, consisting of the critical information they need to better assess ESG risks and to establish more precise investment parameters.","In addition, our new climate analytics fueled in part by our leading pricing and reference data will help customers better understand and quantify key ESG investment factors, such as wildfire, flood and hurricane risks.","And while we returned a record $2.1 billion of capital to shareholders in 2019, which was a nearly 20% increase from the last year, we also continue to invest in our early-stage growth initiatives across mortgages, ETFs and digital assets.","Starting at ICE Mortgage Services, we benefited from strong refinancing trends, as well as the continued adoption of digital mortgage solutions. While still a small part of the overall U.S. mortgage originations at less than 1% over 120,000 e-notes were created in 2019, nearly eight times our 2018 total.","In addition, MERS saw a nearly 30% increase in the number of e-registered users in 2019 and it\u2019s Simplifile e-recording volumes also set a record transmitting over 17 million documents through our network in 2019, up 22% year-over-year.","Also, in October, we launched our ETF Hub and shortly thereafter added fixed income capabilities. As we have noted on prior calls, our first phase is focused on building the network, by adding authorized participants known and the industry as APs, as well as additional ETF sponsors.","Through the end of January, we were pleased to announce that we now have four APs that are actively using the platform, made up of JP Morgan, Bank of America, Citadel and Virtu, marking an important step towards building liquidity in primary trading, which is otherwise known as the ETF create redeem process.","In addition, over 70 of BlackRock\u2019s fixed income ETFs have utilized the platform so far, one that now represent the vast majority of BlackRock\u2019s fixed income ETF assets under management. And in fact, yesterday, we announced the acquisition of Bridge2 Solutions, a platform that we believe will accelerate the second phase of our digital asset strategy.","A little more than a year ago, we outlined our future plans for Bakkt. Our mission was to build a broader ecosystem to support the full life cycle of a digital asset. We began by building a regulated bitcoin custody solution, as well as launching regulated futures and options on bitcoin, all to enable greater price transparency and to provide institutions with a trusted regulatory framework.","In late October, we announced that we will be launching a new consumer app, serving as a wallet for a broad array of digital assets, now from airline miles to hotel points to crypto currencies, users will be able to seamlessly manage, convert and transact across this platform. Aligning our historical B2B platform with these new B2C solutions, will position Bakkt as an aggregator and a marketplace for a broad set of digital assets.","Our acquisition of Bridge2 Solutions will be an important part of accelerating these initiatives. Bridge2 supports roughly 4500 different loyalty incentive and employee perks programs across a broad range of industries, including the loyalty and rewards programs of seven of the top 10 US financial institutions. Together, these initiatives will expand Bakkt\u2019s presence across an asset class that today stands at over $1 trillion in value.","Now let\u2019s turn to slide 10. 2019 was another record year at ICE and as we move into 2020, we are focused on applying our expertise and our technology to drive transparency and efficiency for our customers and create value for our stockholders.","As I wrap up my prepared remarks, I want to thank Chuck Vice for the immense contribution he has made to ICE for the last 20 years. While not as much a presence on the calls these days, Chuck has been mission critical to setting our strategy, executing on our growth initiatives and importantly shaping our culture for our younger generation of managers. Chuck will officially stay on as an adviser to me into 2022, but his impact on ICE will undoubtedly extend well beyond that.","I also want to thank our customers for their business and their trust in 2019, and I want to thank my colleagues for the efforts that they have contributed to yet another record year for ICE.","And finally, if you allow me to I\u2019d like to share my thoughts on how we think about shareholder value creation. ICE has a long history of creating shareholder value and we have done so by thinking outside the box and by engaging in value accretive transactions, building partnerships and delivering on organic growth opportunities that others have not considered or did not have the vision or ability to successfully execute.","We have for many years held an internal bimonthly meeting with ICE senior management to kick around new ideas on how to engage with third parties or respond to third party inquiries, which could culminate in business combinations or licenses or partnerships or even ICE divestitures. In fact, our routine part of our quarterly meetings with our Board of Directors is to discuss the best of these ideas to gain for their input.","We look to be opportunistic and we hold such meetings to develop new ideas in order to exploit the talents in the technologies, the capabilities and the assets that we have already assembled for the benefit of our shareholders. One only has to look at our 2019 results and our 2020 guidance to see the power inherent in our current platform.","We have and we always will take a disciplined approach to acquisitions. It\u2019s an opportunistic and proactive approach that does not preclude, but instead encourages exploratory conversations and thought, alongside of our rigorous analysis. And it is that\u2019s approach that has resulted in a long track record of value creation for our shareholders as demonstrated today here on this slide 10. ","When we started ICE our goal was to build an online marketplace, one that would match buyers and sellers of electric power. Back then, I sought out an opportunity to visit eBay to meet with its CEO, Meg Whitman. I was in search of advice on how to build an online marketplace, something that she was uniquely positioned to offer me, given the similarities between our business models.","After all, we both match buyers and sellers, we both collect an organized data, we both work with third parties to provide physical distribution, we both build useful analytics to enhance the transaction experience and there were clear parallels between new ideas in the market for centralized clearing, which we didn\u2019t have at the time and an Internet based PayPal.","While our respective marketplaces serve different customer basis, there are still marketplaces and there is much to be gleaned from similar businesses that operate in different industries, different regions and different customer verticals.","In the case of our recent statement related to eBay, like, many other firms that we converse with, the company for reasons of its own was not interested in delving into the range of ideas that we hope to engage with them on, and thus, we are not able to move forward or validate whether any of our ideas have any true merit.","Ordinarily, we would just keep an open dialog, in the hopes that our paths would cross at a more fortuitous time, but press leaks that suggested there was some imminent business combination has required us to clarify the current situation.","And with that now, I am going to turn the call back to our moderator, Rocco, and he will conduct the question-and-answer session for us until 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s first question comes from Rich Repetto of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.","Rich Repetto","Yeah. Good morning, Jeff, Scott. So, first thank you for the remarks at the conclusion of the prepared remarks. I think, Jeff, everybody looks at you as the most innovative guy in the space, the true visionary in the exchange space at least I do anyway. But I think most of us got caught off guard by the media reports and I know you have made some of the connections just in the prepared remarks, but where I think this caught a little more attention than the normal is that the size of the transaction, the media saying it was over $30 billion, that being almost 60% of your market cap. So I guess the question is, can you say anything to that magnitude of a transaction? And then, maybe if it is true, then just go deeper into the connection that you saw it, and I know you did some of that in the prepared remarks? But why -- what do you see the value here in EBIT, what\u2019s the angle?","Jeff Sprecher","Sure. Well, I want to be respectful to eBay, because they are not engaged with us and to a certain degree it\u2019s kind of like a question where you asked me we are standing out in front of my neighbors house and you say if you own that house, how would you redecorate their living room and I was raised to not do that and I also want to have a good relationship with my neighbor. So, I don\u2019t really want to talk about their business too much.","But I guess, I was surprised that the market views, just the inquiry as being so unique. This company was for probably more than a decade run by Devon Winnick, who many people on this call know, because prior to that job, Devon ran and built a company that\u2019s now known as Refinitiv, which is a foreign exchange trading platform and a large data distribution network and a company that is now under acquisition by the London Stock Exchange of peer of ours in the industry.","And as Devon advanced above the operation of the eBay marketplace to run all of eBay, he was replaced by a fellow known as Scott Cutler. Scott Cutler prior to that job was the right hand of Duncan Niederauer and worked for us at the New York Stock Exchange and now is running a exchange e-commerce platform, Unicorn known as StockX.","So the idea that we would reach out to people who I know, who many of you on the phone know, to talk about whether or not there are parallels between their business and our business. I didn\u2019t think is particularly shocking in outrageous. But out of respect to the company, they have their own ideas and agendas and their new CEO, Scott Schenkel is dealing with a lot of activity in inbounds with Actavis in their stock and so I want to be respectful of him and the decisions that they are going to make on how they are going to run their business.","But that being said, I think, Rich, in your world, you have the analysts that look at exchanges and data companies as a vertical and look at e-commerce platforms and technology companies as a vertical. And you think of those as being in two different atmospheres, in two different verticals.","But for more than a decade, the Board of Directors of eBay, at least in my view as an engineer looked at their company largely as one that had more synergies and characteristics of what comes out of the exchange world, then the e-commerce world and I am not sure that it\u2019s been fair for the market to hold eBay accountable as an e-commerce company and compare it to the likes of Amazon.","And whether or not it should be viewed as a 25-year old cash market for collectible goods, which looks a lot more like the New York Stock Exchange than Amazon and that curiosity and the fact that we know people there led us to open a dialog and that\u2019s kind of the end of the story. So, hopefully, that helps to characterize some of the confusion out there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today comes from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Ken Worthington","Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Maybe, Scott, on the third quarter call, you said that pricing and analytics revenue and growth would approve again in 4Q on a workflow automation and shift to passive in fixed income. Revenue did grow, but just $1 million and growth fell sequentially from 3Q to 4Q from 5% constant currency to 4% constant currency and you -- again in your prepared remarks said that growth would improve throughout 2020. So maybe why did we see the growth rate fall in 4Q rather than rise? And help us get confidence that the trend will kind of reverse and improve throughout this year? Thanks.","Scott Hill","Yeah. That\u2019s a great question, Ken, and a fair one, because I also said on the second quarter call that I thought the pricing and analytics business would see a stronger fourth quarter than we saw. Let me start with the good news.","Number one, I think, the key metric that we look at is ASV and from an AVP standpoint, we entered the year with pricing and analytics at 5%. And I will come back to why I think that\u2019s going to get better, so that\u2019s an encouraging fact.","Our growth in North America in Pricing And Analytics has been very solid around 5% to 6% for the last three years and we expect that will continue as we move into the year. Asia growth or growth in Asia, which I will admit is only 5% to 6% of the revenues, really took off last year.","And it took off, because as we move through \u201818 and \u201819, we recognized that in a much more disaggregated market, an extended sales team was necessary and so we started to make those investments in \u201818, they don\u2019t immediately hit the ground running.","But as we move through the back half of \u201819, we saw the productivity of that sales team really grow, the revenue growth really start to take-off and so the investments in \u201818, the hiring in \u201819 and the intent to continue to hire in \u201820, all of which is reflected in our expense guidance, gives us a lot of confidence that Asia growth will continue to accelerate as well.","Europe is really where we saw the slowdown in 2019 and I think, there are couple of factors that are at play. One is, Europe is a fairly uncertain business environment right now and so we saw customers who had been doing a lot of work, getting ready for various regulatory changes in \u201818 and \u201817 before it really paused in \u201819, try and figure out what is Brexit going to mean to me? What are the next decisions I am going to make? If I am in the U.K. what rules and regulations, I am subject to? If I am in Europe, how might this change? If I have am both in U.K. and Europe, what changes might exist as well? So, we did see a bit of a pause with customers as we move through \u201819. Again, none of that was new, we were seeing it as we move through the year.","In addition, we made some changes in Europe related to our pricing and billing to try and get the more of a global standard approach and we saw some impact from that, some customer confusion over some of those changes and that\u2019s really where I missed the call on the fourth quarter.","We ended up having again some lower consumption in the fourth quarter and even some credits that we issue that impacted revenue negatively in the fourth quarter, that I just didn\u2019t see coming, not because I wasn\u2019t aware of the changes, but I just didn\u2019t anticipate the impact that we would see.","Good news is that\u2019s behind us and as I said in my prepared remarks, a little bit of that challenge persist into the first quarter, but from there we think growth accelerates and then you ask the question, why should we be confident about that, the reason you ought to be confident about that is because just like we did in Asia, we have really been making a big investment in European sales force.","We added 10% to the sales team last year, we are going to add another 16% this year again, all reflected in the expense guidance I gave you. Every one of those sales resources will immediately be positively productive, meaning they will generate more revenue than expense and the overall sales team will generate productivity around 6%, 7% this year.","And so, investments in the sales team that we started last year, will continue this year and I am confident having been at recently the sales kick-off, that team is very motivated to turn the growth story around and with a lot of these customer challenges behind us, I am confident they can do it.","The other thing that gives me a lot of confidence is Brexit behind us and now, customers are going to have to figure out, all right, now that I know Brexit is done, I have entered the world where I need to get back to work on making our business better and we think we have a lot of data offerings that can make our customers\u2019 businesses better.","New products will play a big part. We have recently talked about and Jeff did in his prepared remarks, our ESG offering. As you know, Ken, ESG is far more mature in Europe and so customers will be looking at those products, I think in a positive way and I think that will generate growth in the back half of the year.","And so if you take all those factors into consideration, I missed the fourth quarter and I missed it twice. But the challenges that resulted in the credits that lowered revenue in the fourth quarter again are behind us, the investments in the sales team, the new product innovation, the fact that Brexit is behind us, all that gives me confidence that Europe will rebound and as it does, in dollars and in growth terms, overall pricing and analytics will as well and I fully anticipate that we will see 5% to 6% growth in the pricing and analytics business in 2020, which again is consistent, that business has grown about 6% on average over the last three years and we think it will again this year.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Alex Kramm of UBS. Please go ahead.","Alex Kramm","Sorry to stay on the same topic, as Ken just now, on the data, you sound fairly optimistic, but your commentary was all about pricing analytics. If I look about at your overall guidance for data, I think you also commented on the last call to 4% to 6% overall for 2020. I don\u2019t want to stretch here too much, but I think we are going to calculate your guidance, I think 3.6 to 5.4 FX is helping you I think this year. So are you essentially taking that 2020, 4% to 6% off the table and it\u2019s more like, I don\u2019t know, 4% to 5% or where do we end up, so maybe a little bit more commentary about some of the other challenges or tough comps that you are facing in the other businesses, please?","Scott Hill","Yes, it\u2019s a good question. This one though, I am going to take credit for having said it correct last quarter. What I mentioned last quarter, is that I was confident that the pricing and analytics business will grow 5% to 6%, I just reiterated that I said I thought we would see solid connectivity growth of around 4%, which again over the last three years on average is about what we have seen capacity, as I said, was up 14% last year, we anticipate it\u2019s going to be up 8% this year. I am very confident in that business and what I said is I thought if you added all that together without me saying anything about the exchange data business, we would be in the 4% to 6% range, and I mentioned consistent with our model.","I think the math you did is exactly right. I think if you look at the midpoint of our guidance and where the street is right now, it aligns perfectly. The challenge that we have got on the exchange data side, we have seen softness related to the exchange data at NYSE and as you know from following the company as long as you have, on the exchange data side, we don\u2019t tend to see necessarily meaningful growth every single year, you know, every 18 to 24 months as we add product, as we find opportunities to capture value in our pricing, we do that.","There\u2019s not a lot of price change that is coming through the exchange data side for the futures business in 2020 and so if you roll all that together, very strong performance in pricing and analytics as it rebounds from some of the challenges in Europe, I mentioned continued strong demand for capacity, which I have indicated to you, I believe, is the leading indicator just like open interest is for future revenue growth out in \u201821 and \u201822 and beyond, so solid performance in the connectivity business is capacity growth and the challenges in the exchange data space that I don\u2019t think would surprise any of you listening to the call.","Jeff Sprecher","Alex, this is Jeff, let me just iterate on that last point because I have mentioned in prior calls, and I want to highlight again for you that at the Securities and Exchange Commission, there is a group of people that have tried to use the rule-making process to lower the fees for equity exchange data, it\u2019s had just the opposite impact which has paralyzed the exchange data pricing debate. You know, there are lawsuits going on rule makings, new filing, so on and so forth. ","This just sort of freezes time and will in my mind for a very long time going forward as lawsuits are litigated and appealed and what have you. So as Scott is putting a model together and as management is thinking about revenue opportunities there, we just basically say a kind of is going to be, what it\u2019s going to be, I don\u2019t expect it to go up, I don\u2019t expect to go down, it\u2019s really pretty frozen and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily the intent of the customers that have been trying to advocate for this, because it\u2019s frozen in a sense that we couldn\u2019t even lower prices if we wanted to and so, it\u2019s sort of is what it is and that\u2019s why Scott has mentioned, you know, you all follow this space, can see that.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alex Blostein","So, maybe go back to the M&A discussion for a second, so I guess this is the IDC deal, you know, ICE is really kind of focused on more bolt-on deals, to really sort of build on your core capabilities, whether it\u2019s trading, data, connectivity, et cetera, all deals is kind of on the smaller side. Your interest in eBay, albeit early, and you know implied potentially a wide range of things, but including maybe something larger. So, has anything changed and I guess, as we look forward should we anticipate a larger deals from ICE, in the future, including maybe in verticals that are not as obvious to us is what we have seen in the past?","Scott Hill","It\u2019s a good question and you and I have spoken publicly about some of our philosophy to some of your clients, but let me just reiterate it for others. We have a great platform and you just look at this first quarter and where we are going, it is phenomenal, the legacy businesses that we have built and the efficiencies that we have plugged into that platform are going to deliver growth and so, you know, I look at my job and the job of the managers that are my colleagues sitting around this table and as we think about whether not we can create additional growth and alpha for investors, we have really landed and in two places that seem to work for this company.","One is to buy smaller companies that are earlier in their life, where if we plug them into that platform that I just mentioned, we can accelerate their growth and we have done a number of things like that.","If you look at our mortgage business. I think it\u2019s probably the fastest growing part of ICE. These were smaller younger companies that we have put together and put on a very, very efficient new platform that we have tweaked and built, and they are growing double-digits and I think we will continue to do that.","I think this acquisition that we announced yesterday bridge to, I mean, you know, when we talk about thinking outside the box. I don\u2019t think any of our investors or peers have ever thought about whether or not you should be listening airline miles on an exchange, but these are the kinds of things that we are thinking about in terms of the second part of your question which is, are you looking at new verticals","Jeff Sprecher","The other thing that generates good returns for our investor base is if we buy older larger mature companies, where we can do something and this was like IDC, like NYSE, where we can do something with our platform and technology that would take an otherwise business that may be declining and reinvigorated, and I mean, to a certain degree, and we really believe that by the way to a certain degree, we had a bit of audacity when we bought Interactive Data. We said if we buy this company, we think we can double its growth rate and we did and you should ask us why would you say that, you didn\u2019t even have a sales force in ICE.","You didn\u2019t even have a billing platform that could send out an invoice for somebody that wanted to buy data and we were not in the fixed income space and that was a large fixed income platform and you know, what is the audacity of this management team at ICE to say you can buy this business and double it.","And the reality is because we really believe in the underpinnings of our platform and this network distribution that we have and we took that company and within a year, we had dramatically improved its top-line growth, while eliminating tremendous cost by getting on the sufficient infrastructure that we have built around here.","So, those two ends of the barbells, you know, larger companies, more complicated companies, that could use invigoration and smaller companies where we can improve their distribution tend to be how we best create values.","Typically, as you know, Alex, most people come to us to talk about companies in the middle, you know, fully valued and might be really attractive businesses and they are and their businesses we would love to own, but they are at a point where they are doing fine on themselves and there is nothing that we could do that would invigorate them to a degree that would overcome any premium that we might have to pay and we are just not people that want to subject our investor base to those kinds of acquisitions because they tend to be red, black, that\u2019s in the long run and, you know, on either end of the barbell are pretty well sure things for us and we are in the luxurious position, where we don\u2019t have to do anything, because our platform is so strong as designed, that we have the luxury of having these bi-monthly meetings that you and I have talked about in the past to think outside the box.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Kyle Voigt of KBW. Please go ahead.","Kyle Voigt","Maybe just a question on the Bakkt. As you mentioned, you are planning to launch consumer app later this year. I guess what are you looking at to evaluate the success of the consumer app and maybe back more broadly. Is it just adoption rates at first and then how should investors really think about the revenue model over the medium-term, from kind of that the consumer-facing part of that business? Thanks,","Jeff Sprecher","It\u2019s a good question and we set it up as a separate brand and we set it up as a company with separate investor pool. So that, we could have owned 100% of the company but we elected not to. Because it may have a different growth metric and valuation metric than our core business and that was intentional to give us flexibility at some point, we could pull it all in, at some point we could spend it all out, at some point we could bring in other partners and so we have a Capital Markets flexibility around the way we have organized, the name, the company, and set up the management and in fact we have them within our offices in a unique space that\u2019s key card controlled by them and so that it\u2019s truly allowed to operate within our ecosystem as a start-up.","And in that regard, you know, the next big hurdle for the company will be getting that app into consumer hands and we will be looking at consumer adoption, more than revenue or expense. Fortunately, the company is not a particularly big drain on us and with Bridge2, Scott will update you in the next quarter about how the company looks, but we have a lot of financial flexibility now with the company, given that it has a revenue stream both from trading and from operation of all these rewards programs for 4500 companies.","And so, I will be looking more towards consumer adoption. We also are engaged with, while we have talked about one consumer-oriented company on this call, we are engaged with a lot of consumer oriented companies and we have been very public about our engagement with Microsoft and how whether or not this platform can deal with digital game pieces and whether there is a market and a marketplace for digital gaming assets and that would fit nicely with other digital assets and so we are having a lot of conversations with larger consumer brands and merchants with some interesting ideas, now that we have got rewards and cryptocurrency and potentially gaming in one ecosystem and what else could plug into that and what are the synergies between various businesses.","Is it a case that an airline would like to have a different rewards, relationship with certain kinds of partners, with certain kinds of consumers, is there consumer data that can be shared across a collection of retailers that view a common customer base, that can use that rewards programs and incentives in different ways, can more millennials be attracted to those companies by virtue of having cryptocurrency or gaming assets in that ecosystem, so the conversations that we are having across a broad range of industries really lead me to say, not so much revenue in bottom line, but it\u2019s broad adoption I think for 2020 that will be looking towards.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Michael Carrier of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Michael Carrier","Maybe one more on more capital allocation and M&A and Jeff, you provide a lot of commentary on strategy and how you think about new transactions which is helpful? And I guess maybe more on the financial aspect, when you are looking at areas that are may be newer or not as straightforward to like the core business, how do you guys think about maybe the potential opportunities, but maybe the potential risks when you are looking at things that aren\u2019t as straightforward and then the timing of maybe like the financial returns versus like those end-market deals, if you can just put some context around it, you know whether it\u2019s you, Jeff or Scott?","Scott Hill","Yes, that\u2019s a great question and I really appreciate you asking that, because I think it\u2019s important. Jeff, I think very clearly stated that everything that has been discussed is very consistent with the same structure that we followed for 15 years, the biweekly meetings, the way we have thought strategically about the deal, the thoughts on how we use our platform, our management expertise to think about combinations.","The financial approach is exactly the same, it\u2019s very good. In the summer of 2017, we walked you through precisely how we think about the M&A that we expect deals to generate returns on investment above 10%, that we expect synergies to largely be realized in the first three years, that we look for deals that deliver accretion and that\u2019s intentionally, you know, kind of third-down the list, because it\u2019s really that return on investment and the importance of it being above our cost, the capital and above our hurdle rate, that\u2019s really important.","And that financial model, that financial discipline, it is how we approach every single deal, whether it\u2019s a bolt-on deal or a big deal, It\u2019s an obvious deal or a less obvious deal, the financial approach is exactly the same.","Clearly to the extent that it is deal, that\u2019s a little bit-off the beaten path, it\u2019s really important to be able to get in and due diligence, and yes, we expect we can get synergies, but where might those synergies be and so the important elements of the model with deals that are again a little more off the beaten path, really are we need to go into and validate where we think the cost can come out, where we think the platform synergies will exist, but again the approach to it is no different, the same financial discipline, the same financial model and frankly the same financial hurdles that we have told you guide our capital allocation are exactly the ones we apply to every single deal regardless of the nature of that deal.","Jeff Sprecher","And let me just give you, that was a quantitative answer, let me give you a qualitative point, that I hope doesn\u2019t get lost on our investor pool. This is a founder led company and I am surrounded by a management team that we have worked together for a very long time and we really know and I definitely know what this company is and isn\u2019t, like, you know, to a certain degree, I mean, we stitched it together, like I really know what we do well, but more importantly, I know what we don\u2019t do well.","I know areas that we are really poor at and there is no illusion that somehow, we are going to magically get better at something and by the way, unless we decide we want to get that expertise, but generally speaking, we know the lane that creates value for us and we have used that same model over and over and over again, and there is no reason to deviate from that model and so when we think about, is there a marketplace for airline miles or swords and sickles that are on a video game, you know, we are not crazy, we didn\u2019t lose our minds.","We know what our platform does and we know how to lever it and we feel really good about our ability to continue to find new asset classes and maybe more importantly for this investor group like mortgages, like fixed income create redeem, things that other management teams haven\u2019t touched, but the bolt-on well to our platform and so I just want to reassure everybody that the founders still here and the management team, that is I am a part of, is still together and we know we are, we know what we do and we didn\u2019t lose our minds over the weekend.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Dan Fannon","Thanks. And I guess just one more on M&A and I appreciate all the commentary thus far, but, I guess just the current context of what you guys are looking at today and how different that might be than say a year ago in terms of your outlook and outreach towards M&A in the number and size of deals and I guess just based on what you have said today and outlined in terms of your track record, I guess point like why wouldn\u2019t eBay engage with you, given the success you have had previously?","Scott Hill","Well, it\u2019s easy to ask the second part first, which is I don\u2019t know and I also mentioned that the first outreach to eBay was roughly 20 years ago. So, it\u2019s not one-touch, okay? so we think about things in the long run. By the way, when we bought the New York Stock Exchange, people were shocked and it came as a big surprise, my gosh, we have been talking to the New York Stock Exchange since we were a start-up.","So, you know, to a certain degree opportunity has to present itself, timing has to present itself, both management teams feel like it\u2019s the right move, at the right time and you have to respect other people, as a public company, CEO. I am totally respectful that different managements have different agendas, and they have different struggles, and different opportunity sets and we can\u2019t see them and we don\u2019t know what they are.","And so I would never be critical if somebody who wants to robust us because we were above people all the time, but we try to stay nice and close because you live long lives and you never know and here we are, you know, 20 years after I sat with Meg Whitman and the fact I asked Meg Whitman to be on my Board of Directors honestly and I ask for a lot of guidance from her and she is lovely and helpful and provided a real incentive and goal for us as a start-up.","And so anyway, I think you should assume that we have - that we are not unique with this one leak that there are dozens and dozens of companies that we have had long time touches with that we could talk to and share ideas with that have gone on and will continue to go on.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Ken Hill of Rosenblatt. Please go ahead.","Ken Hill","I wanted to come back to Bakkt for a minute. You guys have talked about a lot about M&A, but I was wondering if you are considering any partnerships in that space with some of the traditional payment plans because loyalty program seems like a hot area. And I asked because a lot of the payment terms, I cover when they roll out new products, they are doing it over 10s of millions, 100s of millions of customers so could a partnership in that area help jumpstart some customer adoption for Bakkt?","Jeff Sprecher","It\u2019s a very good question. If you look at the employee pool and the talent that we have recruited to Bakkt, there\u2019s a lot of people that have come from various payment companies and now people that have come from rewards companies once we close with Bridge2. And so we have a pretty good canvas in terms of having private dialogs with various companies and there is a lot of conversation going on.","At that level, a lot of conversation with traditional banking and Wall Street, who are thinking about - what is the Fintech will look like for banking when we go to a zero commission stock trading environment for retail consumers, what - how is been tech going to change the broad financial services landscape and here\u2019s back then, it has a digital wallet with a lot of connectivity right now and what else can be done with it.","So there is a tremendous number of conversations going on but importantly, we have built really an industrial scale platform there, that we have been working on now for well over a year with dozens and dozens and dozens of engineers that have built something that we know will scale because we are in a scale business that can hopefully look right out of the box as a company that doesn\u2019t look and feel like a traditional start-up in terms of its ability to deal with some traditional payments, people or banks or merchants, because I have talked to a lot of Fintech entrepreneurs and one of the things that a lot of people don\u2019t understand and rightly so and not to be critical, but financial services has a lot of rules and regulations around the world and we exist in that ecosystem and understand how we are going to be judged and monitored.","And successful businesses need to scale and then that\u2019s not easy to do and a lot of younger entrepreneurs building Fintech don\u2019t fully recognize that when you are handling other people\u2019s money, you really need a very powerful ecosystem with internal audits and checks and balances and surrounded by a cyber-security overlay.","So, and that\u2019s getting built-in, which gives us flexibility to talk to some of the kinds of companies that you are thinking of because I think it\u2019s going to be an attractive platform.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Brian Bedell","Maybe just continuing along that, Jeff these - your answers are really insightful here so really appreciate it. Just assuming given your conversation for eBay you are really talking about the marketplace component of eBay, but maybe more broadly what is it that you are - that the ICE platform and why is that uniquely positioned to leverage the consumer marketplace and then, maybe just talk about what are your ambitions longer term to move more into the consumer space versus the B2B space that ICE has always been - especially on financial customers?","And then just a quick one for Scott, how much do you think you could raise the debt-to-EBITDA capacity if you are bringing on a more recurring revenue business versus just the ICE legacy business right now?","Jeff Sprecher","So let me just say, again I don\u2019t want to comment on eBay and how they run their company or how we would help them run their company. Those are conversations that at some point, we would love to have with eBay management if they are open to it, but I don\u2019t really want to do that in public.","But let me just say that, I will tell you that a large platform that we have, which is largely a database management platform doesn\u2019t really know whether or not the top high-frequency trading firm, that\u2019s using a liquid cooled computer and blasting bits and bytes off the [indiscernible] in order to interface with us. That\u2019s bit and byte is no different than our retiree sitting in their kitchen clicking on a mouse.","Our ability to handle massive amounts of data securely, efficiently, put it in a database, sort it, search it, manipulate it, cleanse it and give it back out to people is a core talent that we have here, that is what ICE is. Just as an aside, I started the company by buying a little failing firm from MidAmerican Energy, which is Warren Buffett\u2019s electric utility and by the way I bought it right before he acquired MidAmerican. So he is a smarter investor than most of us on the call.","But I bought this company it was called the Continental Power Exchange. I changed the name, I decided to call it Intercontinental because I thought being Continental was too limiting and I took the word Power out of it, because I thought just focusing on Power was too limiting. And so we end up with the name Intercontinental Exchange. I swear if I were starting this company today, I would probably call it the Intercontinental Massively Scalable Network and Database Company","because that\u2019s what we are. That\u2019s what airline miles and gaming sorts and credit default swaps and delivering barges that we manage in Rotterdam for fuel oil, that\u2019s what happens, those endpoints are ubiquitous to that network in my mind.","Scott Hill","And just to pick up on that for the more boring part of the question about financial capacity, not bits and bytes, or swords and sickles. I think the key thing I would tell you is our capacity for any deal really rest on I think three key factors.","Number one, our commitment to do that by our investors, so the deal has the right return and to be able to present a good deal to the ratings agencies in the bondholders to borrow. And so we have to be able to do that. If we can tell the right story and demonstrate how it meets the needs of all of our important constituents that will generate capacity for us.","The second thing is that the deal that we are talking about has to generate the cash to allow us to delever and to do so in a meaningfully fast way and we have done that historically, all of the times that we have decided to lever up, we have committed to lever back down within three years and in most cases, it\u2019s taken 18 months and not much more. And so that\u2019s the second thing, do you have a plan to delever, and by the way, do you have a track record of being able to delever.","And so the relationships with our investors with bondholders are important, the ability and the track record of deleveraging important but then the third thing we spend an hour not talking about a volume business that\u2019s crushing at right now. We had some good questions earlier about a data business that is growing at twice the level of the large company we acquired a few years ago at over 50% margins. The combination of that business generates $3.3 billion of EBITDA.","It generated last year, $2.3 billion of free cash flow. That\u2019s where capacity comes from. That\u2019s the starting point, it\u2019s the strength of the existing business, the fact that all of our colleagues aren\u2019t listening to this call, but they are running our exchanges, and are clearing houses, and selling data, and building ETF Hub and building a mortgage business, that\u2019s the foundation of capacity because if we don\u2019t have that $3 billion of EBITDA, if that EBITDA hadn\u2019t grown every single year for 14 years, we wouldn\u2019t be able to enter into a conversation about going and levering up.","So it\u2019s those three things that drive it with the last one being the fundamentally most important one.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Sprecher for any closing remarks.","Jeff Sprecher","Thank you, Rocco. Well, this was an interesting call and this management team will go away and think big thoughts and we will be back to share those with you next quarter, but meanwhile, as Scott said, please take a look at our volume and open interest and refine your models and see what\u2019s going on here, because we are very, very proud of where we are year-to-date. And we look forward to talking next quarter.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Today\u2019s conference has now concluded and we thank you all for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day."],"11850":["Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Kelly Loeffler, Senior Vice President, Corporate Communications, Marketing, and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Kelly Lynn Loeffler - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Good morning. ICE's first quarter 2017 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investor section of theice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2016 Form 10-K.","In our earnings supplements, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures including adjusted income, adjusted operating margin, expenses, EPS, EBITDA, and tax rate. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP term in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful as well as how management uses these measures.","When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. With us on the call are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Chuck Vice, President and Chief Operating Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Thanks, Kelly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report on our first quarter results which included solid volume and data revenue growth, continued expense discipline and increased capital returns. I'll start this morning on slide four, which lists some highlights from the quarter. Data revenues grew 6% organically versus the prior year on a constant currency basis and increased sequentially from a strong fourth quarter. This reflects the strategic rationale of building out our data operations to capture our customers' increasing demand for information.","In our trading and clearing segment, average daily volume or ADV grew 4% and open interest grew 6%. Growth accelerated further in April and on a year-to-date basis both ADV and open interest are now 9% versus a year ago. Though currency and mix are impacting revenue, these volume and OI trends reflect continued demand for the risk management services our global trading and clearing businesses provide.","Next, I want to highlight that the NYSE continues to attract world class companies in a very robust IPO environment. Through April, over 85% all capital raised by the IPOs of U.S. operating companies happened on the NYSE, including five IPOs this past Friday. All of this helped us generate cash flows of $611 million which allowed us to return nearly $350 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, the second largest quarterly capital return in our company's history.","During the quarter, we also continued to refine our portfolio which will sharpen our strategic focus and generate additional cash to support future investments, capital returns and deleveraging. Finally, I want to note that we look forward to seeing many of you at our Investor Day on June 2 where you will have an opportunity to hear from our extended management team. These individuals have deep expertise in their respective fields and their fingers on the pulse of the business lines they oversee. They will provide an in-depth look at how we are positioned to continue to grow and deliver strong returns for our shareholders.","Now let's move to slide five where I'll recap our first quarter consolidated financial results. First quarter revenues of $1.16 billion were up 1% year-to-year and up 3% on a constant currency basis. We will refer to revenue growth on a constant currency basis given the significant impact from the decline in both the pound and the euro on a year-to-year basis.","Adjusted operating expenses in the first quarter were $495 million. We remain on track towards our full year expense guidance and expect adjusted expenses in the second quarter between $485 million and $495 million. This includes a net reduction of around $10 million in expenses associated with the IDMS sale and the acquisition of TMX Atrium. Adjusted operating margins in the first quarter were 57%. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.74.","Next on slide six, I'll discuss our data and listings segment. These largely recurring revenues comprise 54% of our consolidated revenues in the first quarter. Segment revenues grew 9% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and we expanded operating margin to 52% by delivering on our synergy commitment even as we invest in strategic growth opportunities.","Listings revenue grew 2% in the first quarter. More importantly, though, as previously noted, we've had great success in a very robust IPO market through the first four months of this year. And, as you know, these current year wins drive listings revenue growth primarily in the subsequent year and generate revenue across trading and data as well.","Speaking of our data business, we had another strong quarter. On an organic constant currency basis, data revenue grew 6% over the prior first quarter. For clarity, we define organic revenue growth to exclude the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures that significantly impact the current period year-over-year comparison.","For the first quarter, organic growth excludes the first quarter 2017 revenues from the Securities Evaluations business and CMA. The table on the lower left portion of this slide shows the constant currency growth rates to which I'll refer for each individual business in the right-hand column.","Pricing and analytics revenues in constant currency increased 18% year-to-year in the first quarter. On an organic constant currency basis, revenues grew 6%, accelerating from 4% growth in the fourth quarter. We continue to benefit from high customer retention rates, new products, and increased value capture, coupled with a fully integrated sales team cross-selling to existing clients and adding new customers.","Next, our exchange data revenues grew 7% over the prior first quarter. We continue to see solid demand for our exchange data product and expect full year growth of between 4% and 5% on top of last year's 14% growth.","Finally, revenue in our desktop and connectivity category grew 3% year-to-year, reflecting demand for more capacity to consume our pricing and analytics and exchange data products. I'll pause here to note that with the completion of the sale of IDMS and the acquisition of the TMX Atrium business, we expect desktop and connectivity revenues to be around $12 million lower in each subsequent quarter this year.","As you can see, we continue to curate our data business to grow faster than the industry by targeting the areas of greatest customer demand. And, importantly, our annual subscription value, or ASV, entering 2Q is up 6% versus the prior year. Our organic growth and the synergies we are realizing from our acquisition integration will help us continue to deliver expanding and industry-leading operating margins.","Please turn to slide seven where I'll review our trading and clearing segment. Revenues were down 4% year-to-year on a constant currency basis. However, in our futures markets, first quarter ADV was up 4% versus a strong first quarter in the prior year. Open interest was up 6% versus the prior first quarter and we set open interest future records in Brent, gas oil, heating oil, UK natural gas, cocoa, and MSCI indices during the quarter.","Finally, though equity market trends remain challenging, we have a number of initiatives underway at NYSE to enhance our leadership position, including the strategy we announced in January to diversify our market model and to list more securities on our floor-based markets.","Before leaving slide seven, I want to highlight that the second quarter is off to an auspicious start. April ADV rose 26% versus last April. Commodity ADV increased 7% in April, with oil up 12%. Financials ADV grew over 60% year-to-year driven by interest rates. And, importantly, open interest is now up 9% from a year ago, supporting our confidence in the continued demand for our product set and risk management tools.","I'll wrap up my remarks on slide eight. We generated over $600 million in operating cash flow during the first quarter. We use these strong cash flows to invest in our business and to return approximately $350 million to shareholders, including $229 million through share repurchases and $120 million through dividends. And, importantly, we recently completed the sale of our Cetip stake and those proceeds will enable us to meet our leverage target while continuing our share repurchases, including nearly $80 million already repurchased this quarter.","So, less than 18 months after closing the IDC acquisition we're generating strong data revenue growth, we've accelerated and increased our expense synergies, we've strategically enhanced our business, we've delevered and we've returned nearly $900 million through dividends and share repurchases. And, as we look ahead, we're on track to meet our 2017 objectives for growth, synergies, and integration milestones and capital returns.","I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A, but for now I'll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Thank you, Scott. As you can see, the balance across our transaction and non-transactions segments is complementary, where trading drives data and listings drives trading. This comprehensive model has enabled us to provide a compelling value proposition for customers while steadily growing our cash flow and increasing our capital return.","You can see that balance on slide nine with the valuable range of services we provide to support our customers' trading, investing, and risk management activities. We've strategically positioned ICE as the most global exchange operator with half of our profits derived outside the U.S. To achieve this reach, we've built a globally connected network of solutions for our customers, many of whom also operate on a global scale and who rely upon us each day for mission-critical services.","Through this network, we deliver a vast range of content that serves our customers across their workflow. We offer a diverse range of products through common technology across our worldwide exchanges and clearinghouses which enables us to scale our offerings into the provision of data services. Because trading, investing and risk management all require an increasing amount of information, we're extremely well positioned to directly serve these growing customer needs. In addition, the predictability of our revenue model is increasing given the growth of our subscription based businesses, which improves our ability to consistently return capital while we invest in growth.","Moving to slide 10, we're focused on becoming a global leader in the provision of data services. We've demonstrated our ability to exceed the industry's growth rate by focusing on areas of opportunity as demonstrated by our year-over-year track record of growing data revenues on both an annual and a quarterly basis since 2010.","How have we done this? In part, our success is driven by a clear commitment to investing prudently to put the company in a position to benefit from the secular trends for increased data consumption that we've shown you over the last several quarters. In addition, we benefit from the growth of our exchange business coupled with new products, the addition of new customers, selling more to our existing customers and rationalizing our pricing across our wide range of solutions. This helps to ensure that we're highly competitive and contributing to earnings growth.","Our experience in operating exchanges gave us firsthand knowledge that data is an increasingly valuable part of the service that exchanges provide. In addition, with our roots in the over the counter markets and in clearing, we saw that analytics, indices and valuation services were becoming increasingly important products. We made some of our first investments in indices and valuation capabilities well over a decade ago, and we've continued to build on these. So, when we saw the opportunity to acquire Interactive Data, it was a rare opportunity to gain a foothold into an established set of proprietary data products and gain a dedicated sales force.","We believe that the market for data will continue to grow due to automation, regulation and increased risk management. Each of these requires more data to inform these activities. We're seeing a customer shift towards taking data via direct feeds and powering targeted applications with more flexible pricing packages as customers move away from traditional multi-asset class desktops.","That fits our approach to providing data solution given our vast array of proprietary data that we can bundle and sell directly. I think that we're lining up very well to meet the demand and I'm pleased with our rapid progress in becoming a more effective and capable supplier.","Turning to slide 11, you can see that our global presence drives results for each part of our business. Last Friday we extended our very clear lead in capital raising with five IPOs taking place on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on that single day. Our global leadership with the NYSE listings franchise is part of a concerted effort that we've made over the last three years since acquiring the business.","Our team is focusing on providing the best service, value, and market access. As a result, NYSE has listed the vast majority of significant companies going public this year, including large tech IPOs. And that track record extends back to nearly every major IPO over the last couple of years, including the IPOs for Snap, Yext and Canada Goose, for example, during the first quarter.","We recently rolled out our new NYSE Connect platform based on ICE's data and technology that we adopted from our other businesses. We're able to offer this platform to our listed companies at no charge in contrast to other exchanges where corporate solutions is a revenue line. NYSE is known for its proven market model, value and services, meaning we offer a true partnership to listed companies. For exchanged traded fund issuers, NYSE lists ETFs covering more than 90% of the U.S. assets under management. And to attract more trading, we plan to expand the number of stocks traded on the NYSE floor to include all U.S. securities, further leveraging the benefits of our unique model.","Why does this matter? It enables us to better serve our customers by providing the deepest liquidity pools with designated market makers that ultimately lower volatility. And when companies choose to list on the NYSE, this generates trading and data revenues as well. This is the virtuous cycle that demonstrates the synergistic nature of our model.","Moving on to slide 12 and the transaction and clearing segment, you can see the results that our global markets continue to deliver. Futures volume and open interest grew solidly in the first quarter on top of a strong first quarter last year, despite there being less market volatility this year. Year-to-date our average daily volume is up 9%. Our markets our prudently diversified across products ranging from oil, natural gas, agriculture, equity indices, and interest rates.","The breadth and depth of our markets enable us to attract liquidity and related products. As an example, we're growing the MCSI and FTSE index futures alongside European interest rate and foreign exchange futures. These are globally relevant products that allow us to attract more customers for trading and data consumption. Equally important, the trends in open interest are also directionally favorable in our key asset classes alongside of our volume growth.","I'll move on to slide 13 for more detail on the global nature of our markets. You can see that when looking at volume during European and Asian market hours, we have a strong presence internationally. And we continue to build on that with products like Dubai Crude, Singapore Jet Fuel, Rotterdam Gas Oil, European Emissions, and Japan Naphtha, along with our benchmark European interest rate and equity index futures. On the slide, you can see the results of our comprehensive offering for the global oil markets which generated record revenues during the first quarter on record volume and record open interest.","The range of energy products we offer continues to grow, not dissimilar to Amazon's model of a long-tail business where the breadth of our market contributes to the overall depth of our market. We have an unsurpassed energy commodity offering ranging from futures and OTC markets, the Platt's eWindow, the electric power and natural gas basis markets and the nearly 1,000 new products that we've developed for clearing to create a complete product suite. More broadly ICE's leadership in oil futures continues with over 50% of total open interest across Brent and WTI futures.","And finally we continue to grow and have upside in supporting the market's desire for price discovery in electronically traded commodity options as evidenced by the 100% volume increase over last year's first quarter for screen-traded energy options on ICE.","And despite the relatively low price volatility, we're growing our natural gas business globally given the increasing demand for cleaner fuels coupled to the abundance of supply. Importantly, our continued growth in the broad energy market is a key contributor for both our trading and data segments.","Moving to slide 14, I'll touch on the momentum in our European interest rate business over the last year where volume and open interest continue to grow due to the activity of global central banks. While ICE's reported revenues have been impacted by the currency depreciation of Europe, the volume expansion of this business amid entrants like Nasdaq's defunct NLX and CurveGlobal demonstrates the value of our offering and our platform for future growth. While there's no explicit timetable for European Central Bank interest rate increases, our increasing trading volumes are positive indications of the market's prediction of an improving economy.","On a related note, I was honored to be a panelist at the Prosperity UK Conference last week in London. The agenda was to look ahead to the UK's future in a post-Brexit world. Similar to the U.S. with our change in administration, the UK has an opportunity to also move towards a pro-growth platform and avoid the burdens of duplicative regulation. I believe that the UK has every ability to adopt policies to retain the business that it has earned and that the UK and the EU will find ways to work together constructively. I further believe that the evolving landscape in the EU will also offer ICE new business opportunities.","We've been fairly transparent, however, in our beliefs that Europe's MiFID II is a poorly designed piece of legislation for the current environment and for providing the capital markets with certainty. I remain hopeful that as the billions of pounds and euros of compliance costs are considered relative to their benefit, we'll see new market-oriented solutions prevail. Regulation is needed but asymmetrical regulation can create unintended consequences, and this is one of the issues that policymakers at the IMF and the World Bank discussed last month at their meetings in Washington, D.C.","That being said, ICE is preparing to serve our customers under all eventualities, as we always do, and we have a number of work streams ongoing to maximize the new revenue opportunities that this legislation creates. One such example is our recent agreement with Euronext to license our commercially open access clearing services at ICE Clear Netherlands. This is yet again an illustration of the value of having our global footprint in a fragmenting world. So we continue positioning our exchange, clearing, and data operations at the leading edge to help our customers and to provide solutions to them that are responsive to the ongoing changes in the global landscape.","I'll close on slide 15 and I'll note that our focus has turned towards the balance of the year to build on our track record of growth. We're strategically executing across the broad opportunity set that we've covered on the slide here. I'd like to recognize and thank our customers for their confidence in the quarter and I want to thank my colleagues at ICE for delivering these great results.","I'll now turn the call back to our moderator, Kate, to conduct the question-and-answer session until 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will take our first question from Richard Repetto of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Scott.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Morning.","Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Good morning.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","The first question is on the very popular topic of market data. And I'm just trying to see, Scott, whether the GAAP guidance of 5% growth is still affirmed in market data and it appears that you expect a ramp if currency stayed flat going out to replace the IDMS lost revenue. Is that correct, on a GAAP basis?","Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","I'm not 100% sure I understood the second part of your question, Rich, but on one of the slides Jeff addressed, we did reiterate that we believe our data business will grow at least 6% for the year. I think that's further supported by the ASV metric, which is up 6%. IDMS and TMX Atrium, the net of those businesses I mentioned would reduce revenues about $12 million a quarter over second quarter, third quarter, and fourth quarter.","That notwithstanding, I think what you'll see adjusted for that is we accelerated from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, adjusted for that reduction in that acquired and divested business. We'll see an acceleration into the second quarter, or we would have seen an acceleration. And I would expect we'll see an acceleration into the third and fourth quarter as well. So we're happy with the way the data business is trending and we're happy with the fact that what we're seeing is really solid growth on top of growth in the prior year. So, again, I didn't quite follow the second half of your question. If I didn't answer it, maybe try again.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. I think that answered it, or I'm sure other people will ask about market data as well. I'll limit myself to one follow-up, though. I guess I've got to ask this, Jeff, I've gotten a handful of emails about this. But there was an article from Bloomberg that came out talking about M&A. I know you don't discuss anything specifically, but I guess the broad question is wouldn't you think that it'd be \u2013 in any combination of two major futures exchanges, wouldn't there be antitrust or issues? It's certainly got everybody talking I guess this morning, if you can make any comments.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Well, I can't. And you graciously prefaced that in the question, so I appreciate that, Rich. You know, let me just say that I think that our company is unique in that we're always looking for ways to grow value for shareholders and we not only buy companies but we buy companies that we think we can grow organically. And we just proved that by the first question that you asked Scott. And we also dispose of companies where we think we're not good operators or where somebody else could do better with the firm than we could.","So we're constantly looking at the way we go to market and try to be innovative. We look at deals that other people don't think about. And we're always amused when the market thinks we're going one direction and internally we know that the market is wrong; we're going another direction. So that's just part of the way we think around here, because I'm surrounded by a lot of entrepreneurs, and we're constantly generating new ideas on what to do to best serve customers given the macro trends in our space. So I'll leave it at that, if you don't mind, and let you guys go talking.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. I'll leave it at that as well, and I'll stay to the one follow-up. Thanks.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thanks, guys. Scott, maybe on the transaction side, particularly on that futures business, when we look at the trends, both open interest and ADV, and not just for April but year-to-date, things are looking pretty strong, obviously some tough comps last year. And just wanted to get a sense, obviously, there's some that's environmental, maybe on rate, the rate backdrop in Europe. But it also seems like on the desktop, like your revenue growth is picking up. So just wanted to get some sense on like maybe user growth versus the environment. Because it does seem like there's more going on than just a better environment for some of the products. So any color behind that would be helpful.","Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Okay. Let me \u2013 there's somewhat two questions imbedded in there. Let me touch on kind of the futures business. We are seeing very strong growth. Through yesterday, overall volumes in the quarter are up 24%. In terms of revenue, as you mentioned, it's not only a tough compare, it's also a tough currency environment. And in interest rates in particular with the volatility, the customer mix has impacted rates.","But as I step back and look at it, there's no question that we continue to see strong commercial demand around our platform. And that's what's really driving the volumes and, more importantly what's driving the open interest. Open interest up 9% year over year. There's not a better leading indicator for the robustness of the business as we look forward. Again, currency and mix and all the other factors aside, which you can't really control, open interest says that the commercial customers are still really interested in the market. And I'll give you a subset example of that. When I step back and look at the best indicator for our oil markets, to me that's open interest. And our open interest for oil went above 50% share about two years ago, and it stayed there.","And again, I think that's an indicator that there's continued interest. Whether oil's moving up above 50 or down towards 50, the commercial customers are in there hedging their risk. So we've definitely seen continued strong growth and customer interest in our markets. And I think that's, as you mentioned, translating over into strength we're seeing in our desktop and connectivity business.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","I'll mention \u2013 the second part of your question, I mentioned in my prepared remarks but I'll elaborate a little bit. The reason that we're focused on the data part of our business is that historically exchanges like ours took data to market by basically wholesaling the data to third-party data vendors, and largely that data went into these large multi-asset class desktops that people were acquiring.","Today we're seeing a different trend, which is our customers want more customized applications on their desktop, probably no different than you and I on our smartphone. And we see them taking, for example, MarketAxess screens for their bond business, FactSet screens for their equity business, Aladdin screens for risk management, and ICE screens for commodities.","And so the nature of the desktop is changing to more tailored, bespoke, customized, targeted solutions. And the data that's underlying that, many people want it on a pipe. In other words, they want just to buy the direct feed from us so that they can customize and power the way that individual people in their operations are accessing data, using new algorithms, new risk management tools and alike that people are using to get an edge for trading and risk management, and also to be responsive to compliance.","Just one other comment I'll make to elaborate on what Scott said about our interest rate business. What's been very amazing for us to watch is that our European interest rate business has been more responsive it seems to U.S. Fed actions than the U.S. interest rate complex. So in other words, the market is watching what the U.S. central bank does and is then imposing what the results of that are on Europe and abroad and reacting to that, and we see risk management being done in our market.","So it's been an interesting suite of products to own where it's not necessarily directly correlated to what the ECB and the Bank of England do.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just quick follow-up. Scott, just on the capital management, an active quarter when we look at buybacks data (32:00) and the dividend. Just any sense on what you think going forward in terms of priorities, whether it's given where the stock is, given the M&A environment out there, just any color?","Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","I don't think it's really changed from our comments previously. As you probably noticed, we actually ended up spending more in the first quarter than we had originally indicated. We had said $200 million, we spent $230 million, and that did have to do with, as you say, our view on the stock price. You may recall that early in the quarter it was languishing around $57, $58 and we aggressively accelerated. I mentioned that through yesterday we're already at $80 million. We don't really project going forward in terms of what it's likely to be, but if you look at the first quarter and you look at the first third of this quarter, I think that gives you an indication of where we're headed.","And I think the good thing is, I mentioned on 16 months past the close of the deal, with the Cetip deal closed, we're effectively at our leverage target. We've returned $900 million. We've shown a preference to share repurchases and that's historically been the case and I would expect it will be the case going forward. But don't miss the fact that the dividend is up 17% year-over-year in the first quarter and that's the, I think, third or fourth consecutive double digit increase since we instituted it.","So really no change in terms of capital allocation as I said on the last earnings call. We think we can do strategic bolt-on M&A just as we're doing and continue to be really aggressive on repurchases and effectively return 100% of our free cash flows over the course of this year.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","The next question is from Alex Kramm of UBS. Please go ahead.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, everyone. Just wanted to hone in on the market data again, particularly on the exchange data. When you look back 12 months in the second quarter of last year you got a pretty big bump that surprised lot of people. And I think one of the things that happened back then was that on the ICE futures side, some fee waivers expired. If I understand it correctly, there's a second component of that that happened this April. So could you just talk a little bit how what you expect here in the second quarter, how big that bump should be as well on a quarter over quarter basis. And then maybe just in general around exchange data, obviously, some of your competitors showed some weakness, so maybe you can compare and contrast your business there a little bit.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yeah, Alex. So, what you're referring to is that we used to have a group of people that got free data from us and we decided to convert everybody to paying customers. And so our customer base, if you will, for the purchase of data dramatically expanded as many of those people that used to get it through various sources for free turned around and signed subscription agreements with us.","That is still in the marketplace. It's a broader audience, it gives us more people to sell to and so on and so forth. We haven't touched that program since instituting it a year ago but, as Scott has guided you, we do think that our overall data revenues are going to continue to grow along the way that we've been growing in the first quarter.","Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yes, and I think specifically to the last part of your question, our exchange data business was up sequentially from the fourth quarter and we expect it will be it sequentially in the second quarter versus the first quarter. And, as Jeff alluded to, we continue to see more customers looking for different ways to consume more of our data. So we remain very confident in that business. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, 4% to 5% growth for the year on top of 14% growth last year.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And then just secondly something small here but, Scott, you had that one-time item in the first quarter here, the accrual for legal things, I believe. I don't know if you touched upon that in your prepared remarks but can you just flesh it out? And importantly, you said it was an ongoing item and it was $10 million this quarter, so just wondering is it something that actually happened in the cost base? Not trying to be too cute here but obviously it's $10 million. It gets you from the high end of your guidance range to the low end in the quarter so I feel like it's obviously important.","Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yes. That's an accrual that's an estimate of potential exposure related to certain ongoing legal and regulatory matters. And I can't really say a lot more than that other than pointing out that by the nature of non-GAAP in it, it's our view that that's not a typical charge. And so I don't think it would be appropriate to look at as it's a difference between the high or the low end of our expense range. It's not something you'd put in the run rate moving forward. It's just, you know, as per accounting, when you come to a conclusion that you have an estimate of a potential exposure, you book it, and that's what we did.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","But it wasn't \u2013 you hadn't had anything related to that previously? So this was completely new, I guess the point.","Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yes. Yes, again, which goes to the reason why we non-GAAPed it.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Kyle Voigt of KBW. Please go ahead.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. I guess one on Europe and Brexit, and I know you made some comments around this in your prepared remarks, but it really seems like the tension continues to build around euro-denominated clearing and whether there's going to be a location requirement here post-Brexit. Am I interpreting your comments correctly that you think there will be an agreement reached there to keep this in the UK longer term? If you could just elaborate on that. And then maybe, secondly, as we think about the impacts to your business, can you just address some of the risks maybe around your IBOR and then some of the opportunities you talked about maybe in the EU post-Brexit.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Sure. Yeah, I mean I tend to think that markets are rational and so the UK and the EU will end up someplace that works for both parties. And we sit in the UK but the E.U. has an argument that I think has validity, which is that during times of stress, if there's stress on the euro derivatives market and the European Central Bank has to step in and provide liquidity, then it needs some visibility into the market.","And so I see the debate that's going on right now is about the role of the ECB and the visibility that it has in these markets. And that, starting at that premise, that is a not irrational view for Europe. The question is how does that manifest itself? Is it an actual physical moving of products? Is it a joint oversight? Is it a college of regulators? There are a number of solutions that I suspect will be teased out during the Brexit negotiations.","And I've long said that we have viewed the markets as becoming more fragmented due to the fact that regulators are implementing their version of oversight in different ways with different timetables. And we all went through a global conversion from analog to digital, where we could sit in our living rooms and access the rest of the world, and we're somewhat unimpeded in doing that, and that happened \u2013 so the birth of the Internet age.","What's happening now is regulation is catching up and wants to have oversight locally. And so it's starting to fragment what we used to enjoy as a holistic market. And we've set the company up specifically for that. So our Netherlands operation, which is located in the EU, has now been converted over to have all ICE technology. We have a management team that we've put in place there. And if we needed to move certain contracts to the continent, it would be relatively easy for us to do that. In other words, it's database work for us. I'm not minimizing what that would mean for customers, because they will also have to change account structures and domiciles of how they manage those accounts and funds flow. But generally this is not about picking up and find new office buildings and relocating people. It's about moving files and legal structures. And so we're very, very prepared for that.","I think that \u2013 my own view is that the UK has largely over hundreds of years been a global free market trade destination for people to do commerce, and that the EU has got a different agenda right now, which is integrating multiple countries, multiple cultures that have a common financial market. And that the divorce, while it's unfortunate, would allow each of those groups to focus on the thing that they want to focus on right now, and I think both will create opportunities for us.","And we're thrilled that we are able to work with Euronext, for example, and move their derivatives clearing into our Netherlands clearinghouse. It is an example of the so-called open access where multiple exchanges share a common clearinghouse. We have a great relationship with them, given that we used to own them. We totally understand the business that they're bringing to us, we totally understand the technology. It's going to be a move that I think will be beneficial for both of us and probably would not have happened had there not been a Brexit.","So I'm a glass half full kind of attitude and surrounded by entrepreneurs. And we see a lot of opportunity for the growth of our company, even though this is a pretty stressful time on a lot of companies in Europe.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the thoughts.","Operator","The next question is from Vincent Hung of Autonomous. Please go ahead.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Hi. So data ASV growth was 6% this quarter, looks to have declined versus the 8% in 4Q. Are there some moving parts impact in that? And can you also clarify the definition, if this is just referring to pricing and analytics?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yes. So, Vincent, the changed ASV is fairly simple. The ASV measures where we are entering the period this year versus the period last year. Entering the first quarter, the pricing policy changes that we implemented in 2016 were fully baked in. Entering 2016 back in the first quarter, they weren't, because as you know those were implemented in the second quarter. And so there's a bit of an apples and oranges that drove the 8%; that normalizes its way out entering the second quarter. Pricing policy changes were in the base last year, they're in the current year, and so year over year the ASV lines up more closely as you would expect with our expectation on revenue growth for the year.","And with regards to your second question, I think what you may be asking is to refresh on what I said with regard to how we're thinking about the organic measure for pricing and analytics. And on that one, and frankly in the second quarter and the third and fourth quarter, we'll likely do a similar thing on desktops and connectivity. What we wanted to do is just give you a view of pricing and analytics, and again in future quarters desktops and connectivity adjusted for the material impact of the Securities Evaluations business, which we didn't own until the fourth quarter last year, and then IDMS business net of TMX Atrium, which really will reduce revenue 2Q through 4Q. So it's our effort to try and give you for each of those line items better visibility into the underlying business growth.","I'll note that it's challenging, because the reality is the Securities Evaluations business in the first quarter was better than we expected and better than it was in the fourth quarter. And I would argue that that's largely because of our team and our ownership. That notwithstanding, I'm not trying to parse out which part of it was organic or not. But generally speaking, as we roll forward we'll try and give you that kind of visibility where any particular acquisition or divestiture impacts one of those line items in a material manner.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks very much. Good morning. Maybe, Scott, if I could just zero in a little bit on the run rate in the second quarter, given we have some moving parts. So obviously we have the $12 million drop from the divestiture of IDMS net of the acquisition of Atrium. If we look at just sort of the organic growth rates that you're outlining for the year and assume that's a good run rate into the second quarter, I would get sort of a data number around $512 million, $513 million. Just want to make sure I'm doing that correctly and if that's a good run rate to base off of coming into the back of the year. And then if you can comment on Trayport and how that would \u2013 if you had to divest that, how much that would reduce the revenue by on a quarterly basis.","Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yes. So first of all, I think \u2013 without validating your particular number, I think the logic you followed to get to it is spot on. So I think you're thinking about it exactly right. And with regards to Trayport, when we bought that business we noted that it was about $80 million of revenue at about a 50% margin. And I can't really say anything more to you about it right now. Obviously, we remain in the process. And if we get to a point where that trajectory changes, we'll come back and update guidance at that point.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So that second quarter run rate then is clean now with deals at this level? In other words from a run rate perspective, that's what we should be forecasting going from that basis.","Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yes. As we sit here today, yes.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Then just going back to Europe, Jeff, your comments on Brexit. If you had to bifurcate that volume on rates in the UK versus your Netherlands clearinghouse, would that be something more along the lines of separating just the Euribor versus the sterling, so keeping the sterling in the UK, Euribor over to Europe? Or would that be also really cutting up that Euribor and bifurcating that between European customers and UK customers, if you were forced to do that? Would you see that as something that would be impactful or not really that big a deal?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","That's a good question. I have had the great privilege of talking to senior managers at a lot of the banks that are coming up with contingency plans for various outcomes of the BREXIT negotiations. One of the interesting themes is that once things start to move, if they were to move, there aren't obvious lines of demarcation where things would stop. In other words, put yourself in the position of a bank manager. You have sales people probably already and you need then maybe risk management people and compliance people. And the next thing you know, you're moving more and more and more in order to support the organization. So as we talk to our customer base about how they're thinking of moving, we haven't come to an obvious answer, an obvious break point.","And people are \u2013 all of us in financial services are thinking of the two ends of the barbell. What are the extremes if we don't go? And what are the extremes if we do go? And then what are the shades of gray in between? And it is not obvious. For us, however, you should understand that part of the logic of building this company has been to get everybody on a common technology so that our connections, for example, to market makers and banks, the way people are located to us, the way our data feeds operate, are really agnostic to where the geographic domicile for regulation is.","And so a move is really, like I mentioned, more of a back office operation. Certainly has lots of implications and impact on our customers. But from ICE's standpoint, we've built the company to do that. And you've seen us move contracts and jurisdictions around already, move from one clearinghouse to another and move across various platforms. And that's the kind of business that we think a lot about and develop internal processes for. So we sit in a relatively luxurious position, waiting for the outcome of what our customers actually want to do.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So if those liquidity pools were cut up a little bit, you don't think that would have a material impact on the pricing ability on both the clearing and the trading side?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Might have just the opposite, in fact. We've seen \u2013 think about the new entrants that have come into some of our markets where they create a new pool of trading. Let's take energy for example, there's some new entrants, new pools of trading. What does it result for us? Record volume, record open interest, record revenue. Look at European interest rates, new competitor there, record volume for us.","When you split these liquidity pools, and entrants may do that and regulators may cause that, what happens is that overall volumes tend to go up because the market starts to arbitrage and tries to put the market back together, the value of data goes up. And the whole thing for us turns out to be very good business. We fight that because we don't think it's in the best interest of the market. We have ways of growing otherwise, but we have positioned ourselves for more fragmentation which ultimately I think leads to higher revenues and earnings for ICE.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's great color. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs, please go ahead.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Just a clarification question, I guess at this point. So, Scott, I think you mentioned that your expense guidance for the year remains as you guys highlighted on the last call, I think it was $1.94 billion, $1.98 billion. Is that inclusive of the Atrium cost that, I guess, coming in this quarter. And then maybe you could just give us an update on run rate savings from IDC integration you guys expect to be at by the end of the year and how much is left for 2018?","Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yes, so you're right the full-year guidance didn't change. We said it was $1.94 billion to $1.96 billion, (51:54) effectively flat versus the prior year. But last quarter I did mention that those expenses, it would be flat plus maybe $10 million to $12 million net of all the various acquisitions and divestitures that we have talked about to date. So again, still inside that range with maybe the acquisitions pushing it up a little above the middle overall. That's the reason why we didn't reiterate it, because we're still in the same guidance range.","In terms of synergies, you may recall that we entered the year by increasing our synergies to $130 million to go. We said we'd get $60 million out this year, we're on track to do that. We said we'd get the remaining $70 million over 2018 and 2019 and I remain confident that we've got road maps in place to go and get those synergies, so. We feel confident about where we are from an expense management standpoint and a synergy realization standpoint.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it, thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities","Thanks, so you guys are doing quite well on listings versus your primary competitor. Wonder if you guys could talk a little bit about that, what's driving the success. And I know you guys have made a lot of investments in the New York Stock Exchange since you've acquired it. Is that having a positive impact?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yes, I think the second part of your question is the answer to the first, which is we've become more focused on it and we've really forced our team there to think about what is it that we do well and sell that, if you will, and allow our competitors to sell what they do well and let the market line up against those facts. In other words, we're not trying to being them and they're not trying to be us and the market is finding its natural home.","What the NYSE does well with that floor-based system is large, complicated multi-national IPOs and it's just what the company is good at and it just so happens that a lot of the companies that are coming to market right now are those kinds of capital raise, and so we're doing well. There's a whole part of the market that we don't do well at that our competitors do better at and so we don't try to force our people to go after the ones that aren't obvious for us and that play to our strengths. It's just like any business, just getting people to focus on what you do well and sell it with passion has really helped the NYSE. And I think at the end of the day, it's just having a little more focus. Tom Farley, his new management team there are doing an excellent job of delivering that culture to the NYSE.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities","Very good. And real quick, I know they're reasonably small but can you guys comment a little bit on the businesses you are acquiring, NSX and Atrium, maybe a little bit about the rationale and what your plans are for those.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Sure. Start with Atrium. One of the things that we inherited and we've talked about before is the network that was around the NYSE called SFTI. It was largely built because Reg NMS required that the exchange have connectivity to the other exchanges and market trading centers. The NYSE very interestingly built that out to lots of exchanges and lots of trading centers. And so it is a SFTI network. The acronym is SFTI but it's appropriately named in that it is not a high speed network that is full of microwaves, it is a network that is incredibly reliable and it's used a lot by people for their secondary business continuity planning. So having that, we've just found that, boy, if we can buy other content like Interactive Data company that we can make available on that network, it's perfect.","We found that Interactive Data company also had needed connectivity to exchanges. So we've offered various feeds across that network, including the data and feeds and access to our competitors. We bought Atrium which was connectivity in Canada to TMX. It's for me, as an engineer, it was almost an overlap of network that we had. So it allows us to move their customer base onto our network and deprecate essentially all of their underlying network connectivity and use the pipes that we already have in place. So a small deal. Should be very accretive for us in the long run. And it gives us a whole new customer base to which to sell other services.","So those are the kind of things that we're thinking about on these bolt-on acquisitions. I use the analogy of television network. We have a great network. But if we can find a hit program or maybe a small program that if we put it on our network, because of the distribution, we can make it a hit. Those are the kind of things that appeal to us. They're small but, as I mentioned, just having more breadth, more customer touch, more diversity in the way we solve financial service solutions is driving growth for us across related assets that we have.","Operator","There are no additional questions at this time. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Sprecher for closing remarks.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Thank you, Kate.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please also note, today's event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Kelly Loeffler. Please go ahead.","Kelly Loeffler - Senior Vice President, Corporate Communications, Marketing & Investor Relations","Good morning. ICE's first quarter 2016 earnings release and presentation can be found on both the homepage and the Investors section of theice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay.","Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2015 Form 10-K.","In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including adjusted income, adjusted operating margin, expenses, EPS, EBITDA, and tax rate. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP term in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful, as well as how management uses these measures. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses, and adjusted earnings refer to adjusted diluted earnings per share.","With us on the call this morning are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Chuck Vice, President and Chief Operating Officer.","I'll now turn the call over to Scott.","Scott A. Hill - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Kelly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As Kelly mentioned, the slides to which we'll refer this morning can also be found on the ICE homepage. I'll begin on slide four of that presentation where you'll see that we delivered another record quarter, including adjusted earnings per share, which rose 20% as reported versus the first quarter of 2015.","As this is the first full quarter including recent acquisitions, unless otherwise noted, year-over-year figures will reflect comparisons against adjusted pro forma first-quarter 2015 results. On that basis, ICE's first-quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share grew 19% to a record $3.68. Both our trading and clearing segment and our data and listing segment contributed meaningfully to first-quarter revenues, which in total, grew 5% to $1.2 billion.","This solid revenue performance combined with disciplined expense management allowed us to expand operating margins by five points to 59%. Equally important, these results helped generate strong operating cash flows, which enabled us to pay over $100 million in dividend, up 14% from the fourth quarter, while also allowing us to significantly reduce our leverage, which stood at only 2.5 times just three months post the closing of the Interactive Data transaction.","Moving to slide five, you'll see the component of our strong earnings growth. Revenue growth of 5% combined with a 6% decline in adjusted operating expenses generated adjusted operating income growth of 14%. Net income attributable to ICE grew 18%, and we delivered our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth.","We achieved these strong results despite a challenging quarter for institutional trading desks, continued regulatory change, and while executing on a range of strategic initiatives. From the integration of previously-acquired companies and continued product and technology innovation to evaluations of additional value-enhancing M&A opportunities. We remain committed to generating strong financial performance in the current period, even as we develop strategies to enhance our returns on investment in the future.","Turning now to slide six, I'll walk through our new segment reporting. First quarter consolidated revenues increased 5% year-over-year to nearly $1.2 billion. The chart on the left side of the slide shows our revenues were evenly split between our trading and clearing segment and our data and listing segment.","Turning to the table on the right side of the slide, you'll note a similar balance of growth across the diverse line items that constitute each segment. For example, as shown on the table, total trading and clearing segment revenues grew 4% year-to-year, with solid contributions from both commodities and financials, which grew 5% and 4% respectively. Within those balanced results, ICE Brent, sugar, Euribor and U.S. cash equities each grew double digits.","Our data and listing segment revenues grew 5% in the first quarter. Our pricing and analytics revenues were up 6% and exchange data revenues were up 9%, both driven primarily by new users and new products. As these results demonstrate we are already seeing the expected acceleration in the growth of the legacy interactive data price reference data business.","This strong start further supports our confidence that our data revenues can grow 6% to 7% on a pro forma basis for the full-year 2016.","Finally, listings revenues grew 3% over the prior first quarter, despite a quiet IPO environment. The growth in the first quarter and our confidence in our listings business will continue to grow throughout 2016 is due to our clear leadership and capital raising activity at the NYSE over the last few years. And I'm pleased to say that we've already seen a handful of IPOs early in 2Q and our pipeline continues to build.","Let's shift to slide seven where I'll cover our disciplined expense management and provide an update on expense guidance and synergies.","First quarter adjusted operating expenses declined 6% year-over-year to $476 million and pro forma operating margin expanded by five points. Our first quarter expenses included higher-than-usual M&A related spending, but that was largely offset by some 2015 credits and compensation and professional services.","The period also benefited from the release of roughly $11 million of non-income tax related reserves, which was partially offset by a few non-operating expenses below the operating income line. More importantly, even adjusting for these impacts, we would have been below our expense guidance as we once again realized synergies sooner-than-expected.","This strong first quarter expense performance and our updated synergy expectations result in us lowering our full-year expense guidance to between $1.97 billion and $2.0 billion. This improved guidance reflects expected 2016 expense synergies of $85 million to $90 million, that's up from prior guidance of $75 million, and this includes $30 million to $35 million from Interactive Data, which has also improved from prior guidance of $25 million.","For the second quarter, we expect expenses in the range of $495 million to $505 million. The second quarter will be the first one to reflect the full impact of 2016 compensation increases and we will also see a pickup in investments related to business development and CapEx. I'll conclude my remarks on slide eight with a review of our solid cash generation, improving leverage profile and ongoing capital return.","We generated nearly $600 million of operating cash flow during the first quarter, which enabled us to invest in growth even as we reduced our debt by over $500 million and returned over $100 million to our shareholders through dividends. As a result of our strong cash flow generation, we reduced our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA from 2.8 times at the end of 2015 to 2.5 times at the end of the first quarter.","We now believe we can reduce our leverage below 2 times by early next year, which we think is sufficient to maintain our current debt rating, while also creating more flexibility for additional capital returns.","We also increased our first quarter dividend payout by 14% versus the fourth quarter, consistent with our commitment to grow the dividend as we grow our earnings. Our record first-quarter results show our continued focus and execution across our businesses.","We delivered solid revenue growth, strong operating margin expansion, and once again, double-digit earnings growth. And importantly, we see strong demand from our customers and encouraging trends across the markets we serve.","I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A, but for now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Scott, and good morning to everyone on the call. The first quarter of 2016 was the best quarter in our company's history for both revenue and earnings. And it was our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth. We delivered 20% earnings per share growth in the quarter, as a result of expanding our revenues and reducing expenses, and while making investments for long-term growth. These strong results demonstrate our consistent focus on increasing our top line, expense discipline, cash flow generation, returns on invested capital, and our capital returns.","This morning we announced our decision to end our current review of a potential offer for the London Stock Exchange Group. We thought that the combination may have a compelling rationale, including bringing together the premier transatlantic capital raising venues, offering complementary interest rate and financial products, and providing widespread equity LIBOR and fixed-income indices, together with extensive market data.","So, over the last year members of our board and our advisers attempted unsuccessfully to arrange meetings through the LSE Chairman to discuss these ideas. Then, following our public expression in March of interest under the U.K. takeover code, the LSE Chairman and CEO did not engage with ICE.","Notwithstanding, we spent the last two months reviewing the data that we were provided with our financial advisors, auditors and legal and regulatory experts to determine whether our operations, expense basis and governance structures would result in a strategic combination that would meet ICE's return on investment thresholds, while offering LSE shareholders a meaningful share price premium.","The disappointing level of engagement of the LSE ultimately did not allow us to make a complete determination of the integration benefits and their related risks that ICE would require to support a bid.","We are committed to building on our track record of creating shareholder value by achieving the targets that we set at the outset of our strategic transactions. Because we were unable to establish to our satisfaction the financial models, risk undertakings and integration plans needed to set such targets, we're turning our focus to other opportunities to build on our track record of growth.","As our results today show, our deliberations did not get in the way of ICE growing its revenues, increasing synergies, reducing expenses, utilizing our strong cash flows to de-lever and increasing our dividend. I'm proud that our team has once again delivered strong operational results and the best quarter in our history, even as we considered strategic opportunities. And I'll now highlight some of the opportunity set that we have starting on slide nine.","Our team has driven a range of new initiatives in recent months. From launching our Singapore exchange and clearing house to introducing new equities trading platforms and issuer services at NYSE to expanding our data valuation and network businesses, each of these initiatives is on track, thanks to our global team that drives these efforts.","So let's start with data, which is our most recent area of expansion. It's worth noting that 10 years ago, in 2006, 11% of our consolidated revenues were derived from market data. Today, 41% of our revenues are from our data business, where the breadth of our products and services continue to expand.","We're already seeing the benefits of enhancing the consistency of our revenues with solid margin and growth profile that subscription revenues bring. We've long seen the trend of more data and connectivity consumption as markets became more automated, regulated and cleared. And we've been an early mover in addressing the rising demand for information and analytics across virtually all asset classes.","This is similar to our recognition of clearing becoming a central piece of market infrastructure a decade ago. And I'd like to note that even today the category of exchange data, which is our tradition proprietary data, is still 11% of our significantly expanded total revenue base; and it continues to grow alongside of our highly-complementary trading and clearing businesses.","We've previously discussed the secular drivers of rising data demand, including regulatory reform, automation, unbundling, fragmentation and the move towards passive investing and indexation, just to name a few. These secular trends are also driving growth and the other recent additions to our data business, pricing and analytics, desktops and connectivity.","Our acquisitions over the last three years including NYSE Euronext, SuperDerivatives, Interactive Data and Trayport bring a unique range of assets to support our growth. Our new services range from real-time bond pricing and indices to global infrastructure for exchange and broker connectivity to widely distributed desktops.","We continue to make great progress on the advancement of Interactive Data since its closing in December. Last month we launched the ICE U.S. Treasury indices to leverage the index business that was part of the NYSE with the capabilities we found at Interactive Data, and we're in the process of aligning our global sales and shared services teams to better serve our customers and realize efficiencies.","Moving now to slide 10, I'll note that growth in our global markets and clearing houses continues. Just as with data, there are similar secular growth opportunities as the markets continue to evolve. Customers are increasingly adopting hedging practices, as well as more recently, seeking those solutions to do so in the most capital-efficient manner.","And hedging is needed regardless of price levels of commodities. Nearly two years ago when oil prices began falling, many suggested that trading and clearing volumes would decline with prices. The reality is just the opposite, because absolute price levels tend not to drive risk management activities, volatility does.","In our global oil and agricultural products, we've seen consistent demand for the risk management that our exchanges and clearing houses offer. Our core benchmark contracts continued their growth and innovation. For example, ICE Brent Futures set volume, revenue and open interest records in the quarter, and spawned the launch of a Brent contract to better serve our Asian customers at ICE Futures Singapore.","Growth in our agricultural markets were once again led by our world sugar contract, with revenue up 17% over the prior first quarter. Our financial markets ranging from European rates to global index benchmarks to credit markets also continued to strengthen.","In our Euribor contract, which is Europe's short-term interest rate benchmark, revenue increased 34% year-to-year on Central Bank actions and the dynamics around the euro, pound and dollar.","Volume in our equity index complex across FTSE, MSCI and Russell grew over the prior first quarter, consistent with our cash equities and actuary options markets where volatility continued to drive growth.","I'll wrap up our strategic highlights on slide 11 with an update on our achievements at the New York Stock Exchange where we're delivering on the synergies that we promised, as well as driving new revenue growth.","Our investment in new systems coupled with simplifying our offerings continues to create a better market structure for market participants. In U.S. cash equities, we had a record quarter with strong volume and market share that continued to grow, coupled with strong revenue capture. We led in ETP listings, with 82% of the new assets under management choosing to list with NYSE this quarter. And we maintained listings for 92% of all U.S. ETP assets under management.","We continue to be the premier listing venue due to our liquidity, tight bid\/ask spreads, and the amount of time that these securities trade at the national best bid and offer price on our exchange. We're working closely with ETP issuers to help enable their ongoing innovation to grow this investment category.","In our NYSE listings business, revenue grew despite the quiet quarter for IPOs. And we have great momentum with an IPO pipeline that began to open up in April. We're expanding issuer services and rolling out our new NYSE Connect platform to our listed companies later this month.","These services are an important part of the value proposition that we bring to our listed companies and these are not a revenue line item for us, but part of what drives our leadership in listings. There remains no more trusted model for our issuers, which is why the NYSE is growing with the first quarter representing the best quarter in its 224-year history.","I'll close on slide 12 noting our track record of growth, execution and results. This year has already been a productive one, just one quarter in. We reviewed and chose not to pursue the LSE transaction. We grew revenues, reduced expenses and increased synergies. We continued to expand margins and drove double-digit earnings growth. And we invested for growth, repaid debt and returned dividend capital.","So I'd like to thank our customers for their business in what was the best quarter in our company's history. And I'd like to thank our team for their continued hard work. My colleagues and I look forward to continuing to update you on our progress throughout the year.","And with that, I'll now turn the call back to our operator, Rocco, who'll be glad to turn you on so that we can take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Michael Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, guys. Hey, Jeff, just given the announcement today and looking at kind of the growth initiatives that are in front of you, just wanted to focus on the data and I think the clearing side of the business. It looks like you're seeing some good traction. I think the outlook for that 6% to 7% growth. Just wanted to get an indication you mentioned new users driving some of that, I know you guys are been active on producing new products and services, but any indication of what's driving that? Where you're seeing that increased demand? I know there's a lot of regulatory changes whether it's on the banks and the FCMs or on their clients, in terms of trying to figuring out, how to hedge, how to clear, in this kind of dynamic and changing landscape? So just wanted to get a sense on, where you that playing out, and any kind of incremental granularity that you can provide? Thanks.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Let me start and then I'm going to ask Scott to give you a little more detail behind the numbers. But when you step back, one of the changes that I've noticed at ICE is that when we acquired Creditex, Creditex had a platform that was once called T-Zero, today it's called ICE Connect that was connected to hundreds of buy-side participants. And we continue to grow that connectivity since we acquired the firm and used that to link the buy-side to our clearing houses.","Then when we acquired SuperDerivatives and ultimately Interactive Data, we acquired sales teams that had even more connection to the buy side. And at the New York Stock Exchange every quarter we have large quarterly meetings with significant buy-side participants that I also attend, as well as many of my colleagues.","And so long story short, what has gradually happened in our company is that we've been able to broaden our footprint and our touch-points to ultimate end users, and they are the ones that are really driving the growth of more screens and more consumption of information.","Scott A. Hill - Chief Financial Officer","And I think we tried in our data and listing segment to break out the revenue lines to give you a perspective along the lines of what Jeff described. If you noticed in the quarter, our desktops and connectivity revenues were up 3% and that's more people wanting to get connected to us and once they're connected to us that allows them to consume the data products that we're selling and the breadth of the offering that we've got continues to grow and then that translates up into what you saw in our pricing business that grew 6% and our exchange data business that grew 9%.","I've talked to you over the years and I look at it every single month, what's going on with the number of users around our exchanges and that tends to be driven by what's going on in the oil markets or the commodity markets generally. And that line has continued to trend up, but now by being able to supplement that with the business that we bought at Interactive Data to offer more products through a seamless and secure connection, that combination gives us the confidence that the overall business will grow 6% to 7% for the year, which is an acceleration of what we've seen over the last year or so and also versus what we saw at Interactive Data in their history.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's good. And then, Scott, just on the expense guidance, I get the lower for the year, in terms of the synergy recognition. Just wanted to understand, I think you mentioned just in the 2Q, the pick-up that we're seeing just on a sequential basis. Did you say that's more driven by just the annual comp and some CapEx? And then, I think \u2013 I don't know if there was anything in 1Q that depressed the number, but I just wanted to make sure we were clear on that?","Scott A. Hill - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. That's a good question. There's a little bit of noise in the first quarter expense, so I appreciate you asking it. So, it's really driven by two things primarily, first of all, in the first quarter as I mentioned, we had the release of a non-income tax reserve of about $11 million, those happen from time to time. The size or timing is difficult to predict. So that's not something we would expect to repeat in the second quarter. And so that would cause a natural increase in SG&A quarter-to-quarter.","And then the second part of it is what you mentioned, the compensation increases really don't kick in for us until March. And so effectively, in 2Q, 3Q and 4Q you get a full quarter versus one month and that would push comp up probably $9 million to $10 million on a quarter-to-quarter basis. And embed in there as well is an R&D tax credit that we had in the first quarter. So overall, those are really the two key drivers that move you up quarter-to-quarter. My expectation is, in the range, we'll probably be in the lower part of that range in the second quarter, and then we'll stay within that range trending slightly higher within it as we move through the rest of the year.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And our next question comes from Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Yeah. Good morning, Jeff; good morning, Scott, and congrats on the...","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","...congrats on the improved guidance both revenues and expenses. So my first question, Jeff, is when you described the LSE transaction, clearly in the frustration sort of rung out. And it seemed that like that you're pulling out of the bidding, not based on the merits or the fundamentals, but rather the engagement that you've received from the LSE. So I guess, the question is, is there any other legal avenues to pursue, or is there \u2013 what does the UK takeover law provide that if the engagement was there, to allow you to evaluate the transaction like you want to?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thanks for the question. I think the point I really want to make is that we have a history of doing M&A deals, and we have a very strong history of delivering on whatever we say we're going to do at the outset, and that's an important metric that we have here on how we want to talk to our shareholders, partly why I think we've had permission from our shareholders to do M&A as that we've earned their trust that we will deliver what we say we're going to do and that they can count on it.","And so, when we can't get visibility and don't have confidence, it makes it very, very hard for us to look our shareholders in the eye and suggest that we are going to deliver a specific amount of performance. And I don't have anything under the takeover code that's going to change that perception. It takes engagements in order to come to those kinds of determinations. And I'll just leave it at that.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay, all right. And I guess my follow-up question, Jeff, would be, again having to do with the UK, but the Competition and Markets Authority they've announced they've launched an in-depth, I guess, what they term an in-depth investigation into the Trayport transaction. Can you talk about that? It's already closed. I know it's unusual circumstances, but what's your position, and does that put the Trayport platform at risk, I guess?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. First of all, it's actually not unusual circumstances. The way the UK takeover works is that they have a period of time after closing to review a deal. So we fully expected that review, in the way the process works. And frankly, obviously, we're cooperating fully, and we believe that ultimately the CMA is not going to object to us owning Trayport in the way we operate it.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay, all right. Thanks for the color. I appreciate it.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Alex Kramm of UBS. Please go ahead.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","So, just coming back to the LSE discussion for a minute. I think when those discussions first started, I think the initial view investors took was like, oh my God, competition is going to increase substantially when Deutsche and LSE get together. So I'm curious about your view of how you view your competitive position if those two actually end up getting together, which I guess, is not a foregone conclusion. But also in terms of the integration challenges that they might have, kind of like the combining clearing houses, different cultures, so maybe any opportunities that you can capitalize on, while these guys might be a little bit distracted over the next couple of years?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Well, first of all, I don't want to comment too much because they're going to go through a competition review that's going to open up a lot of opportunity for the entire market to comment on competition issues. And so I don't want to prejudge any of that. But with respect to their offering, it's been very unclear to us what is being offered. And so I don't know how to react to it.","Let me just make one point of color about our company, unrelated to them. I want to be very clear, I'm talking about ICE. ICE operates clearing houses around the world. We operate largely on a common technology platform. We have global customers that we serve, and in many of our clearing houses we have highly similar or highly correlated products. If it was easy to figure out how to net that down, we would be doing it because we have every incentive in the world to offer the best offering that we can for our customer base.","The reality is that in different jurisdictions there are different bankruptcy regimes and when we \u2013 just as we saw when MF Global collapsed, the way people were treated in the U.S. as soon as the court stepped in and the administers, and the way people were treated in our clearing houses outside the U.S., was very different, even though the products were similar, the customers were similar and the risks were similar.","And so these things complicate the ability to do cross-border integrations. We continue to work on it. We've been actually working on that topic for years. Had lots of dialogue with regulators and customers on how it might be accomplished, but it is a very difficult problem to solve because at the end of the day, people don't want money in flight cross-border at the moment of bankruptcy, and regulators tend to come in and regulate locally during these moments of stress. And that's just a fact that all of us are trying to figure out how to work around.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you for that limited color you can give, I guess. And then secondly, on the data side, just coming back to ask one question \u2013 actually one quick one for Scott as well. Scott, the 6% to 7% guidance on data, I assume that's organic. That doesn't include whatever you are buying from S&P, which I believe is $100 million annualized revenues, so just clarify that?","And then for you, Jeff, on a bigger picture, you mentioned integration of sales teams, and really getting, selling IDC products again. When we talked to management of IDC last year before you owned them, it sounded like they had really been focused inwards, and getting the products right, and not really selling. So just wondering where you are in that process of actually selling again. And just as one anecdote, we talked to one bank the other day, they said they don't even know who their IDC salesperson is. So it seems like some things can still need some fixing, so maybe just tell us where you are in the process? Thanks.","Scott A. Hill - Chief Financial Officer","So I'll be quick and then I'll hand it over to Jeff. The 6% to 7% is pro forma growth for the businesses we currently own. So it doesn't include any businesses that we will own in the future, and I'd also taken opportunity to repeat what I said on the last earnings call that, that 6% to 7% for the year will also reflect market data revenue that we anticipate will accelerate sequentially as we move through the year as well.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And on your question, I think you're market intelligence and feedback is spot on, which is at Interactive Data, they have various ranges of products and have various salespeople that specialize in those products, but they did not have an overall comprehensive way of touching customers.","If you add that to ICE that has SuperDerivatives, that has people at the NYSE, that has other connectivity, has our ICE Link platform. We have people selling clearing and exchange data solutions. We also have all these various touch points. And so the real effort that's going on now is to bring everyone together, so that we have single points of contact for our large customers, so that they know how to get access to the entire suite of products that we have. And we can see already that that's just in the early stages and we can see already that just the work that we've done alone around IDC has improved our sales function, and has allowed our revenues to grow and we think it's only going to get better.","It's a high priority for us because we really do believe that this company grows by having a close relationship to our customers because they end up giving us ideas and ask \u2013 tell us about their problems and give us an opportunity to create solutions that they will ultimately acquire from us. And so it's very, very high priority and it's the work that's going on right now. It's also part of why Scott was able to increase his synergy guidance because we really do believe we will have a much tighter integrated team as we go through this year.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Very helpful. Thank you.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hopefully, year from now when we get back on, you'll have different market color about us.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","That's the idea. Thanks.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. I appreciate your hesitation on two of the previous questions. I'm going to try again because I think it's important. I'll try to ask the questions a little differently. Maybe how certain do you think it is that Deutsche Boerse and LSE get approval to merge or maybe do see a lot of risk or challenge to this merger?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think at the end of the day we have no idea. So, it's an easy answer to give you. It's their challenge to demonstrate why they should be allowed to merge and we'll be a passive audience in appreciating what they do.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then, it would seem possible that merging a futures business and an OTC clearing platform could appear threatening to your futures business. Is there any way to give us comfort that maybe that merger is not threatening like, these futures businesses are very sticky, we've seen a lot of competition come in before, it hasn't really been able to rip apart our futures business. But again, this seems a little different. Maybe why is this the same thing we've seen over and over again, and not a threat?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Well, first of all, I'd note that we've been growing our interest rate futures business in Europe. I think it was 34% year-over-year. So that's a franchise that we continue to invest in and have had great results with. We compete with other people that have already offered the solution that you just described. And so we're already competing against that kind of offering. Just stepping back, if you say how many people in the world are there that have OTC interest rate swaps that are fully or largely offset with futures contracts; in other words, that they've completely hedged out their risk. The people that do that are not end users. The people that do that are dealers, people that are offering something to one party and then immediately hedging it out so that they take out risk.","That dealer community is under pressure as you, I'm sure, know. It's been shrinking, if you look at announcements that are going on. And so, it's unclear that the paradigms of the past necessarily are going to be the paradigms of the future. And so we're trying to build out our franchise. We've launched a lot of new products to serve our customers, as we anticipate continual changes in the way that these financial businesses operate, but other than that, we're competing in that world today and we're doing really well.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Very helpful. I appreciate it.","Operator","And our next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, good morning. A couple of weeks ago the European Securities and Markets Authority talked about how they didn't see a need for a 30-month delay for the implementation of open access rules in Europe. Curious about your updated thoughts on those open access rules and how it would impact ICE?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Well, we've been living with \u2013 the whole industry has been living with the prospect of these rules being implemented now for many, many years. So we continue to get our businesses ready to be responsive to those rules. I think the way it impacts the entire market is that there is a goal to create more competition, which to you and I means, more fragmentation of markets. We also think that it will be very, very difficult and hard and very little incentive for any third party to start a major clearing house when the existing clearing houses have open access. So in an odd way, while it's meant to stimulate competition, it at the end of the day, probably entrenches the incumbents, including ICE who has a large clearing presence in Europe.","So we continue to build out our capabilities inside that clearing house, to get ready for access. And we've continued to make sure that the ancillary services that we provide around the trading venues, where we do believe there will be fragmentation, offer a lot of capabilities to our end users. So you've seen us take on the ability to create more indices, improve our data offerings, improve the kind of consultative compliance services that we offer to our customers, we've worked hard on improving our delivery mechanisms for physical products and all those kinds of things, which will all largely become unbundled as the market fragments and create opportunities for us.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yes, that's helpful. Thank you. And then my follow-up, can you just kind of talk about the competitive dynamics right now in energy futures trading? Obviously, you have the established competitor, you have a new start up there. So what are the dynamics that you are seeing in terms of market share and order routing, particularly in the key products Brent, WTI, and natural gas?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Well, we have best quarter in our history, so yes there is competition. But clearly, in terms of our ability to deliver financial results we're doing very, very well. We sit with record open interest in Brent as I mentioned. And so we have very high prospects for that franchise going forward.","There are always going to be entrants to this business, as I think I've mentioned in other kinds of businesses, people have this figured out ways of expanding the market, that expansion, while it benefits them, also has side benefits, oftentimes that benefit us. And I think you're seeing that in the numbers.","As fragmented markets in my mind are bad for end users, they are very good for intermediaries. They create much more arbitrage capability that brings a new kind of arbitrageur to the market that wants the leg in all of the various different venues, which drives volume.","And so, ICE really doesn't care about market share. We really want to have people that want to value our services and pay us to provide them. And so that's the market that we focus on, which is a subset of what you're talking about, and we're doing really, really well in the market for people that want to pay for services and that's why we continue to grow.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great, thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, guys. Questions on the synergies, as you guys get through 2016 and we start looking at 2017, can you remind us maybe how much more synergies are left to come out at that point and maybe qualitatively where they'll come out?","Scott A. Hill - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. What we said on the last call was that by the end of 2018 that we would be largely through the remaining $220 million of synergies that we had to go. That was the $150 million of IDC in the $70 million of NYSE. I'll note again what I said then, which is, what is IDC and what is ICE and what is NYSE, it continues to blur. So, we're really focused on delivering on that $220 million expense reduction, again largely accomplished by the end of 2018. We had mentioned last call $75 million of that would come out this year, we increased that now to $85 million to $90 million, and so our expectation to raise there.","We announced that Ben Jackson has taken over as the Chief Commercial Officer and he and the teams have been in with IDC 24\/7 over the last two or three months, once we closed the deal, and continue to make progress in identifying the specific actions to deliver the synergies this year. And they're working on building the 2017 execution plan as well. So, as we move through this year, as we get better visibility, we'll talk to about that. What I would simply conclude is, of the $220 million, by the end of 2018 we're going to get $85 million to $90 million this year and we're very confident that we will deliver on that objective over time.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Very good. And then just a quick follow-up on the expenses for this year. Just wanted to confirm that in the guidance you guys haven't deferred or delayed any investment spending that you previously were guiding too?","Scott A. Hill - Chief Financial Officer","We have not. We continue to make those investments, and it's one of the reasons why we're confident in our ability to grow our data business 6% to 7% this year, because as we reduce expenses through synergies, it in no way impedes our ability to invest in future growth.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got you. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Vincent Hung of Autonomous. Please go ahead.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Hi. The question on the capital structure, what is the right capital structure now for the business given it's 50% recurring revenues? And shouldn't the target leverage ratio be higher than 1.5 times, in that context?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That's a really good question, and we've been involved in extensive dialogues with the ratings agencies over the past few months on exactly your point, which is, the business model that ICE had and the financial structure and capital structure that ICE had when we did the NYSE deal back in 2013 versus where we sit today in 2016 is very different.","Pre-NYSE, 80% to 90% of our revenues were volume based. Post-NYSE, it was still 70% to 75%. We are now at a point where our annuity like businesses are about half our revenues, which introduces significant stability into the financial model.","You saw the very strong cash flows in the first quarter. While you can't multiply that times four because it's got our annual listings billing in it, we clearly are on track to a number that's going to be around $2 billion of operating cash flows for the year, which you'll note is significantly above where we were the prior year.","Our CapEx needs have grown slightly, and so even netting that out, our free cash flows are very significant. You saw in the quarter alone, we were able to knock three tenth of a point of leverage out in the first quarter. And so I think all of that summed up is why I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we're now comfortable once we get below 2 times leverage, which we think we can do late this year or certainly early next year, we believe that will support our overall rating. And that rating is important to us, and so we're going to do the things that are necessary to support it.","But as you mentioned, I don't think 1.5 times is that bogey anymore given what we've done. I think we could comfortably operate about 1.75 times, 1.80 times and again below 2 times I think we're back active looking at ways to return additional capital to our shareholders and we're looking forward to doing that.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Okay and just the last question. Can you give us more clarity on the IBA and monetization of the LIBOR, (46:39)?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, I mean, I'll update you in the financial sense in that on a year-over-year basis that business contributed well in the quarter. We had seen good growth as we moved through the back half of last year, and the first quarter results were solid as well. It is still largely around the LIBOR business, but as we continue to build out ICE swap and the gold fix and other of those products, we would expect the contributions from the business to continue to improve as we move through this year.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question is from Kyle Voigt of KBW. Please go ahead.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Jeff, I just wanted to follow up on earlier question regarding the UK takeover code. So, in order for you to be able to make a bid for LSE within the next six months, you outlined four circumstances in the press release. But the release also says that you'll be able to bid with consent of the UK Panel on Takeovers and Mergers. So under what circumstance could the panel consent to this? If the LSE approached you, and was more open to share information at that point, do you believe the panel would be open to you making a bid? Or is this out of the question now that you've made this announcement today?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I wanted to first of all point out to you that the form and substance of the way we put that release out was really a relatively standardized form and the four points that you've outlined are really available to all participants generally in any UK takeover situation.","So you shouldn't read anything into the fact that we mentioned those four in terms of trying to get in our heads on contemplating where we go from here. Those are all available to us and to anyone else in our position in other deals and we'll just have to see how life progresses, but don't read anything beyond the written words there into our actions.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. And then just a follow-up, on the two acquisitions that you announced from S&P, can you just talk about those acquisitions, how they fit in? And then can you confirm whether you will be paying for those in cash now that you've taken yourself out of the bidding for LSE?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, so each of those \u2013 the acquisition of the business from S&P that you noted is, I think we discussed earlier, it's right now going through an anticipated competition review. We suspect it will work its way through this year, and remain confident that we get to closing around that timing. As we get closer to the end of the year, and the close of that deal, we'll be back to you to say a little bit more about what its contributions will be to our financial statements and how ultimately we'll fund it. You will likely have noted when we announced the deal that we noted that we had the flexibility to pay in either cash or stock at the time of the closing, obviously which we choose will depend on when the closing happens and what else happens between now and then.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Just to go back on the market data business in terms of the 6% to 7% growth rate guidance. Either Jeff or Scott, can you talk a little bit about sort of the more granular dynamics of that in terms of revenue synergies with the IDC products across the ICE platform, like how much is included in that assumption, and is that something that's much more of a 2017 event? And also, I'm sorry, also Trayport as well?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Well, first of all, there are tremendous synergies across the range of businesses that we've acquired recently, and that's really what our plans call for us doing is unlocking those synergies \u2013 the revenue synergy opportunities across them. But just by way of example, we launched these new treasury indices at IDC, but we were able to develop those using a very strong team that we have at the NYSE that has very intimate relationships with large ETP and ETF providers. So we are able to very quickly have a dialogue with a unique customer base over their new product sets, their ideas and how they're going to grow that market and what capabilities we may have to support them that neither company as a standalone had on their own, and it was amazing that we were able to put that together within the first month or so of ownership and it's paying dividends.","Obviously, we announced very quickly that BlackRock was moving some large ETP products on to those indices and now our team is out working with a lot of other providers and users of indices to advance and accelerate those products. I would just make the point to that much of this data revenue that we're talking about is subscription based, which gives Scott the ability to have great confidence when he tells you that it's going to grow at 6% to7% this year because many of those contracts are being signed or have already been signed, so we have tremendous visibility into them. Those tend to recur, so that's the nice thing about that model. So looking forward, we would hope that we're doing a good job with those customers that they will continue to re-sign with us. And meanwhile we take the products that we've developed out on the road and find new customers for them so that we can have growth on growth.","Scott A. Hill - Chief Financial Officer","And just adding slightly to that and touching on the end of your question, the thing that excites me about this is the 6% to 7% this year is really based on the strong performance of the individual parts. All of the effort to come together and to integrate and work together, as Jeff talked about, we'll get some that yield in the year, but it's really that's about what's going to enable us to grow in 2017 and 2018 and beyond. So that's why we've got confidence not just in the near term where the businesses are doing well this year, but in the longer term where we think as the companies come together the opportunities for growth will only expand.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. That's great color. And then maybe just switching gears a little bit to the ETF listings, in terms of some recent competition on offering, basically paying for listings, and using obviously the trading combination to make money on that. How do you feel about that, or how do you see that, or do you \u2013 I guess, do you see that as a threat to the ETF listings franchise longer term for you?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, you know that kind of intense competition has been in the market for a while and you can see the results that we posted, which is we're doing phenomenally well. When you step back and look at payment for order flow, while it became accepted within the intermediary community around the equities market, giving equity kickbacks to large institutions that have very strong brands and are trying to appeal to retail customers in an era where the SEC and the labor department and others are very concerned that retail investors be given good guidance as to how their money is being handled.","It's a real reputational brand risk for somebody to step into that quagmire. It would beg the question, did somebody create a product simply to generate churn inside of it and get these equity kickbacks or was that really the best listing venue? What I will tell you is that all of us in financial services are under pressure by new regulation and also just best practices to make sure that we have no single point of failure in our businesses. And the big institutional investment firms are subject to those same kinds of reviews and pressure.","So we expect that in that ETP, ETF market that people will, for diversity purposes, list across a range of venues. But it's not really economically driven. It's really diversity driven. We have such a strong offering with 92% of AUM at NYSE and you could see with \u2013 in the face of the pressure you talked about, 82% of the AUM that was listing in the first quarter came to us. The reason that that is such a strong venue is that we have very, very deep liquidity on the exchange, the NYSE Arca exchange where we list these platforms, market makers, infrastructures are rule set that really enables these innovative and fabulous listings to come to us and know that they have every opportunity for growth and success.","NYSE is a brand that is known around the world, and we have been pass-ported into most countries, and so the platform that we can offer somebody in terms of distribution is really unparalleled. And it's those things that are driving the listings. I don't believe that payment for order flow is going to have a material impact on this business nor should it. And I also, as you probably know, think it's a corrosive mechanism that actually ultimately hurts markets and so hopefully I'm right and we won't see that corrode these really neat, innovative ETPs that are coming out.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. That's great color. Thank you very much","Operator","And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to the management team for any closing remarks.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Rocco. I appreciate your help on the call. And thank you all for joining us today. We're going to look forward to updating you on our progress as we move through the balance of the year. Have a good day.","Operator","And thank you, sir. This concludes today's conference. We thank you all for attending today's presentation.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Warren Gardiner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Warren Gardiner - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Good morning. ICE's third quarter 2018 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the theice.com. These items will be archived, and our call will be available for replay.","Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements which we undertake no obligation to update represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2017 Form 10-K. In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures including adjusted income, EPS, operating income, operating margin, expenses, tax rate, organic revenue and EBITDA. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more effective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent non-GAAP term to GAAP term in the earnings materials and explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful; as well as how management uses these measures in our Form 10-Q.","When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction based expenses, and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain items. Also, with us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Ben Jackson, our President.","I'll now turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Thanks, Warren. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll start on slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our third quarter performance. ICE's consolidated third quarter net revenues increased 5% year-over-year to $1.2 billion. Trading & Clearing net revenues were $558 million, up 7% year-over-year. Data & Listings revenues totaled $642 million, an increase versus last year of 6% on an organic constant currency basis. Adjusted operating expenses totaled $521 million for the quarter and adjusted operating margins were 57%.","I'll pause here to note that in early October we exercised our option to acquire the remaining minority stake in MERS, which will be the foundation of ICE Mortgage Services. Going forward, ICE Mortgage Services will be reported in operating results and included in our Trading & Clearing segment. With the change, other income will be roughly $6 million lower in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. However, we now expect incremental fourth quarter revenue related to ICE Mortgage Services to be in the $17 million to $19 million range with associated expenses of $9 million to $10 million on top of our prior expense guidance.","Continuing with the third quarter highlights, our adjusted tax rate was 21% in the quarter reflecting clarifications around U.S. corporate tax reform and other adjustments which drove a year-to-date true-up in our tax provision. Our adjusted year-to-date tax rate is 23% and we expect the fourth quarter adjusted tax rate to be between 23% and 24%. All of these factors helped generate adjusted earnings per share of $0.85, an increase of 16% from the third quarter of 2017.","Through the first three quarters of 2018, operating cash flows have increased 23% to a record $1.7 billion. We've returned nearly 90% of that cash to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. And we continue to expect to deliver a record $1.7 billion to shareholders during 2018. Finally, please note that this morning we announced a new $2 billion buyback authorization beginning in January of 2019. This new authorization will provide us with capacity for buybacks over the next six quarters, and flexibility to act opportunistically should the need arise. And importantly, we expect to grow the dividend once again in 2019.","Now, please turn to slide 5 where I'll provide an overview of our Trading & Clearing business. Trading & Clearing revenue increased 7% year-over-year in the third quarter. While third quarter volume trends were down versus last year, improvement in our futures and options RPC mitigated that impact. More importantly, open interest continued to trend higher through the third quarter and with one day remaining in October, open interest is tracking up 7% year-over-year and is near its highest level in over five years. This growth has been driven by strength across virtually every asset class.","In oil, open interest is up 8% including WTI OI which is up 12%. For ag, open interest is up 14%. And finally, interest rate's OI is up 15% against the backdrop of continued uncertainty associated with Brexit, EU politics and further central bank action. As we have consistently said, open interest is a helpful guide for gauging the health of our markets and is proving to be a leading indicator of volume growth during volatile periods. And with the recent increase of volatility in many of our markets, you can clearly see the impact of that in the rebound in volumes during September and our strong volume growth in October.","Overall, October futures and options ADV is tracking up 32% versus the prior year. ADV in our energy complex is up 15% year-over-year, led by strength in oil as well as natural gas, which is up 19% year-over-year. Ags and metal volumes are up 48%. And in our financials complex, interest rate volumes are up 53% year-over-year, while equity derivative volume, excluding the Russell contract is up over 75%.","Now, let's move to slide 6 where I'll discuss the Data & Listings segment. Third quarter Data Services revenue grew 6% on an organic constant currency basis to $530 million. This result was consistent with our expectations entering the quarter, despite a small currency headwind and softness related to NYSE session fees within our connectivity business. As we have begun migrating customers to our new and more efficient Pillar technology, some have taken the opportunity to rationalize the number of trading session, a dynamic we expect will continue in the fourth quarter.","Within Data Services, exchange data revenues were up 5% year-over-year on an organic constant currency basis. This was driven by Futures data growth of 6%, reflecting continued interest in our Futures market, even during periods of slower volume activity as in the third quarter.","Moving to Desktops and Connectivity, revenue was up 3% on an organic constant currency basis. Desktop revenues declined versus the prior year, but stabilized sequentially. This was offset by Connectivity and Feeds revenues, which grew 4%, as the impact from the continued consolidation of our legacy network onto the ICE Global Network was mitigated by improved execution and new customer implementation and double-digit growth in our Feeds business.","Finally, Pricing and Analytics revenues, which represent half of our data revenue and nearly a quarter of our total revenue, were up 7.5% on an organic constant currency basis. As you can see on the slide, this is an acceleration from 4% in 2016, 5% in 2017 and 6% in the first half of this year.","Product innovation to meet customers' needs in an evolving market and regulatory environment continues to generate strength in our core pricing and reference data business. And importantly, ASV for pricing and analytics is tracking up nearly 8% year-over-year to start the fourth quarter, giving us confidence and a strong finish to 2018 and continued momentum entering 2019.","Next on slide 7, you'll see the solid contribution from our NYSE business thus far in 2018. Total revenues associated with the NYSE are up 6% on an organic constant currency basis this year. Improved industry volumes and market share gains have yielded trading revenue growth of 8% through the third quarter. We believe that recent technology investments such as Pillar as well as additional trading solutions such as NYSE National and NYSE American, which provide unique liquidity and listing services to small cap growth companies, enhance our position in this very competitive market.","Listings revenues on an organic constant currency basis have grown 6% in 2018. The NYSE remains the premier listing venue for global corporations raising over $25 billion in IPO proceeds year-to-date and has been the venue of choice for 23 of the last 25 IPOs over $1 billion.","And finally, continued investment in both our data and connectivity solutions has helped drive 3% growth in NYSE Data Services revenue this year. Importantly, I'll note that total NYSE revenues, coupled with the business efficiencies we've delivered since our acquisition in 2013, helped generate strong cash flows that are enabling the record shareholder returns in 2018.","In summary, October futures and options volumes in our trading business, which contribute around 30% of our total revenue, are up over 30% versus the prior year, and open interest continues to build and is up 7%. Our Pricing and Analytics revenue, which delivers nearly a quarter of our total revenue, will grow 7% this year. And ASV entering the fourth quarter is up nearly 8%. And the NYSE has grown 6% and is generating strong cash flows.","All of this has combined to allow us to return a record amount of cash to our shareholders, even as we have spent over $1 billion in additional strategic initiatives to enhance our future growth. We're on track to finish 2018 on a strong note and positioned for continued success in 2019.","I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A, but we'll now hand the call over to Ben to provide an update on our bond strategy.","Benjamin R. Jackson - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Thanks, Scott, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'll begin on slide 8.","As technology advances and the regulatory landscape evolves, fixed income market structure is transforming. Participants are increasingly looking for more efficiency and are challenging the traditional model.","With our comprehensive suite of products and services, our growing portfolio of ETF and index solutions and connectivity to over 5,000 customers through our fixed income service offerings, we are uniquely positioned to address these needs and reduce the frictions that exist across the trade lifecycle today.","The first example of this coming to life was the August announcement of our ETF primary trading initiative with BlackRock. The ETF create-redeem process is currently a disconnected workflow, sometimes taking hours, if not a full day, to complete.","Leveraging our industry-leading pricing and reference data, portfolio analytics and our execution technology, we expect to bring to market the ICE ETF Hub, a tool that will improve participant productivity and lay down a foundation for this trillion-dollar industry to continue its robust growth.","A second example has arisen this past quarter. In response to feedback from a number of large ETF sponsors and index fund managers, we launched a portfolio rebalancing service. The service is leveraging our customer network, pricing data, reference data and auction capabilities from ICE Credit Trade.","Some of the world's largest asset managers have already utilized the product, which enables them to efficiently reposition a portfolio against a changing benchmark or to quickly absorb capital flows, while limiting trade friction and tracking error, particularly when those funds are benchmarked to indices underpinned by our leading pricing and reference data.","The third and fourth examples are in response to customer demand in the growing area of electronic execution of micro and OddBot trading. These initiatives will include partnering and connecting to third party order management systems in order to streamline client workflows. Efforts are already underway with a number of providers, including Charles River and Aladdin.","Finally, as the industry gains additional comfort with electronic trading, they are looking to combine the speed, liquidity and execution quality found in our well-established streaming price or click-to-trade protocols with RFQ functionality. While the underlying technology needs are relatively simple compared to our streaming price liquidity tools, RFQ is helpful for larger trade sizes and highly illiquid instruments. So we are working to enhance our existing RFQ capabilities which already represent close to 20% of our volume, and handle over 10,000 requests per day. And we will integrate this enhanced RFQ functionality into our robust all-to-all execution platform, which logged over 800,000 trades in the third quarter of 2018. And so as we look to 2019 and beyond, we see tremendous opportunity to partner with our customers to solve real challenges across this asset class, and I look forward to updating you on our progress in the future.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Thank you, Ben. Good morning to everybody. Before I begin on slide 9, I'd like to address certain issues surrounding the U.S. equity markets. Today, the U.S. equity markets offer the most advanced trading and most transparent data services in the world, services that are critical to market efficiency, resiliency and security and why the costs to trade U.S.-listed equities is the lowest in the world. Today, price information is available equally to retail investors for little to no cost, a direct result of competitive forces across the brokerage and exchange marketplace. And in fact, we believe that the NYSE data costs to the top five Wall Street banks is less than one half of 1% of the nearly $26 billion that they've generated in their equity-related businesses just so far this year.","This is in stark contrast to the state of the equity markets only a few years ago, a state in which the exchanges were owned by many of those same banks and brokers and when access to data and information was discriminatory against those who were not the exchange owners. It was an era that many falsely romanticize. Today, the major U.S. equity exchanges are owned by the public and our for-profit status is a profits interest for the benefit of the public.","Exchange managers, like my colleagues and me, are guided by discipline imposed by free competitive transparent markets. I've really been saddened at recent industry statements suggesting a disbelief in the power of public markets to guide balanced decision-making, suggesting that notwithstanding the rapid investor response of evolution of the U.S. exchanges over the last decade as public companies such free market capitalism is somehow thought not to be in the best interest of investors and our nation.","The current rhetoric fails to acknowledge that it is competition that has caused the estimated total costs to trade for many of the New York Stock Exchange to be [over] 20% lower than a similar trade at the IEX exchange or 30% lower than some dark pools operated by Wall Street banks and brokers. It also fails to acknowledge the impact of our technology investments, which have improved cyber-security, reduced latency, and increased network capacity.","In fact, the price per unit of bandwidth on our network is estimated to be 18% lower than it was just three years ago. At the same time, the consolidated tape known as the SIP now processes an estimated 20 times the number of messages as it did just 10 years ago, and peak messages on the public options tape known as OPRA are estimated to be up five times what they were only five years ago. And market participants have been the beneficiaries of the improved technology and economies of scale that come from operating multiple exchanges.","These accomplishments were all the result of critical technology investments aimed at improving and advancing our public markets, which resulted from competitive public ownership of exchanges, not from regulatory fiat. And they're why we and the SEC are able to sit here today and unequivocally state that all Americans benefit from the most transparent and liquid capital markets in the world, a statement that I hope our regulators consider very thoughtfully before listening to those recommending that we regress to the policies and procedures from the flawed equity markets of a past era.","Let me now shift to the other entrepreneurial growth initiatives that ICE prides itself on, a strategy that has driven value creation for our investors for over a decade. Applying technology information and expertise to a mission of bringing transparency and efficiency to markets is a playbook that we have run since our inception. And we see opportunity to apply that blueprint, not only to the fixed income markets that Ben just discussed, but also in areas such as mortgages and digital assets. This summer, we completed the technology build for MERS, and in early October, we exercised our option to purchase the remaining minority stake. If you're not familiar with MERs or as it will soon be called ICE Mortgage Services, it is an electronic data repository which tracks the changes in residential mortgage servicing rights and the beneficial ownership interests in the United States. Essentially, it is the DTCC for the U.S. mortgage market. Membership spans 5,000 banks, credit unions, servicers, investors and government agencies.","And over the past 17 years, the number of loans registered has grown from 1 million to over 100 million, with over 75% of the newly originated U.S. residential loans being registered on the system. The mortgage market is now looking for efficiencies, and our goal is to help bring some of those efficiencies by electronifying parts of the mortgage workflow. Solutions such as our newly launched eNote and eVault offerings will help reduce paper costs and allow for greater oversight and control of what is a $10 trillion market.","Another opportunity for growth is to help frame out the market for digital assets. We've long studied developments in both blockchain and cryptocurrencies, and in talking with our customers we saw a need for more institutional solutions. In August, we announced the formation of Bakkt which is a new company, designed to enable institutions and consumers to buy, sell, store and spend digital assets on a seamless platform. Bakkt is led by CEO, Kelly Loeffler, who many of you know from her past leadership roles at ICE, and includes a group of premiere partners including BCG, Starbucks, Microsoft and others.","In its first phase, Bakkt will work with ICE's markets and clearing to deliver institutional-grade risk management, physical delivery and warehouse solutions that do not exist today. We're approaching this with a great deal of transparency and we've already gained approval from our Clearing House Risk Committee at ICE clear US. The digital asset risks will be in a segregated waterfall where the separate guaranteed fund is provided by Bakkt instead of the clearing members and we've set up the workflow in a manner in which bank and brokerage members do not have to take possession of crypto assets but are still able to serve their customers in this space. This type of infrastructure is critical to the growth and development of the nascent $200 billion asset class and for it to responsibly continue to innovate over time.","This month, we announced that Adam White will be joining back as its Chief Operating Officer. Adam was one of the first employees at Coinbase and most recently served as their head of institutional markets. And in December, pending CFTC approvals, Bakkt plans to launch its first product, a daily physically-delivered Bitcoin future and a warehouse for storage that leverages the ICE technology and security infrastructure.","Now, if you turn to slide 10, you'll see that uncovering these opportunities and executing on our strategy is why we've grown revenue and earnings for 12 consecutive years. And we lay the foundation for continued growth in the near term as evidenced by our year-to-date results. In the medium term with opportunities such as our new fixed income and ICE Mortgage Services products, and over the longer term with initiatives such as the FinTech innovation at Bakkt.","I'd like to conclude my remarks by thanking our customers for their business and for their trust in the third quarter, and I want to thank my colleagues for their efforts that contributed to another very strong quarter for ICE.","I'll now turn the call back to Carrie, our moderator, to conduct the question-and-answer session which will last until 9:30 AM Eastern Time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question will come from Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Yeah, good morning, Jeff, and good morning, Scott. And first, thanks for the comments on the U.S. equity markets. It seems like there's a lot of distortion and thanks for the information on slide 7 because I think there's been a lot of extremely uninformed information out there on the exchange licenses.","But anyway, let me just change the subject and go do something that's a little bit more optimistic on the fixed income side. I guess, Ben, you are looking at now \u2013 you've added the RFQ sort of model. And I was just trying to see what was the driver. Is this a recognition that RFQ is in place to stay? Or was it just \u2013 or that it will hold a certain portion of the electronic fixed income market? Or was it just because it's so easy to add to your capabilities right now?","Benjamin R. Jackson - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Great question, and thanks, Rich. If you take just a quick step back, I think, at present, the market doesn't fully appreciate the comprehensive suite of services that we're providing to our customers across fixed income. But I'm pleased to say that our customers are starting to realize it. And that's why they're coming to us for solutions like the ETF hub that we've announced with BlackRock and that we've reached out to the industry, and we're getting fantastic response on that. We have the portfolio rebalancing service that we just launched this past quarter and have a large asset manager already utilizing it right out of the gate.","But when you look at it, our strategy of connecting, integrating, and investing in market-leading assets across the fixed income landscape really helps our customers solve comprehensive problems that they're dealing with and inefficiencies that they're dealing with in fixed income, and it starts with pre and post-trade analytics. You have our golden record of reference data for bond terms and conditions. We are the trusted source for pricing, both end-of-day on millions of instruments as well as intraday. Our index and ETF expertise that started with NYSE and was bolstered significantly in fixed income through the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Index acquisition.","And now with our execution venues, the ability for us to provide the choice of executing, whether it's via the efficiency of streaming protocols in highly liquid instruments or for relatively illiquid instruments, where RFQ may be the best option to get that price, or robust auction capabilities. What we're looking to do is to provide as much choice as possible for our customers to execute.","And the reality is \u2013 and you hit it \u2013 is that RFQ is pretty easy to build. When you're building a streaming service, which is where these platforms such as BondPoint and TMC came from, you have to have the ability to handle \u2013 BondPoint, for example, handles 100 million price updates a day. That's substantial. You're dealing with streaming prices, where on BondPoint, 10,000 securities. If you go onto their screen, you can execute a single trade of 250 bonds on both sides.","So you have this robust streaming protocol that's out there that people are choosing and is growing for us. But we felt that. And these platforms have already had an established RFQ mechanism. And we wanted to continue to provide that choice where the market so chooses.","Operator","The next question will come from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. In terms of connectivity, it seems like the SEC focus on data could easily evolve to a more meaningful conversation about connectivity. Could you help us frame the part of your Desktop and Connectivity segment that could or does fall under the Exchange Act of 1934 or Reg NMS? And particularly the portion of your connectivity business, where your critics could suggest you're discriminating against access for trading?","Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yeah, Ken. It's Scott. So our connectivity business, as we've said, is a single business that runs across the ICE Global Network. And so we report it as a single thing because it is a single thing.","And we have customers who connect to us to trade at the NYSE. We have customers who connect to us to consume our data. We have customers who connect to us to trade in our futures markets.","And so we look at it as a single business, if you will, and report it accordingly. And don't really see a need to break it down any further, particularly in a world where it was fairly clear in the remit from the SEC that they didn't challenge whether or not the prices were fair. They simply said, bring us more detail.","And so we don't look at it as a business under threat or under pressure. We look at it simply as a business that may require us to provide a bit more information in the future. And one, I'll point out, that continues to see capacity growth. Our capacity growth on a year-to-date basis is up 12%. Jeff mentioned the cost per unit of capacity is coming down significantly, but the business overall continues to grow. So we run it as a single thing. We report it as a single thing. And that's what we'll continue to do.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Michael Carrier of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, guys. Hey, Scott, maybe first one. Just on the volume backdrop. Obviously, October's been strong. You didn't give any update on the expense side. But just wanted to get your sense if we're in this environment and this \u2013 maybe not the October levels, but we're in a better volume backdrop over the next few quarters and into 2019.","Like how should we be thinking about the incremental margin from the transaction part of the business? Just because it hasn't been the big driver of the growth. So I just wanted to get maybe an update on what it could mean for the margin.","Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","It's a great question. For a part of our business that even though it's half our revenue, people seem to forget about.","We've noted that over the last year, open interest has built and built and built and pointed people to \u2013 when volatility hits, volumes will be there. And directly to your question, why that's so powerful is because there is very little to no incremental expense that comes with that volume growth. And so the incremental margins are high.","And so our expectation, as you've seen historically, is that as we deliver volume growth over 30% in October and as that runs through the rest of the fourth quarter \u2013 noting that it's the typical holiday quarter, and so you'll see some seasonal slowdown \u2013 that tremendous volume growth, that's based on really continued open interest growth, delivers with it high incremental margins.","And so the expense growth that you'll see moving forward, as you said, we didn't update guidance because nothing really changed, other than we'll add $9 million to $10 million related to MERS, more than offset by $18 million to $20 million of revenue. But with regards to that Trading & Clearing business, as the volumes grow, the incremental margins are high, the overall margins will expand, and it really doesn't drive expense growth.","Operator","The next question will come from Chris Allen of Compass Point. Please go ahead.","Chris Allen - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC","Morning, guys. I just wanted to follow up on the fixed income side. Obviously, developing RFQ. You're looking to get bigger in the institutional side. Last quarter you gave us some color just in terms of the size of the executions done on BondPoint. Wondering if you can give us a follow-up on that? And then maybe speak to the impact on TMC as some of the largest wealth managers are now to trade the platform and any incremental impact they've had there?","Benjamin R. Jackson - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yeah, so similar to \u2013 thanks for the question, Chris. Similar to the response I gave to Rich, I think the thing everyone needs to think about is the combination of our analytics assets, our reference data, our pricing assets, our index and ETF expertise as well as these execution protocols that we have through these trading platforms.","And it's really the combination of these assets is where over time, as I'm updating you and I've been updating you on initiatives like the ETF hub and portfolio rebalancing, what's really bringing these institutional initiatives to life is the combination of all these assets that's enabling us to get there.","To your direct question around performance of the businesses, so I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we had high volume of 800,000 trades in Q3 alone. That's across TMC and BondPoint. If you can think about that as being up double digits. So we're pleased with the growth that we see in these platforms and also the expansion into the institutional space through some of these strategic initiatives.","Operator","The next question will come from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Scott, just wanted to clarify on the capital return. You guys have done a lot here in the first nine months. And I think your goal is $1.7 billion, I think you said for the year and you're already at $1.5 billion. So want to just \u2013 if that's an at least number and we can think about the opportunistic side of buyback and how we should think about capital return even into 2019 in terms of the priorities?","Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yeah, it's a good question. We've consistently been at the $1.7 billion for the year and that's where I think we'll land. As you'll recall in the second quarter, coming off of our earnings call, the stock was under a bit of pressure that we felt was completely unfounded and we did move opportunistically and accelerated some of the share repurchase. Our authorization for this year is $1.2 billion. We'll spend that. We'll likely exhaust it, middle of this quarter give or take. Share \u2013 our dividend will grow to above $500 million this year. So that's where you get to the $1.7 billion.","The nice thing about the new authorization of $2 billion is it shows \u2013 ours and, importantly, our board's continued view that our share price still seems to be disconnected a bit from true value. And so not only do we have the capability now over the next six quarters to grow our share repurchases, we have more flexibility if there are disconnects in the prices to move opportunistically. And so as we come into the February call, we'll give you an update specifically on the dividend which, as I said, we expect to grow again share repurchases, and exactly how much we would expect to spend during 2019. But I think the signal to you on the 2019 repurchase is we want to be positioned to continue to grow our cash returns, but also to be in a position to move in when the stock comes under unwarranted pressure.","Operator","The next question comes from Alex Kramm of UBS. Please go ahead.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Wanted to go back to MERS for a second. Thanks for the specifics there, Scott. But can you actually flush the revenue model out a little bit more for us going forward? I mean, I think if I'm correct, I think it's like $11, $12 per transaction kind of model today. So \u2013 but you're already capturing 75% of new originations. So is this basically the originations will go up? Or is there a different revenue model for backloading? And how could data fit in down the line? So basically, what should we be watching for as we try to model this business?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Alex, this is Jeff. It's a good question. So MERS right now, the way we think of it is a backbone that has unbelievable connectivity across the entire industry, and it's because of the legacy business that you mentioned, the legacy registration business that so many people have connected to MERS and use MERS, and if you buy a home or refinance now that you know the name MERS you'll look at your closing statement, you'll probably see that $10, $11, $12 charge on your closing statement for the basic registration.","What we're working with the industry is to now take that backbone and add to it other services that can really digitize the mortgage market. The mortgage market in the United States is still very paper-oriented. Even though you may, with certain providers, do an online mortgage application, what you don't realize is behind the scenes, ultimately those things get printed out on the paper and are dealt with in paper form. So we launched two new services; an eNote services so that the note part of the mortgage can be digitized and the note itself can be kept in digital form. And then in eVault where that note could be actually held by MERS.","Many of the large banks and mortgage providers have their own vaults and MERS would essentially have a pointer that would tell the market where the golden record is, even if it's not at MERS. But we've now launched an eVault service. What we've seen on eVault is an uptake by the small and mid-tier banks that are interested in a one-stop solution by MERS as they go digital. And increasingly, we're talking to them about how we could put these vaults inside our cyber layer, and inside our data centers and what have you, which have tremendous capabilities beyond the capacity of many, many small users.","So those new initiatives are the things when we talk about digitizing the mortgage space that we'll be talking to you about. Not necessarily the legacy business. The legacy business is a fantastic business that allowed us to buy a company that is already generating profits now that we have the new platform in place. But it's really the future growth of the electronification that we'll be talking to you about.","Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","And Alex, just to help a little bit with the model question. I think probably the best thing to do is to take the fourth quarter guidance and multiply by four to kind of think about that as the 2019 base. And then I think similar to Ben's comments on fixed income and Jeff's comments on ICE Mortgage Services, you look at that as the starting point with us building the strategy out through 2019 and then really generating growth into 2020, 2021, et cetera, which I think builds on our track record of investing today in new growth initiatives that will generate growth two, three, four years out.","Operator","The next question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for, I guess, all incremental data again on the NYSE data side of things. Scott, I think I heard you mention some choppiness in the NYSE session fees. Is it helpful to quantify, I guess, how much those are and whether or not that should impact in any sort of way your prior guide on market data? I think you guys had $538 million, $542 million for Q4?","Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yeah. As I mentioned, that's largely actually a dynamic around the rollout of our Pillar technology. And that Pillar technology will make us \u2013 it has made us far more efficient from an expense base. It makes our security and uptime far better, our trading capabilities far better. But as we've rolled old technology to new technologies, some customers have taken the opportunity to rationalize the number of sessions that they have. And so that hit the third quarter a little bit. As I mentioned, I think it will continue into the fourth quarter just a couple million bucks in the quarter. And so it puts a little bit of pressure on the numbers.","But overall, it's small in the scheme of things. It doesn't detract from the trends we've talked about, particularly the trends in pricing analytics which are very strong and accelerating and our futures exchange data, which was solid in the quarter. And our feeds business which I noted grew double digits. So the reality is our data business has a number of moving pieces. That's one of them that was a bit soft in the quarter and will be again in the fourth quarter. But I think the overall engine in the data services business is clicking pretty well.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","And maybe just another backdrop that I think all of you on the call that follow this financial services space are aware of, but just to state the obvious, there's been a consolidation in the exchange business by the large public company exchange operators. There's also been a consolidation in the market-making business. There's been a consolidation going on in the brokerage business where the large brokers have increased market share. There's been a consolidation going on in the ETF management business.","Our financial services space in a digital world is consolidating and lowering overall transaction cost by putting scale against these digital systems. And you see it all across our industry. And ultimately, it's really massively lowered the cost of transacting business which is why we can say that the United States is the cheapest place to manage capital raising and equities in the world.","Operator","The next question will come from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks very much. Maybe just to finish up the look at market data into the fourth quarter. The $538 million to $542 million. Thanks for the comments on the connectivity desktop side. Maybe if you can also talk about the contribution of the stronger futures data to the exchange data line within data as we move into 4Q. Clearly, the pricing analytics is also growing or accelerating, as you said, Scott. So as we look into 4Q, I guess should we expect a potential acceleration into that $538 million and $542 million with some potential upside given those trends or is the Pillar headwinds enough of a sort of a headwind to keep you in the bottom of that range? And then also, just any audits of collection data feeds in the exchange data bucket this quarter?","Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yeah, look, audits are part of every quarter, frankly. And we've pointed it out when it's caused a particularly outsized impact on any given quarter. The fact that we didn't point to anything in the quarter doesn't suggest that there weren't any. It simply suggests that there weren't any that were unusually large as a kind of, if you will, a part of the run rate business. Look, I think overall \u2013 and I'm not going to focus just on the fourth quarter because we run the business over the longer term. I think what you should expect is to continue to see the data services business continue to accelerate quarter to quarter to quarter.","And you see it in the absolute terms. You see it in growth terms. I mean you see it in the Pricing and Analytics business that has consistently grown. And as I noted, ASV for Pricing and Analytics is up 8% overall. Overall ASV is up between 6% and 7% ending the third quarter, entering the fourth quarter as well. So I think we've got strength across all of the businesses. You asked specifically about exchange data, good third quarter. The reality is that the futures exchange data we tend to get a little bit more out of the exchange data when the volume size is a bit little softer on some of our minimum commission fees. I don't expect that will continue into the fourth quarter because our volumes are great.","And so it's interesting because it's a revenue dollar that doesn't go away. It's a revenue dollar that maybe doesn't show up in data, and does show up in trading. And from where I sit, it's the total revenue dollar that drops down to the total earnings which matters. And that's where we consistently deliver. So I wouldn't get too hung up on any single number in a given quarter. I'd look at the track record of growth every quarter in terms of revenue and earnings, consistent acceleration in the data business, great volume growth in the trading business. And I think an underappreciated contribution from the NYSE that we showed on slide 7 across the board.","Operator","The next question will come from Jeremy Campbell of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Campbell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Thank you. Ben, I know you guys said that the response has been positive so far, but with the ETF hub, is this more of a, if you build it, they will come type platform. Or is there any sort of heavy-lifting on your end with some hurdles to clear to kind of ramp adoption there? And then in growing the institutional bond trading activity, do we see most of that early upside stemming from this ETF hub or is there some extra white space out there that some of our larger competitors maybe falling short on?","Benjamin R. Jackson - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Great question. Thank you, Jeremy. So, remember, when we announced this initiative on the ETF hub, we didn't do it in isolation. We were actually brought into it from one of the leading issuers in BlackRock. And really got the product off the ground and thinking about the requirements of what's going to need to be built. A lot of it's leveraging expertise that they have to \u2013 that they want to see us be successful in this market.","The other thing that well positioned us to do this and made it unique for us to be their partner, and why I believe they came to us to do this, is the combination of the analytical assets, the data assets that we've mentioned several times, our instant messaging platform that we have to handle the unique negotiations that happen in that create-redeem process, our ETF and index expertise and our execution capabilities, and willingness as a newcomer to the space to really help build an open architecture industry utility that would be embraced by the industry.","And as we have gone out this past quarter with BlackRock to meet with all of the other main issuers, the other authorized participants that are in this marketplace, the banks and market-makers, the response has been overwhelmingly positive.","We formed the advisory committee that's going to be guiding the requirements, and we're finalizing that as we speak. And as we finalize that, we're going to be finalizing our launch plan in 2019.","So in sum, we're filling a void where nobody is really acting in a market that's growing at a 30% compounded annual growth rate. But underpinning it, it has no standards, no consistency of process, disconnected systems, prone to error. And really needs someone to step in and fill that void.","Operator","The next question will come from Ben Herbert of Citi. Please go ahead.","Ben Herbert - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just a follow-up, Scott, to Mike's question on just a more constructive volume backdrop if that persists kind of into 2019. Just are there any perhaps areas you might be looking to ramp up investment against that? Thanks.","Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yeah, look, I think as you're starting to think about 2019 expense, yeah, I'd point you back to the last couple years and I don't think the framework looks a lot different.","We've got $30 million of synergies that we've committed to go, we'll deliver that. Our employees have delivered another good year. We've historically had 3% to 4% merit and bonus increases. We'll do that. D&A has tended to tick up $20 million a year or so as we roll through our CapEx spend and build out our IDC \u2013 or our ICE Data Services, data center plan and roll out Pillar.","And then we've identified certain specific investments we've made in support of current revenue and future revenue. And I think that framework holds as we move into 2019. We'll obviously give you more specifics as we move into the February call.","But I wouldn't go into 2019 looking for expense to really look that different than it did coming into 2017 and then moving into 2018. We did note coming into 2018 that we were going to reinvest some of the tax savings, which we're doing. And so I wouldn't expect the investment level necessarily to be at a similar level. But the other dynamic I think are pretty consistent and will remain.","Directly to your question, none of that is driven by trading volumes. And so to the extent that that continues to trend as it has and certainly open interest is an indicator that it will, but volatility is a key metric that will determine the extent, that that requires no additional expense and will expand margins and does drop to the bottom line and will inform our decisions with regards to our capital return plans with shareholders.","So overall expense for 2019, the model's going to look very similar directly to Trading & Clearing revenue. That growth is built on open interest and requires very little incremental spend.","Operator","The next question will come from Kyle Voigt of KBW. Please go ahead.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to ask a question on the regulatory environment and really relate it to the third-country CCP amendments by the European Commission that were proposed last year.","I think, Chairman [Christopher] Giancarlo has been a lot more vocal about the potential impacts of those on U.S. clearing houses and has kind of threatened to respond to that EU proposal. Just wondering how you're thinking about potential risk to your business from all this jockeying between the EU, UK and U.S., given that you're kind of uniquely positioned in all the jurisdictions involved. And what you think the likely resolution will be moving forward. Thanks.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Thank you. That's a good question, one that spends a pretty significant amount of time and has for the last couple years with the management team here.","Really the way we're thinking about it is, is a bit like the way you framed your question, which is, we don't exactly know how it's going to end up. So we feel like, and have for years felt like, we need to have assets in various jurisdictions. And we need to hone our technology and our skills and our capabilities so that we could theoretically move and follow markets if they move between those jurisdictions.","And we have a large presence in the UK, as you may know. And the UK may become a third country to the EU, in which case there'll be some kind of third country CCP regime. It may have some kind of interim fix for how that's going to work. It may not, in which case the U.S. may have a third-country CCP regime into Europe. Obviously, businesses in Europe will be able to access Europe. But then the question is, can outsiders that are not in Europe access European CCP. So all of that is in the mix right now.","I think recent conversation coming out of Europe and the UK is that there's a recognition that a hard Brexit that failed to deal with an interim solution would be bad for all the people involved. And so we've seen a lot of constructive conversation in the background about how to overcome these things, working within current law and the negotiations that are going on between the various parties.","Long story short, I think Europe has basically said, we want to oversee our financial services infrastructure. And the U.S. has said, we want to oversee our financial services infrastructure. Those are rational positions that each government has taken.","And so they're going to have to find the gray area in the middle on how they work together for the international players that are in both places. But honestly, I do see that happening notwithstanding the rhetoric. There's an appreciation that many markets are global and that everybody's going to need access in order to hedge risks. And that's in the best interest of local economies. So I'm sitting here being honestly more optimistic than I have been for the last few years.","Operator","The next question will come from Vincent Hung of Autonomous. Please go ahead.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Hi. So it seemed like at the roundtable, there's a lot of maybe some consensus around making enhancements to the SIP through the additions of flood data, (53:54) speed improvements and also perhaps opening up the SIP to competitors. So let's say, this happened. How much of a negative could that be for your SIP revenues? Or could there be offsets from charging for the prop data driving those feeds?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Well, it's hard to know how to answer that. But you may recall that when we bought the NYSE, we tried to put out a straw-man proposal that we hope the industry would adopt that maybe everybody uses the SIP and there is no prop feed. Or maybe we get rid of the SIP and everybody uses prop feeds or so on and so forth. So we have long had the mindset that change in that area will not hurt us. It may benefit us and certainly get rid of some of the rhetoric. I've been amazed to see in the press there's still a perception that there's somehow a two-tier market of speed and access that I don't believe even exists any longer. We go to extraordinary lengths to look at delivering messages equally to all participants including SIP and as do most of our peers so that there is no distinction.","And of course, the markets should continue to invest in the SIP, the volumes, transaction volumes and changes going into the market would suggest that we need constant upgrade. And the total spend to operate the SIP is in the scheme of things, quite tiny. So it's \u2013 I don't think there's going to be a large debate over whether there should be continued investment. But the debate seems to be about who should sit in the room and who should get a vote and who should be the vendor and it's all small ball issues that in the scheme of things probably don't impact anybody in the market as long as we can all agree to continue to make it better.","Operator","The next question will come from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, guys. Jeff, appreciate all your comments on equity market structure this morning. I know in the past you've tried reaching a grand bargain with the banks on an unrelated matter. Unfortunately, that was unsuccessful. But with respect to these market data challenges, is there an opportunity, do you think, for the industry to come together and perhaps make a compromise on the fees? Or do you think at this point the two sides are just too far apart?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","It's a great question. We proffered as part of the access fee pilot that why don't we freeze data revenues and why don't we come up with a better pilot that doesn't negatively impact listed companies but gets to the heart of where the argument by the large players which are the large banks by the large data providers and by the exchanges? Really this is a Range Rover versus BMW versus Mercedes argument. And we propose that the fee freeze on the industry for data. The interesting thing is that a lot of people now as a result of the SEC's actions think, oh, that's not a good deal. Maybe fees should go down. And even though it looked to us like the SEC went to great pains to suggest that they're not saying that fees should go higher or fees should go lower as part of their action, they didn't make any qualitative statement like that.","What I think the market has missed and what I think may be realized over time in this debate is that these hundreds of filings that were made were not hundreds of fee increases. These are filings made over a decade. When we went from largely analog to digital and when we went from a market where there was no such thing as an ETF to a robust market of ETFs. When there was no such thing as a smart order router to everyone using smart order routers, when there was no such thing as a Robo-advisor to a massive uses of Robo-advisors. All of those things are different products and services and changes and bundles. And in many cases, they're fee decreases or getting rid of products and so on and so forth. So it's a big mixed bag of filings that are in there.","The way those filings work, the way we've seen them work since ICE has owned the New York Stock Exchange is that there's not a big rubberstamp inside the SEC. We put filings in, in draft form and have a lot of conversation with staff around many of these filings. And staff often says we think the price is too high, or we don't like the bundle, or we don't like the way it's worded, or we don't like the access provisions and so on and so forth. And there's a large negotiation that goes on, on many of these with staff, and in many cases these filings are withdrawn, and they go away, or in many cases they're modified and they go forward. And what has happened I believe as a result of this order, the SEC has now said when you do a filing, if you're an exchange, show up with an army. Show up with an army of consultants, of economists and lawyers. And of course, from now on we're going to show up with an army of litigators. And I don't know if you guys have ever \u2013 that have been listening to me have ever been in a situation where you have a bunch of litigators that are advising you and so the quiet conversation of drafting and going back and forth with staff is going to be a very different dynamic from here forward because everything's going to be documented and footnoted and written down. And I'm not sure that prices go down in that situation.","It may well be that exchanges that wanted to raise prices in the past, and had staff interfaced that said that that wasn't a good idea. That may be gone in this new environment at least for the next few years. And so I'm not convinced that this is some massive downward pressure on fees. It may actually have taken the downward pressure on fees away. And when the industry \u2013 if I'm right in that and the industry realizes that, I think there is a good environment for a negotiation. But right now, it feels like a lot of the big players think, oh, I'm going to use my lobbying effort at the SEC to reduce my prices, and I'm not convinced that that's what's going to happen as part of this policy.","Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yeah. I think an important point not to lose sight of too is, Jeff keeps talking about the overall quality of the markets, the participation in the markets, the cost to trade in the market. And that's more than just data. It's data, it's trading, it's all of the pieces. And so, again it's why I go back, if you look at half our data business is pricing and analytics and the revenue model we delivered, new products, new customers, existing customers. It all drives pricing and analytic 100%. For exchange data connectivity, the other half of that data revenue, it works intricately with the trading side of it. And really whether it's fewer session fees, but higher trading share or a little less on the data side, and a little more on the trading side, every one of those is a revenue dollar we'll take. And that's why I wouldn't get too hung up on which bucket it falls into. It's our revenues growing overall, it's earnings growing overall and are we providing better markets to our customers?","Operator","And this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Sprecher for any closing remarks.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Thank you, Carrie, and thank you all for joining us today.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.","Now I would like to turn the conference over to Kelly Loeffler. Please go ahead.","Kelly L. Loeffler","Good morning. ICE's first quarter 2014 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investor section of our website at theice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the company's Form 10-K. Please note, that in addition to the GAAP results presented today, we've also referred to our adjusted operating results. These measures adjust our GAAP results for various extraordinary items, including our acquisition of NYSE Euronext, and we believe are more reflective of our core business performance than our GAAP results. You'll find a non-GAAP reconciliation and earnings release and presentation and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful, as well as how management uses these measures. Net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses. With us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Chuck Vice, President and Chief Operating Officer.","I'll now turn the call over to Scott.","Scott A. Hill","Thank you, Kelly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4, where we highlight our record results and the significant progress we've made during the quarter. Consolidated net revenues totaled $932 million, including strong contributions across our transaction, clearing and data businesses. We believe that performance demonstrates the value of the diversification of our global products and market, particularly in light of the muted volumes in certain energy and interest rate markets. We continue to focus on disciplined expense management and have now achieved over $220 million in synergies, double where we were in the fourth quarter, and well on track to the achievement of our stated objectives. And as a result of our strong revenue and expense performance, we delivered double-digit earnings growth with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.60, up 28%.","Due to the first 4 months of 2014, we continue to make good progress on our integration and restructuring plans, including the planned IPO of Euronext and NYXT divestitures, along with the integration of Liffe in ICE Futures Europe. Even as we work on reorganizing and integrating NYSE Euronext, we remain focused on establishing new opportunities for future growth. We continue to expand our product offerings during the first quarter. And in February, we completed the acquisition of the Singapore Mercantile Exchange and clearing house, which we renamed to ICE Futures Singapore and ICE Clear Singapore. As you can see, it's been a busy and productive start to 2014.","Please now turn to Slide 5, where I'll detail our first quarter results. Consolidated net revenues of $932 million benefited from strength across our agricultural, emissions and refined oil products, U.S. equity options, Euronext cash trading and CDS clearing. This revenue performance reflects growth of 1% compared to pro forma first quarter 2013 results. Further adjusting the prior year pro forma results to reflect the businesses now being recorded as discontinued operations, we've yielded revenue growth of 4% year-over-year. Adjusted operating expenses were $463 million and our consolidated adjusted operating margin was 50%. This is a notable improvement from the 45% pro forma operating margin we showed you on our November 19 strategic and financial update call. Adjusted operating expenses actually came in better than our guidance due to a number of one-off benefits, which were partially offset by negative currency impacts in the other expense line.","Our first quarter expenses, excluding the one-off benefits would have landed in the lower end of our guidance range and operating margins still would've been a solid 49%. Our tax rate for the first quarter was 28%.","Adjusted net income attributable to ICE grew 14% on a pro forma basis to $301 million, and adjusted EPS were $2.60 per share. And importantly, operating cash flows were $519 million, which is up 16% versus the combined operating cash flows of the 2 companies in the first quarter of 2013.","And while you can't extrapolate first quarter cash flows to the full year due to annual liftings, billings and bonus payments, the first quarter results clearly demonstrate our ability to generate strong cash flow. This cash generation will enable us to delever, repurchase shares and continue to invest in future growth, including investments in operational capital expenditures and capitalized software, which were $49 million in the quarter.","Let's move to Slide 6, where we detailed revenues and expenses for the ICE segment. On the left side of the chart, you can see that ICE segment revenues were $796 million, with nearly $500 million coming from net transaction and clearing revenues.","Market data revenues were $103 million, including record revenue from ICE data. NYSE listings generated $82 million in revenue, and other revenue contributed $114 million in the first quarter.","On the right side of the chart, you can see ICE segment expenses. First quarter adjusted expenses were $382 million and adjusted operating margin was 52%. As I mentioned previously, we had roughly $8 million in one-off noncash compensation and tax accrual benefits in the first quarter. Even adjusting for those benefits, and including an anticipated increase in our second quarter performance, base compensation due to the timing of grants in 2014, the ICE operating margin still would've been around 51%.","Now let's turn to Slide 7, where I'll discuss the Euronext segment, which delivered a strong start to 2014. Net revenues for the first quarter were $136 million, or 44% from cash trading, 22% from market data and 13% from derivatives trading. This performance was driven by solid volume growth and cash equity, where ADV increased 16% year-over-year and was amplified by a 7% increase in revenue capture versus the prior quarter. While Euronext's derivatives volume decreased slightly, revenue capture actually increased. Euronext's operating margin was 41% and net income was $36 million for the first quarter of 2014. And importantly, these strong financial metrics do not yet reflect either the clearing economics Euronext began earning in April or the EUR 60 million in cost synergies the Euronext management team expects to deliver over the next 3 years.","As a leading pan-European equities and derivatives platform in Europe, Euronext is led by a strong management team, produces strong cash flows and has low capital requirements. We continue to see a gradual improvement of the European economy and anticipate that this will enable Euronext to build upon the solid performance we saw in the first quarter.","Moving on to Slide 8. I'll discuss our derivatives revenue in volumes in greater detail. Total futures and options revenue, including net revenue for U.S. equity options for the first quarter was $357 million. Notably, while volume trends were soft across energy and financials, we delivered revenue growth year-to-year in our derivatives business as a result of the addition of clearing for interest rates, a favorable mix in energy and interest rate contracts and solid revenue growth in our agricultural products.","Daily volumes for futures and options in the quarter were 6.6 million contracts, a decrease of 13% year-to-year. However, daily volumes across ag and emission contracts were both up double digits year-to-year. Our ag revenues in the first quarter were $54 million, up 25% over last year's first quarter, due mainly to weather affecting crops in Brazil and price volatility across sugar, cocoa and coffee. The volume strength in ag and emissions was offset by decreases in volume, driven by low levels of volatility in our Brent gas oil and North American natural gas market. However, despite the volume declines in natural gas, thanks to the strong performance in our European natural gas market, overall net gas revenues actually increased slightly versus the prior year. And while the ICE gas oil futures contract volumes continue to be impacted by the transition to the low sulfur contract specification, the transition will be completed at the end of May, which should help volumes return to more normalized levels.","Interest rate futures volumes declined in the first quarter as absolute rates remained low, particularly in Euribor. Despite lower overall volume, interest rate contributed $80 million in revenue in the quarter, which includes clearing revenues that were not included in last year's first quarter due to third party clearing arrangements.","Before leaving this slide, I want to note that although we have seen softer volumes in some of our benchmark energy contracts, open interest trends remained healthy. As we close the first quarter, we saw record open interest across many of our benchmark contracts, including Brent and ag, which were up 16% and 14%, respectively, in the end of 2013. And as we've seen before, once volatility and seasonal activity returns, healthy open interest levels generally translate into volume growth.","Next, on Slide 9, I'll update you on our CDS business. We reported CDS revenues of $43 million in the first quarter, driven by record clearing revenues of $26 million, which were up 64% compared to the prior first quarter. We believe that market participants see the value of clearing CDS on the ICE clearing platform due to the investments we've made, which ensure that we have the most comprehensive global offering and risk framework.","In March, we launched clearing for Markit iTraxx Senior Financial CDS index instrument. And 2 weeks ago, ICE Clear Europe began clearing Western European sovereign CDS.","Moving on to Slide 10. I'll talk about our strong cash generation and capital management. We closed the quarter with over $1 billion in unrestricted cash and short-term investments and we generated operating cash flow of $519 million, up 16% from the prior year. We expect to continue to generate strong cash flows from operations, as well as from the Euronext IPO and the divestiture of certain NYSE Technology's businesses. We intend to use this cash flow to delever to our adjusted debt to EBITDA target of 1.5x, continue investing for growth, and resume our share buyback program.","We remain focused on delivering returns on investments that are above our cost of capital and better than our peers. And we declared our intention to pay a $0.65 per share dividend, again, in the second quarter.","Finally, during the quarter, we worked to further optimize our debt structure. On April 3, we entered into a new 5-year $3 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and used our commercial paper to pay down our $367 million term loan. For the balance of 2014, we expect quarterly interest expense in the range of $24 million to $25 million, which is lower than our prior guidance.","Let's move to Slide 11, where we've highlighted a few items to clarify financial reporting questions. I won't walk through the entire slide, but will touch briefly on the ICE segment of the revenue, which was $114 million in the first quarter. There are several revenue streams that comprise this line item, such as technology services, trading license fees and regulatory listed company service fees, among others. As part of the integration process, we have now moved the Liffe clearing fees out of other revenues and into transaction and clearing revenues for the first quarter. Previously, Liffe clearing revenues were reported in the other revenue lines rather than transaction and clearing revenue. As you would expect, this resulted in our reported first quarter RPC being understated for ags, metals and financials. Therefore, on this slide, we updated RPC to include clearing. This is also reflected in our April volume release and has no impact to total revenues.","I'll conclude my remarks on Slide 12 with an update to our current guidance. Please note that our guidance includes Euronext and excludes nonstrategic NYSE technologies businesses that are reported in discontinued operations.","For the second quarter 2014, we expect that other revenues will be in the range of $120 million to $130 million. Adjusted consolidated operating expenses for the second quarter are expected to be between $485 million to $495 million. The increase in second quarter expense guidance versus that provided in the first quarter is due to roughly $15 million in additional expenses in the Euronext business. This is primarily driven by $3 million to $4 million related to investments required to operate Euronext on a standalone basis and $9 million to $10 million, related to Euronext's new derivatives clearing arrangement, which began on April 1.","Notably, that clearing arrangement is also expected to generate $16 million to $17 million of incremental revenue in the second quarter, assuming volumes are similar to the first quarter. For the ICE segment, adjusted for the one-off items noted previously, we expect adjusted operating expenses to be relatively stable and in the range of $390 million to $400 million for the second quarter. And for the full year 2014, we expect adjusted operating expenses of $1.56 billion to $1.58 billion.","Importantly, we are on course to achieve 70% of our synergies or $350 million as we exit 2014. For the second quarter of 2014, we expect capital expenditures and capitalized software of $60 million to $65 million. And for the year, we will invest $200 million to $210 million, excluding real estate expenditures. This figure is higher than our previous CapEx guidance due to investments to standardize and increase the efficiency of our technology platform at the NYSE.","D&A expense for 2014 is expected to be between $360 million and $370 million, including $85 million to $90 million in the second quarter. Finally, we continue to expect an effective tax rate of between 27% and 30%.","We are well into the second quarter and are continuing to respond to our customers\u2019 needs through product innovation, risk management and compliance solutions. We're executing on our strategic initiatives and are well positioned to continue to grow our revenues, achieve double-digit earnings growth and generate strong cash flows and value for our shareholders.","I'll be happy to take your questions during our Q&A session. Jeff, over to you.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Thank you, Scott. That was a lot to digest. Today, I'd like to cover our energy and interest rate futures business, provide some thoughts on U.S. equity market structure and discuss the progress that we've made on integrating NYSE Euronext.","Over the long term, trading and risk management activities continue to move on exchange and into clearing houses. While this trend was already underway and we began clearing energy swaps in 2002, it was only accelerated with the implementation of Dodd-Frank. With the near implementation taking place in Europe over the next year, the trend towards clearing is also playing out there.","We're focused on meeting regulatory requirements and the demand for new products and capital efficiency. We're expanding our reach globally, most recently into Asia, to address the demand for market infrastructure. We believe that Asia will also implement financial reforms focused on enhancing risk management and supporting the development of regulated clearing houses. Ships in the global economy are driving demand, as the pan-Asian region moves to becoming the largest global consumer of commodities.","With economic and regulatory change reshaping markets around the world, our geographic and product diversity across commodity and financial products, and our ability to evolve as markets change, position us very well for the long term.","You can see the breadth of our energy markets on Slide 13, including the expansion activity through economic cycles and through regulatory change. Since the beginning of the financial crisis in 2008, our energy revenues have grown at a compound rate of 13% annually. And this is consistent with ICE futures Europe's 17 consecutive years of record volume.","On the slide, you can see the strong base of revenue across the diversified mix of energy products, which are relied upon each day by global energy companies and consumers. While financial reform has had the effect of pushing some banks to exit their physical commodities operation, we continue to see a strong role for banks as they facilitate customer business in these markets. And consistent with our focus on commercial end-users, you can see in our Commitment of Trader reports that well over half of our open interest in energy is from commercial market participants.","Moving forward to Slide 14, we've highlighted some of the trends underlying our global oil business. Brent crude volumes were softer in Q1 due to multiyear lows and price volatility with prices locked in a tight range. In addition, the former pricing curve for Brent was in contango for the first quarter, while the WTI market stayed in backwardation. Nevertheless, open interest grew at a healthy clip and stands at record levels, as you can see with the green light on the left.","On the right side, you can see the over 80% compound annual growth rate and our suite of refined oil products. This demonstrates how the benchmark Brent contract has attracted customers who now trade a full range of refined oil products. Today, our oil contracts number over 400.","In the second quarter, we expect to launch 64 new energy contracts, over 20 of which are oil products. I'll also point out, the contracts represented by the blue bars on the same chart, represent products where our market share has grown from 0 to over 13% in just a few years\u2019 time. This represents meaningful capital efficiencies at the clearing level.","Moving to Slide 15. You can see the trends on our global natural gas markets. While North American natural gas volumes have declined year-to-year during the past several quarters, average daily volume for the first quarter was 25% above the first quarter of 2010, and open interest has doubled and remained significantly above precrisis levels. This demonstrates solid growth in the user base and in demand for hedging. And while U.S. natural gas prices lack volatility in the last months, this is a solid business due to the increasingly important role that natural gas holds, both in North America and around the world.","On the right side of the slide, you can see the robust growth in our natural gas contracts traded on ICE Futures Europe, particularly following our acquisition and subsequent launch of the ICE Endex business last year. Through ICE Endex, we now list the primary European gas benchmarks, and the efficiencies of this model are driving growth. I've long spoken about our view of the increasing globalization of natural gas products. And this quarter, you can see this trend in our results. As a result of the solid performance in the non-U.S. natural gas markets, ICE's total natural gas revenues actually increased 1% during the quarter, where European volume growth of 64% offset the double-digit decline in our North American volume.","Turning to interest rates on the next few charts, starting on Slide 16. You can see the underlying trends in our Liffe interest rates complex. First, daily volumes have returned, and in some cases, exceeded precrisis levels. And this is despite a low interest rate environment impacting our benchmark short-term contract, the Euribor future.","However, open interest across our European interest rate futures complex is up 21% from the start of this year.","On Slide 17, you can see one of the primary drivers within the Liffe rates complex is the sterling futures contract, where daily volumes grew 30% in the first quarter and open interest over 80% from year end. This contract is a proxy for U.K. economic sentiment and expectations for the Bank of England's actions on interest rates. With economic indicators improving, the short sterling contract has been active.","On Slide 18, you can see the diversity of our growing interest rate complex. Growth in our Gilt futures volumes reflect the rising demand for rate hedging, further out the yield curve, where we've grown volume and over -- interest over 2 years.","Volume in the swap note contract, which was the first launched futures swap to futures interest rate product. And now in its 13th year, was up 32% over last year's first quarter, with open interest increasing double digits over the same period.","Last month, we introduced the Ultra Long Gilt Futures contract, which has attracted solid volume growth and open interest since our launch. These products are not only performing well, but they'll be joined by 21 new European interest rate contracts that we're introducing this quarter.","So you can see that we're very engaged in building out a leading European rates platform. In addition, our team is working to ensure a smooth transition of the Liffe market to the ICE futures platform by year end. We believe that this investment will create operational and capital efficiencies that will drive value for customers and for shareholders.","Moving now to Slide 19. I want to note the strength of our listings business for 2 reasons: first, because The New York Stock Exchange continues to lead in the amount of capital raised, as well as in technology IPOs, as we move to the halfway point of 2014. But more importantly, I want to talk about the importance of a healthy market for our issuers. It's vital that we continue to attract companies to the public markets, because they trust the fairness and stability of these markets. The pie will grow for all if investor confidence in markets is strong. The U.S. capital markets are the deepest, most liquid markets in the world for capital raising. And they're a key source of competitiveness of our economy globally. Access to public capital fuels innovation and creates jobs for economies around the world. Issuers and investors need confidence that the markets are transparent and that they are fair. It's that trust and confidence that keeps the flywheel of capital flowing.","In this regard, let me address a few ideas around how we can improve the structure in our equity market. For the past year, I've suggested that this market could be simplified and that the pendulum has swung too far on complexity. While a year ago, my comments were not widely supported within our industry, the current conversation has led to increasing support and an opportunity to dialogue in earnest on the important issues facing this industry.","You can see on Slide 20, many of the developments that ICE brought to improve confidence in the commodity and derivative markets that we serve. It's important to note that this progress is a result of the extensive work with our customers and our regulators. And as we bring our experience into derivatives, we'll continue to work closely with customers and regulators to drive positive change in the equity markets that we serve. Many parties share responsibility for today's market model, including incumbent exchanges like The New York Stock Exchange. Most importantly, we, in the industry, must provide the leadership to respond to needed change. And we're encouraged by the SEC's work and recent comments acknowledging the need to address market complexity. Years ago, the market's reaction to a perceived lack of transparency and fairness was to create competition at the exchange level. Ultimately, this went further than most could have anticipated. And this has led to extreme fragmentation, with over 50 venues to trade the same lifted securities. While a national market system linking these venues together is a worthy goal, it has resulted in an overly complex structure with many unintended consequences. Historically, markets naturally formed up in a single venue to establish liquidity and the best price discovery. Today's fragmentation of such standardized markets is unnatural for the ultimate end-user and it tends to be promoted by those who seek to benefit from assets to better information. With extreme fragmentation, buyers and sellers have no choice but to seek to form a single price discovery stream by employing smart order routers, algorithms and high-frequency strategies. And to maintain liquidity, you've seen the convergence of market makers and high-frequency trading firms with very little means to distinguish meritorious activity from that, which can be disruptive.","What I believe is being launched in the evolution of the equity market is that the essential form of competition that we should be improving is that between the buyers and sellers of securities, both of whom are seeking to discover the best price for themselves. This means that the concept of competition should not be focused exclusively on creating more exchange venues, whose propagation continues with no end in sight. There seems to be no justification, now that studies are showing that pricing benefits are being reversed, and where the public price discovery function for end-users is being weakened.","It's certainly a positive fact that technology and automation has tightened bid offer spreads, but the fragmentation and instability of the market today has also increased its risk and complexity. In a Monday article in USA Today, it comments, \"This week marks the fourth anniversary of the brutal flash crash that rocketed markets on May 6, 2010, and is a stark reminder of how little has changed.\" Our market structure might have created a better pie with lower exchange fees and tighter spreads, but it is a shrinking pie that fewer want to consume. Americans are seeking other investments, instead of providing the fuel to our listed companies.","It's also a positive fact that technology and competition in the U.S. equity markets has dramatically reduced exchange fees and improved access. For example, a retail customer buying 100 shares of stock may pay $9.95 to an online broker, not $800 as in times past.","Today, if that trade was routed to a U.S. regulated exchange, the revenue capture would average about $0.02. In other words, an amount that is insignificant to that total transaction. Only about $0.02 would go to an exchange on a $10 broker commission. Similarly, a large institutional fund manager buying 100 shares of stock today would pay their broker something like $1. The U.S. exchange capture is yet again about $0.02, similarly insignificant to this transaction; and so low, that it should not justify the existence of off exchange trading as a need to avoid excessive exchange fees, particularly where there's an absence of meaningful price or size improvement. And by definition, the avoidance of transacting on a regulated exchange is also the avoidance of regulatory oversight and the removal of price signals that contribute to the public price formation process. We've advocated for the regulatory elimination of maker-taker fees coupled with the reduction and equalization of access fees in the U.S. equity markets. This would expose the low exchange capture fees that I just mentioned, directly to all market participants. Maker-taker fees also create incentives for intermediaries to potentially place their own interest ahead of the obligation to customers. And I believe the vast majority of brokers are honest actors who want to place their customer's interests first, but they're being put in an increasingly untenable position with regard to best execution requirements.","And in order to protect market participants for regulatory breaches and while availing themselves of maker-taker rebates, execution venues have further complicated markets by creating order types that play into maker-taker capture, such as the well-named \"Hide don't slide,\" among others. The imbalance in maker-taker fees creates fee arbitrageurs that add to market volume, while simply trying to buy on one exchange and sell on another in risk-free trades, while not actually wanting to own stocks. Encouraging transient liquidity signals is potentially as risky as encouraging transient price signals. Because traders not only rely on price information, they also rely on volume information when making trading decisions.","The SEC has already placed limits on exchange fees. And thus, we believe that these limits could be updated to eliminate maker-taker pricing, while equalizing exchange access fees at lower levels for all investors.","The New York Stock Exchange had a significant opportunity to offer solutions that rebuild confidence and protect shareholder value. And we believe that we can start by unilaterally reducing the excessive complexity that exists today, such as the proliferation of order types. Therefore, the first step towards making our markets less complex, we will voluntarily reduce the number of order types at our U.S. equity exchanges. We've identified over 1 dozen existing order types that we plan to apply to the SEC for rule changes to eliminate.","And beyond that, we will continue to evaluate our other order types to identify those that may not be providing the market with true utility. Too many of these order types were developed in an attempt to replicate dark pool trading or to segment the market to try to attract one type of investor over another type of investor.","The SEC has recently completed a comprehensive audit of order types, and we believe that exchanges and dark pools should adopt a moratorium on creating any new types of orders.","We had a spirited internal debate on whether we should unilaterally begin eliminating order types, and certainly, there were some who did not initially like this idea. You see, we have 1\/2 a dozen-or-so more new order types that are in the works, and some of them have already been built into our matching engines and are ready to launch. These new order types are smart, they're innovative, and some may really put the hurt on our competition.","However, I suspect that they will further fragment the U.S. equities market, which will ultimately hurt investors. My colleagues worry that our competition won't share our end user concerns and they'll continue to develop products that'll further fragment the market. If this is so, I reminded them that maybe we should be paying our competitors salaries because I believe they're setting themselves up for long-term failures.","Today, the average order size on the 5 largest alternative trading venues has fallen to a little more than 200 shares, an amount that is near or, in some cases, below the size of regulated market order fills.","As smart order routers are now slicing up orders into small digestible bites, today, there is very little difference between retail order fills and large institutional order fills, increasingly obsoleting the need for trading venues to segment our customers or segment their trading behaviors by offering differing order types or by even having different regulatory oversight.","In light of a number of articles that I've recently seen, I want to also spend a moment to describe our market data offerings. Our U.S. equity exchanges produce and sell raw data feeds, which include every single quote and cancellation that is submitted to the matching engine.","Pursuant to an agreement we have with the SEC, we make sure that our raw data feeds are not made available to customers any sooner than the data is made available to the national securities information processors, also known as SIPs. So in other words, it's a rule that everyone receive raw -- the raw data feed at the same time, including the SIPs.","Now the major broker-dealers are co-located in our facilities and receive raw data feeds at the same time as latency-sensitive traders. And unlike other regulated markets where ICE operates that allow for direct access, broker-dealers are the sole access point for customer trade execution on U.S. equity exchanges.","UNI's [ph] investors do not choose where our trades are routed to, and we're not allowed to access U.S. equity exchanges directly. Therefore, as long as a co-located broker-dealer's interests are aligned with its customers' interests, retail and institutional customers of major broker-dealers should see no speed advantage and no speed disadvantage in these markets.","Now some had called for us to further slow down the raw data feeds to match the output of the SIPs, but this would likely have exactly the opposite impact that its proponents are trying to achieve.","Recall that traders currently receive their trade confirmations from matching engines at their native speeds, and active traders who are constantly buying and selling small numbers of shares, see stocks move through various price levels by employing this trading strategy.","If the raw data were delayed to match the output of the SIP, this would give active traders significantly earlier knowledge of stock movements, well before the public, as a result of their active trade confirmations. This time advantage would be big enough to drive a truck through. That's why simply slowing down the raw data feed would only create more problems.","However, we do believe that there are a number of solutions that could be enacted to better ensure parity, so long as they were adopted by the entire industry. We could slow the raw data feeds or combine the raw data and the SIPs into single feeds or use technology to further speed up the SIPs. But all that would have to be done while simultaneously slowing trade confirmations, including those from dark pool matching engines to eliminate all trade data information advantages.","But again, such speed equivalence changes would need to be universally adopted for them to have any impact, given today's fragmented market structure.","I'd like to talk about co-location and why it's important that it remains a regulated business. We believe that co-location is the most fair way to serve both the latency and non-latency-sensitive customers.","Let me illustrate. ICE's commodities business uses third-party data centers to house our matching engines. And years ago, we began hearing of traders that were offering to pay our data center operator larger fees if they could move their systems closer to our matching engine.","We decided to work with our landlord to develop cable links and router configurations that were equal for everyone in the building who were trying to connect to us, regardless of where their specific location was in that building. Thus, it was out of a sense of preserving fair access that the co-location business was born.","We continue to examine the co-location offerings at our data centers to make certain that their use is appropriate, codified and fair.","And finally, let me mention that the U.S. equity market simply has to look to its cousin, the U.S. equity options market to adopt best practices and a good regulatory model. For example, off-exchange trading is allowed, but those trade opportunities must be offered to others in regulated markets. Market makers have true price quoting obligations, and in return, they receive fee discounts and additional messaging capacity.","Exchanges have rules and fines to deter excessive orders from being sent and from being canceled. All of these features are very similar to what we've already implemented in our futures market, and all of these features in the U.S. equity options markets are regulated.","Clearly, we spent a lot of time during my tenure at ICE thinking about and solving for better market structures, whether it was the market for OTC energy, the market for Credit Default Swaps or now the U.S. cash equities markets. And I believe that one of the things that ICE does well is to facilitate change for the better that help our markets to grow. And I'm really hopeful that our team can advance the dialogue here.","In the meantime, as we've discussed today, we're busy executing on a range of initiatives that we now have listed on Slide 21. Each of these is helping us to capitalize on the many opportunities to grow and serve our customers in an expanded way.","We closed on the NYSE transaction just about 6 months ago. And since then, we've implemented a dividend, we've completed the acquisition of the Singapore Exchange and clearing house, and we've led in the global listings business.","We completed several milestones related to the IPO of Euronext and the sale of some of our technology businesses while delivering on expense synergies and rolling out many, many new products. We launched our Benchmark Administration business, covering now both LIBOR and the fixed indices.","We began developing a new trading platform for our U.S. cash equities business and our equity option exchanges, and we continue to transition the Liffe exchanges to ICE.","We're not waiting for the business to come to us. We're going to where our customers need us to be, and we look forward to continuing to report to you on this progress.","I want to conclude my remarks by referring you to Slide 22. And note that ICE's growth is consistent and we have found opportunities for growth amid change. We focus on our customers' needs every day, and in doing so, we've been able to drive shareholder value.","So I want to thank our customers for trusting us with their business, and I want to thank our team for delivering these great results.","With that, I'll turn it over to the operator, Emily, for a Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Yes. The first question is on expenses, just to get away from the market structure debate for just 1 sec. But Scott, just following your walk on expenses, if you take your $463 million, add the $8 million onetime, you had $471 million. And I think I've got here where there's $15 million of extra Euronext to get you to $485 million in the low end. But it doesn't seem -- if you double the synergies in the quarter from -- to $220 million, I think you'd expect to start realizing, I guess, at least $25 million-or-so additional. So I'm just trying to follow the walk here and the realization of this -- the doubling of the synergies in the quarter.","Scott A. Hill","Yes. So, Rich, you did the walk almost perfectly. The only other thing I would add is in the second quarter, we'll see a little bit of an increase in our noncash expense. We were a little delayed in issuing our performance-related restricted shares this year. And so we only had 1 month in the first quarter. We'll have 3 months in the rest of the quarter. So that will move you right back into the middle of the guidance once you add in the $15 million of Euronext expense, which again, for clarity, is 100% of the reason the guidance went up and is more than offset by the additional revenues that we would expect based on first quarter volumes and the clearing agreement. But your question about the synergies, Rich, what I was saying and what I said in our February earnings call was that the first quarter expenses reflect that $220 million achievement. It's in the run rate. And then what I also said on that February call, and I'll repeat here, is that we would expect a little bit more. I think I said $15 million to $20 million as you go through the year of additional synergy realization. But that's going to come from the work we're doing to integrate the corporate staff, to integrate the Liffe business, and so that's going to be more in the back end of the year. And so what I said then, and I'll repeat again here, is we would expect 1Q, 2Q to be kind of stable. And then as you get to the back end of the year, it will trail off a little bit as those synergies bleed in. Also embedded in this, consistent with what we said in February, is we are making investments. I said $40 million to $50 million that would support revenue growth of $100 million to $140 million. If you adjust for disc ops, we drove over $30 million of revenue growth in the first quarter alone. So we are seeing the revenue growth. We are making the investment to continue to grow our business.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","That helps. That gets me there, and now back to the market structure. Jeff, thanks for all the detailed comments. Now you can see what you've been missing just being a derivatives exchange recent prior. So -- but I guess the question is -- it gets to the topic of what you can do unilaterally and what you can't. I've seen you stepped up in regards to the order types. But in regards to market data, you need the industry. And so anyway, the question is on the maker-taker model. Some at best -- if you're that dead set against it, why don't you -- you could take a step. Can you explain why you couldn't? And I believe it has to do with best execution. And what do you see as the one priority thing that will get -- reduces complexity and fragmentation that we're confronting in the equity markets, the cash equity markets?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Yes, so it's a very good question. I wish we could act unilaterally. But today, in the world of smart order routers, as we change fees, those smart order routers react instantaneously. And we suspect that if we went to a single 2-sided rate, we can look at others that have that rate, and those smart order routers will basically leave us in the dust. And the New York -- if you look at the volume on the exchanges and trading platforms that have low 2-sided rates, their market share is probably less than 1%. And we're not going to take the New York Stock Exchange down to less than 1% market share. It's why -- I think there is a mechanism already that the SEC has set limits on what exchanges can charge. And I'm really suggesting that I think those should be revisited, and I think the more support that the industry will provide for a revisiting of those rates, the more likely it is that the SEC will put that up on their priority list. I will tell you that we've had many, many meetings with the SEC at all levels, and I find them to be very engaged and interested in making sure that we have a well-functioning U.S. capital markets system. I've been very impressed with them, and they've been incredibly gracious to listen to me and some of my ideas. And so I have quiet confidence that as more people speak out about improvements, that we'll see the industry coalesce around some good ideas.","Operator","Our next question is from Christian Bolu of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Chinedu Christian Onwugbolu - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Scott, just quickly, just to make sure my math is right, if I just look at the core ICE segment expenses of $463 million and back out the Euronext expenses, and then I compare that segment to your expense account for the year, it feels like expenses, even for core ICE, is going up through the year. Help me just think about anything in terms of incremental investment spend versus the synergy you're talking about being realized at the end of the year.","Scott A. Hill","Yes. Again, I mentioned in my remarks that we had about $8 million of kind of one-off accrual credits that we had in the first quarter, and then I mentioned in answer to Rich's question that we had -- we'd have an increase related to our performance RSUs in the second quarter. Once you adjust those things in, there is no increase in expense 1Q to 2Q or right in the middle of the range, and we're right where we said we'd be and where we'd expect to be. And importantly, you guys recall that we suggested that once we peeled Euronext out and put the NYSE businesses in disc ops, that we would anticipate margins would've been around 48% to 49%. In the quarter, they were 51%, even adjusted for those one-off items. You take the guidance and put it against relatively flat revenues from the first quarter, those margins are going to remain right around 50%. So we're right where we've said we'd be, right where we would expect to be and very happy with the progress we've made.","Chinedu Christian Onwugbolu - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. I just want to hit on -- hit specifically on the European interest rate complex? And just more broadly speaking, how do you think about your opportunity in the longer-term products? Do you think you can actually win share from the current incumbent? Or is the focus here really more on creating kind of newer products?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","It's -- again, it's a good question. I mean, the answer is we really just talk to our customers about what their needs are, and then we try to solve for those issues. And that may mean, in some cases, share is taken, and certainly, it means that we're going to be creating new opportunities and ideas. And I'm quite proud of the fact that we stood up a brand-new business that had no employees and no history and convinced the market that we should administer the LIBOR oversight and now again convince the market that we should take over the administration of the ISDA fix process. Those businesses put us very, very close to our customers daily, hourly contact with people talking about where the markets are moving. And they, in part, domain knowledge to us and give us insight into where our customers are thinking, where they're having stress points. And I think couple that with the fact that I'm very, very proud of what our colleagues have built in our clearing infrastructure, with the really sophisticated models and the quants that we've been able to attract and hire who increasingly are getting deeper into managing risk. I think we're just incredibly well positioned. We're lucky to have the Liffe rates complex now come to us. And that's a very, very good starting point for us to do both things that you suggest, to take market share from others and also continue to launch new products. So I think long story short, we're feeling very, very good about where life has taken us right now. I mean L-I-F-E.","Operator","Our next question is from Mike Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So, Jeff, you gave an update on Euronext just in terms of the June timeframe. Maybe just give us an update there in terms of what other regulatory approvals have to get done? And then, Scott, maybe just when you look at -- I guess it's tough to go into too much detail. But when you look at the valuation out there and maybe more the ownership percentage versus what you guys can release, just how can that either shift or accelerate over time? Just your, I guess, cash deployment opportunities and not just on Euronext, but we put that together with tech and then just the overall cash flow of the business throughout the rest of the year.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Let me ask Scott to answer both questions since he's been really helping to drive that IPO.","Scott A. Hill","Okay. Yes, I'll tell you what I can on the process, Mike. As you would anticipate, the last step before we file the IPO later this quarter is we need the final approval from the College of Regulators. And I think we have a very good dialogue going on with them with regards to that process. We're well along in the process of putting the prospectus together, well along in the process of educating some of the potential investors. So we feel good about where we are in the process. That's why we've continued to stake this date. Clearly, we can't say with certainty when that regulatory approval will come. But we're pretty confident and feel good about where we are in the process right now but still, frankly, a lot of work to be done. With regards to what happens at the time of the IPO, that's hard to say without knowing what the market dynamics are at the time we launch or what the demand is at the time we launch. What I can tell you is what we've said publicly before, which is if required, we've committed to be a stable shareholder in Euronext for a period of time. But again, there's no certainty around that either as we move through the process. So I think the net of it is, we feel very good about where we are. We remain confident that we're on track to get it done. And to your question on cash use, as I said in the remarks, first of all, I thought the first quarter cash results really demonstrated the cash we can generate just from the business. Clearly, depending on the size of the stake we can sell on Euronext, that will help us accelerate our deleveraging. And then as you mentioned, the divestiture of the NYSE Technologies businesses will also fund that. So yes, we feel pretty good about where we are, not just with regards to the Euronext IPO but with cash generally and our ability to get our deleveraging done on time, if not more quickly, and then get back to our share repurchases and investing in our growth.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","All right. And then, Jeff, just a follow-up. Just on the outlook for volumes, and I know there's a bunch of different trends that can have impacts, but I guess, when we look at it, if we look at some of the energy products, you're definitely on the rate side and even on the FX side. There's a lot of things that are having impact, but if you look at some of the regulatory pressures on the big financial institutions and even on clients, in an indirect way, do you see that as having much of an impact? Or is it the typical things that tend to impact your business in terms of low volatility, some macro uncertainty? Just trying to get any insight on just what you guys look at what's driving it and maybe what could be some levers moving forward to pick up the volumes.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Yes. So let me just say natural -- the U.S. natural gas markets are the markets where Chuck and I really first started ICE, and they remain core to our hearts for that reason. And we had, in the United States, as most of you know, very cold winter, colder than expected. And so people who were trading natural gas either made a lot of money or lost a lot of money, depending upon where you were positioned. And so part of, I think, the quietness of the natural gas markets right now is that we're in a shoulder month period and a lot of our customers are going back and scratching their heads and looking at what happened over the winter before they decide their positioning for summer and beyond. That has nothing to do with -- that has to do with weather, not regulatory issues. That being said, there's definitely a sense of totality of regulation that is sweeping over our customers. And it's complex, and it's somewhat unknown. And there is some trepidation, and dates and deadlines continue to move. And so we do -- we are having unbelievably active dialogue with our customers, trying to help them as we figure out where we need to be to meet those same kinds of dates and deadlines. So there does feel to be kind of appall, if you will, on hedging and trading activity right now as people digest a relatively large and new regulatory regime globally. I think, however, as I said in my prepared remarks, the trend is for exchanges and transparency to be embraced. And we've positioned ourselves well as a transparent and regulated exchange and clearing house venue.","Scott A. Hill","And as we mentioned as well, I mean, we continue to see OI trends that are stable to significantly improving. We mentioned Brent and ICE being up 16% and 14% year-to-year. And, Mike, as we talked about from time to time, I look at the fact that we continue to see more people log into the system, more IDs. So the people are definitely there. The OI, the open positions are definitely there. And so as we mentioned in the remarks, once the volatility returns, we feel pretty well positioned.","Operator","Our next question is from Jillian Miller of BMO Capital.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","One thing that wasn't totally clear to me from the comments, do you think that we basically need to do away with maker-taker entirely to really see a healthier market? Or do you think that just a lower cap on access fees might be enough on that front? And I guess, like, how do you see the longer-term market outcomes being different for those 2 potential regulatory changes?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Yes, I personally think as long as we're talking about changing it, we should abolish it. I do not believe that it's healthy for exchanges and trading venues to pay for order flow. People talk about that as if it is liquidity, but because they are both maker-taker venues and then taker-maker venues, you end up with people buying on one venue and selling on another venue and not having any interest in really owning shares. And in other markets where we've got competitors that are doing massive payment for order flow and rebate structures, we end up with customers that want to advantage themselves of those. And what they do is they end up doing big low-risk trades, trades that are way out the curve, butterfly trades that carry no risk or low risk. They do them in the middle of the night. They do these big volume trades, and then the exchanges all go run around and talk about how fabulous their volumes are and use that as a marketing move technique to try to attract the true hedgers into a market that really, by that design, is incredibly illiquid and is a roach motel. And so I am not a fan of market structures that create false volume. I think there are plenty of people in our markets today, and you see them all through the historical markets that ICE has been involved in, that are willing to be market makers, legitimate market makers that will make a 2-way price and provide liquidity into the market, many using high-speed trading techniques that are helpful and meritorious to the market in exchange for access, discounts and other traditional market-making compensation that does not involve payment for order flow in the form of maker-taker or direct subsidies. And so I don't know why we wouldn't just go all the way. I think if you reduce this, it will certainly help. But again, false volume signals, I think, are as wrong as false price signals, which -- in which case, most people would go to jail. And I don't know why we should make the distinction when we all know that our customers are looking at both in making investment decisions.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, that's helpful. And then, Scott, you had mentioned that there was, I think, you said $30 million of revenue growth in the first quarter alone that came from investments that you had made. And I apologize if I missed this in some other prepared remarks, but could you just give us a better idea for kind of what that was related to, like where that $30 million came from? Was that investments post-transaction, like, related to the deal? I'm just a little bit confused there.","Scott A. Hill","No, I didn't link the 2 directly. What I said was in the first quarter, we did see $30 million of revenue growth. If you adjust 2013 for discontinued operations revenues and look year-over-year, we were up about 4%, a little more than $30 million. And what I was suggesting was, we are making investments this year to continue to generate revenue growth. So I was really just talking back to the same comments I made in February.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First on other revenue, a hefty $134 million this quarter, and you've done some rejiggering to what is reported in that line. At this point, what is the composition of other revenue? How variable should it be from 1 quarter to the next? And why was the guidance down versus 1Q levels?","Scott A. Hill","Yes. So, Ken, I think in my prepared remarks, I mentioned that there are membership fees, there are transaction services, there are the corporate governance businesses that we own. And so if -- there are networking colo, so there are a number of items that make up other. It's a bit of a mishmash. We had a few million dollars in the first quarter related to a termination of a contract that won't continue through the rest of the year. We gave guidance for the quarter of $120 million to $130 million. And I think you could expect -- and by the way, you take out the few million dollars to -- for that onetime, we would have been right at the top end of that range. And I think similar to what you've seen in the past, through ICE other revenues, you should expect stability in that range throughout the year.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And then maybe just I wanted to hear additional comments on Nat Gas. Given the volatility in January and February, are you hearing that this is or will lead to how much is hedged and how gas is kind of traded going forward? And is there any merit to a potential transition to more shale gas trading where ICE has such a dominant presence?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","I think -- we look at our OI trends. And the -- while trading has been subdued in these shoulder months, the OI trends are still quite good in North American natural gas. In Europe, as I commented, like, our -- what we've been able to do there is unbelievably successful. And so many of the global trading companies are -- have been active in Europe while they've been quiet in the U.S. So we've seen them kind of shift their market-making, risk-taking appetite to where the markets warrant. So I don't see anything long term structurally negative. It's just we are aware that it was very, very interesting over the winter on some of -- where some of our customers were positioned. And they were either right or wrong, many of them. And so people go back and rejigger their models and think about their personnel and think about their capital deployment. And it feels like that's what they're doing over these spring months.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. But in terms of corporates, the corporates aren't changing the way they hedge to go to Pennsylvania gas as opposed to Henry Hub.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","No, not really. Henry Hub is still is the marker for the U.S. and people still continue to use it. And as we've seen in other markets, there are imperfect benchmarks that exist in the world and we can all talk about how we could design a more perfect one, but the market tends to try to just continue to evolve and adapt around the imperfect ones and as opposed to abandon them. And so we -- that's really what we see going on here. And we've had a lot of dialogue with our customers about the potential to launch new delivery points or new contract designs or new specifications. Obviously, that's why we're changing our gas oil contract from a High Sulfur Gasoil, which is really heating oil to Low Sulphur Gasoil, which is really diesel fuel. And so, we do, do those kinds of things, but what's interesting, if you look at what we announced is that the market told us, don't launch a new gas oil contract, just change the one that we have now from high sulfur to low sulfur, so that things can continue and it's that kind of attitude that we're seeing by energy traders in the U.S. natural gas base.","Operator","Our next question is from Alex Kramm of UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I want to start with coming back to expenses, but maybe ask a little bit more vague longer-term question. I think, historically, ICE has done a really great job of cutting expenses and discretionary expenses when you have lower volumes. If I look at your, I think, your proxy right now, for example, I think a lot of management compensation is also going to be tight. Your synergy realization at the same time, those have a much bigger organization that's now doing things like listings in other parts. So as you look at this current environment and the volume environment, if that persists, but you do well on other things like [indiscernible] you still have the kind of discretionary or that flexibility on the comp side as we approach the end of the year?","Scott A. Hill","100%. Yes, we are a performance-based pay company and we remain a performance-based compensation company. So that flexibility will absolute exist. I think we've been pretty explicit. Look, we understand that there's a lot of noise in putting these 2 companies together, and we're trying to be very explicit, more explicit than -- we haven't given revenue guidance before and we gave you a number, we are trying to break our expense guidance down into pieces to be helpful, but if you look at that guidance, I mean, it's reflective of what would be a very good year. If we don't hit those numbers, our compensation will be adjusted accordingly across the board.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Alex, the biggest issue is that this particular management team that's sitting in this room on this call doesn't really want to run a big bureaucratic organization. We just -- it's not what we do well and none of us enjoy it and we enjoy feedback directly from customers. And you can only get that when you are running incredibly flat and you get the senior management dialoguing directly with employees that are touching customers day in and day out. So the culture here is just one where we don't want to be that and we don't like it. And as a result of that, we're not going to tolerate a lot of bureaucracy.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. And then, maybe secondly, just coming back to the European interest rate business for a second, I think you gave some highlights of new product launches, and things like that. But can you talk about other things that you've been -- maybe doing behind the scenes that maybe not be as obvious like obviously, I think you changed some market maker incentives? And then, Scott, does that actually help the pricing? And should that continue to help pricing? And then, but also, in terms of your sales organization or other things that you do when you interface with your customers, I mean, what are you doing different than maybe that Liffe did not do as well in the past?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","This is Jeff. Let me try to tackle that at a high level. First of all, the main thing that we're doing is we're pushing the Liffe and the ICE organizations together and we're taking the best people from those 2 organizations. At the same time, we're pushing the Liffe products onto the ICE trading platform because we have -- we think better distribution or lighter weight platform or platform that's easier to deploy, it's accessible via the Internet, and so we're doing a lot of technology work to really modify the traditional commodities-based ICE platform to handle a wide range of financial products, including some that are incredibly complex. We're also looking at our interest rate footprint as a global footprint, and we're combining our interest rate products in ways that will give economic offsets in clearing, but also, we'll be complementary to the way people trade and we're designing the platform usage to try to exploit that. And in that regard, when it comes to pricing and market maker schemes and what have you, we basically are moving from the Liffe model to the historical ICE model. And just aligning, pricing and schemes and things to what we believe works for us and the comments I made about market structure for the equities market apply to our views on all of our markets and how we think about rebates and market maker schemes and payment for order flow and limiting high-frequency traders to those that have meritorious behavior. And all of those kinds of things are kind of built into our thinking and are built into the ICE platform and so there's a lot going on right now around those products. It represents a huge opportunity for us, so we're quite focused on it. While I spent a large portion of my prepared remarks talking about the U.S. equity structure, that's largely because it's in the news. The reality is, as you know, it's not a particularly large business for us and we have incredible flexibility to try to make some changes to that business, because we have the opportunity of scale. And so we speak with one voice here and I think that's how you're going to see us operate in the interest rate complex, which I think is materially different than some of our peers and I think it will be well-received, frankly.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, So Scott, then anything on the pricing on the interest rates you want to call out?","Scott A. Hill","No. Again, I think it had not a particularly material impact on the pricing overall and you have seen it to continue to expect pricing similar to other proxies, reasonably stable.","Operator","Our next question is from Niamh Alexander of KBW.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","If I talk about the cash, you suggest so -- such a great track record with the cash earnings consistently kind of exceeding the operating earnings and the returns on the capital. Now I see you're kind of upping the CapEx guidance here and then going to the bottom of Slide 21, you seem to be investing in a new matching engine for U.S. engines. I guess I'm a little concerned because your predecessors, NYSE, have historically -- we've kind of examined the organization, as we used to cover them, we always covered ICE. I mean, it was such a story of contrast and you're kind of minimizing the CapEx and maximizing your returns and still having minimum downtime, whereas New York kind of was constantly throwing cash into its systems and reinventing the systems and still having kind of very low margins. So I'm a little nervous that you're raising the CapEx guidance here and you seem to be investing in, yet again, another engine for U.S. equities and options, and that's been done by them for several years. So just help me reconcile the two?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Neve, this is Jeff. Let me start. What we decided to do at -- in the cash equities and equity options business is to standardize on one lightweight, easily deployable and high-capacity platform. What the past management inherited at NYSE were 5 different exchanges that have 5 different platforms and they spent a significant amount of time and energy to get those platforms to work together as a single cohesive unit and they should be credited for that because they're 5 disparate systems. What we want to do now is just really take that to the next level, which is replace all of that with a single platform because the differences between market structures in those businesses are not great enough to warrant having different platforms. But there are, frankly, there are different features between different regulatory exchanges, largely revolve around maker-taker pricing and the way market makers are compensated. And again, owing to our earlier comments, we want to standardize that. We want to simplify that. We want to have a single, fast, lightweight platform that is reliable and so we're making a one-time investment. What will come out of that and we think is a great return on invested capital because we're going to so dramatically simplify things that will be able to shed a lot of excess complexity and things that add to decreasing reliability by the incumbent system. We've got that kind of DNA inside ICE. We started the company at the height of the Dotcom boom. We really believe in embracing low-cost hardware that is easily deployable and that has a lot of redundancy in its networking design. And so we're bringing that kind of mindset to this new product.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And just, I guess, for my follow-up, on Euronext, can you walk me through your interest or desire to have to -- what scenario will you still be consolidating Euronext? I'm just trying to get a sense, I guess, basically of, if there's enough demand, would you be interested in kind of no longer consolidating or no longer having a controlling interest in the organization, if there's enough demand and if the structure allows that?","Scott A. Hill","Yes, Neve, that -- whether we consolidate or not, it is pretty straightforward accounting. If we've got more than 50%, we'll consolidate it, if it's less than 50%, we won't. Clearly, we said early days that we didn't think we were the optimal owner of what is an attractive business. But it's a business that serves local markets and we didn't bring much to the table. And so there's no particular goal on our side to own a majority and to consolidate the results. What we're going to be able to sell at the time of the IPO that I mentioned earlier is going to depend on what the market dynamics are, but we don't have any desire to continue to consolidate the business for any long-term period.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","So is this valuation -- are there certain valuation levels you'll be willing to sell more, but it pays you more to kind of keep it?","Scott A. Hill","Yes, that's exactly right. Sorry to step on your question, but when we are -- as we talk about market dynamics, price, demand, all of those factor in.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Neve, I think -- Jeff -- this is Jeff. I think, we're -- it's going to be one of those situations where shortly before we take the business to the public markets, we're going to look at the markets and look in the mirror and talk to our advisers and try to make the best decision on behalf of our shareholders, of what is the immediate benefit of exiting versus what is the longer-term economic benefit of keeping and what will the market allow us to do and we're just going to stick our finger in the wind and try to make the most informed decision that we can at that moment in time. So we're prepared for any eventuality. I mean, fortunately, Scott has done a very good job with the debt that we've been able to secure that gives us a lot of flexibility. And as you can see, we're generating a lot of cash that allows us to service that debt. So we have a lot of flexibility in looking at that market as we move into the IPO.","Operator","Our next question is from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sorry, another one on expenses, but given the reaction from investors, I think, today, it's clear that it's still kind of a concern out there. But maybe if you look at the guidance for the ICE segment on the operating basis, and somebody else talked a little bit earlier about your ability, historically, to kind of deliver operating leverage on the positive side even in a tough revenue environment. So within the $1.56 billion to $1.58 billion, Scott, can you give us a sense of what kind of volume or revenue backdrop you anticipate embedded in that expense guidance?","Scott A. Hill","Yes, look, I think people saw a headline that expense guidance was up and the stock is up on that, but to me, that's a buying uptick, because we didn't say anything different, right? What we said about expenses is 100% consistent with what I said in February with one exception, and that's that we're going to add expenses related to Euronext, predominately related to the clearing arrangement that started on April 1. We said our margins will be 48% to 49% with that Euronext and NYXT, they were more than 50%. All the expense guidance due for the year, again, on revenues that similar to what we saw in the first quarter, it's 50%. The expense in the first quarter reflects a run rate of over $220 million of synergies, more than 40% is already done. That's what we said in February, it's true. We said there will be some investments, as we go through the year, some additional synergies as we go through the year and we said we'd grow revenue. In the first quarter, we grew revenue of 4%. So again, we'll go look at whether or not maybe there's some lack of clarity in the guidance, but it is very consistent. It is very positive and it's right on track with where we expect to be.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then speaking of the stock and the buying opportunity, I guess, you guys have said in the past that it's frustrating that your hands are kind of tied, that you can't take advantage of buying back stock here. Now assuming that the divestitures kind of take place as you would expect, but also understanding that there's a Eurobond that you would like to retire next year. Can you speak to your flexibility to perhaps pay down the commercial paper this year to kind of get the leverage ratio in the right place and start the buyback sooner?","Scott A. Hill","Yes, so that's one of the reasons why we shifted a lot of it at the end of the commercial paper, that is easily repayable once we've got the cash in hand to do that. We are looking at the dynamics for an early payment on the Eurobond and what that would entail. We're in discussions with the ratings agencies on how they would treat it if we had the debt but we also satisfied cash. With that [indiscernible] net debt treatment, so that our leverage would be viewed at a point where you can say we can get back to executing on the authorized share repurchase that we have today. So I feel pretty confident that once we get through the Euronext IPO, with, as Jeff said, the strength in our operating cash flow, that we've got a very flexible debt structure that will allow us to get the deleveraging done efficiently.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And just a clarification on the incremental revenues from the Euronext clearing arrangement that is anticipated to starting, I guess, April 1.","Scott A. Hill","Yes, so again, the agreement started April 1. The net of the arrangement is there's some expenses that I mentioned, $9 million to $10 million, that would be incurred and revenues of $16 million to $17 million. Just to be clear, that's really based on looking at first quarter volumes and what with the revenues have been based on those volumes. And then assuming similar volumes in 2Q is what it would yield, but embedded in that, obviously, is that amount of revenues will be tied to the derivatives volume that is related to the clearing agreement.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo Securities.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So another follow-up question on the volumes. I appreciate all the color you guys have given regarding what's happening in the market, but one thing I'm just kind of thinking about is kind of the decline in the volumes that you've seen. They seem to kind of be correlating exactly with a pull back from the banks and others that are kind of closing their commodity trading desks or significantly reducing them and also the slowdown in Asia. So you guys have mentioned those things, but I was wondering if there -- are any of those having an impact on your volumes?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","This is Jeff. We don't really see that. I would -- at least, it's always hard to know why somebody trades, but honestly, it doesn't feel like that it's that correlated to the banks. The banks that we deal with, as I said in my prepared remarks, those that have separated themselves from some of their trading operations. Those trading operations have largely gone other places and continue to give us business and the banks still are facilitating a lot of customer business that they tend to have always done. The banks have never been a particularly large percentage of our commodity markets per se. And these are widely distributed markets that are global and it is interesting that we do still see growth coming out of Asia. That's why we want to own an exchange and clearing house in Singapore. And if you look at our energy business, amazingly, to me, our European energy business, what people think of as our historical European energy business, has less volume coming from the EU than it does from places outside the EU, as we sit here today. Its growth has been incredibly global and incredibly dispersed. So I think, U.S. natural gas was -- is really a weather-related issue. There are structural changes going on the gas market, but volumes, specifically tend to be somewhat volatility-related and gas oil we're changing the spec and so people are adjusting that. And the interest rate complex in the U.K. is waiting for the Bank of England and the U.K. economy, which we have cautious optimism has turned the corner and is improving and we'll start to put volatility in the rates business, so all those things feel like us -- like a spring that's coiled for upside, particularly when you lay over our open interest trends on it. And none of that has anything to do with the way banks are restructuring, in my mind.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And a quick follow-up for Scott, just kind of a point of clarification. Again, sorry, Scott, on the synergies and expense guidance. So I know the expense guidance excludes NYXT. But one thing, I just want to make sure I'm getting right. The remaining synergies you guys have left, does that also exclude NYXT or are there expenses embedded in there related to NYXT as part of your synergies that are remaining?","Scott A. Hill","Now that's a great question. So we had about -- of the $220 about $35 million to $40 million of that came from the NYXT business, which is now sitting in disc ops. Those businesses that we are divesting or have shut down or all in disc ops, as we go forward, I think the simplest way to think of it, is the rest of the synergies you're going to see show up in the ICE segment expenses.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So it all hit the P&L then?","Scott A. Hill","Yes.","Operator","And our next question is from Bill Katz of Citigroup.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","As we think about the combination of ICE and New York Stock Exchange. I think one of the themes was that you might be able to get more expenses out of the business than you maybe have or articulated. So based on sales commentary, it sounds like you're going to spend a little bit first, but we're now at a point where the incremental synergies of the business might be more on the top line or could there still be some more incremental savings that you could see on the other side in 2015?","Scott A. Hill","I think the opportunity exists for both. One of the key expense synergies that we're working on, it's not even really the integration, it's frankly, the merger of Liffe into ICE Futures Europe on 2 1 site. It's already sitting in 1 clearing house, but on 2 1 platform. And one of the things that we've seen historically, as we move more people onto a single platform, that tends to boost trading. You just get more people staring at the screen, more people who are able to trade, et cetera. And so I definitely think that there are synergy opportunities on the top line related to that, setting aside that the opportunity that exists as the European economy tends to -- starts to improve or continues to improve and we continue to launch new products. So I definitely think there are top line opportunities. And look, I think you said it exactly right. One of the reasons that we're making the investment that Jeff described earlier in the NYSE Technology platform is because we believe a simple, elegant, single technology platform would be much less costly to maintain than 5 separate technology platforms. And so I do anticipate that we will continue to find expense synergy opportunities. I'm not saying that 500 is more today, but I'm saying there's an opportunity for 500 to be more and I think as a management team, we've demonstrated a very good ability to get expense out where those opportunities have existed.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","And maybe I should mention, this is Jeff. We're well along on how we're going to move to a more simple technology model inside NYSE and the related exchanges and we have a competitor that is going to be moving people on the new platforms and so we're looking at when we can move and the timing around that, so that we don't put the industry through too much stress. But we are making rapid progress that will allow us to both cut costs and simplify and grow that business. We believe that, I think it would be meaningful in the not-too-distant future, given the speed that we've been working. We didn't announce it, but we've been -- we've respectively been working on that platform since the first day that we acquired the company and things are going well in terms of how we've been able to organize and get ready to deploy that.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So then my follow-up question comes back to market structure. And Jeff, I appreciate your comments. As you think about everything you've mentioned, it seems like there's pros and cons for both the industry, as well as ICE. How should we think about the forgone revenue or economics that might come about from some of these promulgated changes. Obviously, [indiscernible] have to get versus the opportunity for maybe some consolidation of fragmentation?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, I think to a certain degree, the exchanges are somewhat responsible for the fragmentation of the market by what was perceived as innovation with all these new order types and rates. And to me, it's not completely surprising that people wanted to flee those markets and trade elsewhere. Today, you have in the United States about 40% of the business that is not trading on exchanges and that's quite sad and it's definitely impacting in less liquid names. The price discovery process, you've got conversation about whether or not we should move to $0.05 pick sizes, whether we should do other kinds of stimulations to try to bring people back to some of the more illiquid names and the reality is, I think the easiest way to bring people back to transparent markets are to make it easy for them and simple for them to access those markets. And so, I think, whatever we would give up in some of the \"innovative things\" that we have at our exchange, we would more than make up in volume. Beyond that, what's saddening about the U.S. equity market is that when I go out and talk to my friends, they do not have confidence in those markets and that is a -- trying to take a bigger piece of a shrinking pie is a silly business, and we should all be trying in this industry to grow that pie. And yes, we can bang each other's heads and compete for pieces of pie, but the reality is, if you look at the quality of people that are writing algorithms, these people are literally some of the smartest people in the world and we, as an industry, have been deployed on trying to get pieces of a shrinking pie and it's just from a societal standpoint, it seems like a misallocation of resources. So I'm quite confident that we can simplify the model, make it easy to access, that it will grow because the markets were up over 30% last year in the United States and who wouldn't want to be 30% richer in their liquid net worth today? And if our entire U.S. pension obligation were levered against a 30% increase, we would be in a substantially better place than we are today for our retirees. So I think that, that thing can grow. But it's got to become simpler and easier to access and I think The New York Stock Exchange, as I said before, will get more than its fair share of the business. Until we get there, what we're seeing us do is investing and making it simpler, easier, smaller and less complicated and that is something that we control, and that's what we're doing and the small investment that we're making in that platform, we believe, will have, as I said, a very high return on invested capital as we simplify those companies.","Operator","Our next question and our last question today is a follow-up from Alex Kramm of UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Guys, real quick. Since you legally separated ICE and Euronext, do you -- can you actually already give us the kind of net debt balance that Euronext is going to be carrying? I don't think it's in the Q.","Scott A. Hill","No, it's not in the Q. It's not publicly available. Sorry, but just to be clear, what we've legally separated was Liffe out of Euronext, not Euronext from ICE. So it's not a separate company yet. Although, its management team quite successfully ran the first quarter in a very independent manner.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then, just maybe secondly, and sorry to come back to the U.S. equities market structure, but Jeff, I think you said that you have a lot of ideas, a lot of things that you think should change in equity market structure. But it sounds like to some degree, you also acknowledge that it's different to drive change because volumes would just go somewhere else and you would lose market share, but to one degree, I would say, you have 3 markets if you run in equities today and one of those markets EMEX or MKT, whatever it's called to these days is obviously doesn't have much market share. So why don't you start experimenting? Like why don't you try to drive some of these changes that you think should be right in some of those markets and then go out there and talk to customers to acknowledge them?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","First of all, I'm smiling because you think about the name of that business in the same way I do, which is I don't understand it. It doesn't have a lot of brand equity and it's something that they were talking about. But beyond that, we never talk about the things that we're doing behind the scenes. We'll roll out our businesses when we think it's appropriate, but you can rest assure that we're looking for opportunities, talking to a lot of people and looking at the assets that we have in much of which in the way you're thinking about it. And what I wanted to talk about on the call today, were the things that the industry should be doing, but I don't necessarily want to preview the things that we're doing.","Operator","And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeffrey Sprecher for any closing remarks.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Thanks, Emily. I want to thank all of you for joining us on today's call, and we're continuing to move a lot of parts and pieces and advance our business, and we'll continue to upgrade -- update you on that progress on these initiatives as we move through the quarter. And thanks again for your participation today.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"11987":["IntercontinentalExchange (NYSE:ICE) Q2 2012 Earnings Call August  1, 2012  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Kelly L.

Please go ahead.","Kelly L. Loeffler","Good morning. ICE's second quarter 2012 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investor Section of our website at theice.com. These items will be archived, and our call will be available for replay.","Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the company's annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which was filed with the SEC this morning.","With us today are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO;  Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Chuck Vice, President and Chief Operating Officer.  We'll conduct a question-and-answer session after our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call over to Scott.","Scott A. Hill","Thanks, Kelly. Good morning, and thank you, all, for joining us on the call today. We're pleased to report our 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth. This solid second quarter performance continues the momentum from the first quarter and reflects solid top line growth enabled by record futures volumes and disciplined expense management that delivered increased operating margin.","I'll begin this morning on Slide 4 of the presentation with an overview of our performance in the first half of the year.","Healthy volumes across our futures and OTC energy market yielded revenue of $716 million, up 9% compared to the first half of last year.","Net income attributable to ICE was $291 million, up 16% year-to-year, and operating margins expanded to 62%.","Diluted earnings per share rose 18%, and operating cash flow grew 14%.","Our focus on identifying and solving the challenges facing our customers gives us confidence in our ability to deliver double-digit earnings growth and strong returns on invested capital over the long term.","Moving to Slide 5, I'll detail our second quarter results. Consolidated revenues rose 8% over the prior second quarter, to $351 million. With expense growth of just 1% over last year's second quarter, operating income grew 13%, to $215 million, and operating margin expanded 2 points, to 61%.","Diluted earnings per share increased 19%, to $1.95. Finally, capital expenditures and capitalized software totaled  $18 million, and cash flow from operations rose to $180 million in the second quarter.","Turning to Slide 6. You can see the revenue and expense components of our second quarter results. Futures revenues rose 14%, to a record $169 million on record volume and ICE Futures Europe.","OTC energy revenue decreased 3%, to $101 million, while OTC credit revenue declined, at $36 million.","Taken together, our consolidated transaction and clearing revenues increased 6% to $307 million.","Market data revenue grew 21%, to a record $37 million, demonstrating continued demand for our globally relevant commodity market and related market data services.","ICE's second quarter consolidated expenses are summarized on the right side of Slide 6. Operating expenses were $136 million, up just 1% from the prior year and down from the first quarter. Our disciplined expense management coupled with solid top line growth drove our operating margins to 61% compared to 59% in the last year's second quarter.","During the second quarter, comp and benefits expense rose 4%, and we recorded $4 million of acquisition-related expense.","We expect ongoing M&A expenses of $1 million to $2 million per quarter, as we continue to evaluate a range of strategic M&A opportunities. And we continue to forecast full-year expense growth in the range of 3% to 6%, which we believe will enable investment in key growth opportunities, operating efficiency and solid earnings growth.","Next on Slide 7, I will highlight the record performance of our Futures segment during the second quarter.","Record revenue was driven by record average daily volume of 1.6 million contracts, up 11% year-to-year. ICE Futures Europe and ICE Futures U.S. posted record revenue in the quarter. This strong performance was once again led by our Brent Crude contract, which despite prices declining more than 20% during the second quarter, saw volumes rise nearly 30%, as its ascendance as the global benchmark continues.","This global readership is evidenced by the diverging trends in volume and open interest relative to WTI and the ongoing $15 premium of Brent. You can also see the growing preference for ICE Brent options, which resulted in our volume quadrupling year-to-year in the second quarter.","Also in the second quarter, our Gasoil contract grew 7% year-to-year, and European emissions contract volume rose 11%.","The EU commission on climate change recently confirmed the U.K. government's opt-out option platform for Phase 3, where ICE Futures Europe will provide that platform. We believe this will support our leading position for the third phase of the European Emissions Trading Scheme beginning in 2013.","While Brent, Gasoil and Emissions are our largest revenue contributors, our energy futures complex grew strongly, with U.K. natural gas, coal, heating oil, and oil and gasoline futures all posting more than 20% revenue growth over the prior second quarter.","Moving to ICE Futures U.S. Rising open interest in our agricultural contracts translated into 14% volume growth in the second quarter. Sugar volumes continued to improve, rising 7% year-on-year,  while cotton volume increased 31%. Also, during the quarter, we successfully launched new contracts for corn, soybean and wheat. We're seeing encouraging levels of volume and participation, and we will continue to develop these markets based on customer feedback.","Open interest across our Futures exchanges increased 30% year-to-year and reached 9 million contracts at the end of June.","Tomorrow, we'll report July average daily volume for our Futures markets. Month-to-date volumes reflect continued momentum from 2Q and are up more than 17% year-to-year.","Turning to Slide 8, I'll review our OTC business for the second quarter. OTC energy average daily commissions grew 3%, to $1.6 million. North American natural gas revenues were up modestly, to $62 million, despite tenure loads in natural gas prices.","Volatility, driven by warm weather conditions, natural gas options and the launch of new products, supported modest growth in trading activity.","Global oil revenues rose 23%, to $14 million, primarily due to the demand for our clear global oil contracts.","Revenue from OTC energy products launched since the inception of ICE Clear Europe, contributed $13 million in the quarter. We currently estimate that OTC energy commissions in July will average around $1.4 million a day in a relatively low volatility environment during what is typically the seasonally slow months.","Turning to our credit derivatives business, second quarter revenues were $36 million. This included $21 million from Creditex and $15 million from CDS Clearing.","Through July 2012, ICE's cleared nearly $33 trillion in gross notional value. We have open interest of $1.5 trillion and today, we offer clearing for over 340 CDS instruments. We remain the leader in CDS clearing, with a growing range of products and customers. And, with the recent CFTC pronouncement regarding mandatory clearing of CDS index products and as additional rules, such as portfolio margining and swap rules, are finalized, we anticipate improved CDS market later this year and into 2013.","I'll conclude my remarks on Slide 9. We generated $366 million of operating cash flows during the first half of 2012. We ended the quarter with over $1 billion in cash, no net debt, low leverage and access to a $2 billion undrawn credit facility. We generate consistently strong cash flows and have a very strong balance sheet. And as you would expect, we continuously evaluate the optimal deployment of our available capital. We consider many factors, including our operational cash needs, U.S. versus non-U.S. cash generation, tax policies, regulatory requirements and investment opportunities.","Above all, though, we focused on deploying capital in a manner that we believe will generate the greatest value for our shareholders.","We have invested not only in key organic growth initiatives, but also in strategically important partnerships, licenses and acquisitions that have allowed us to outgrow our competition and deliver returns on invested capital, not only better than our industry, but also well above our cost of capital and above the returns generated by our peers in the S&P 500.","At the same time, we've spent nearly $600 million since 2008 repurchasing our shares, and we have over $300 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization.","We know that many in our industry have chosen to pay a dividend and that some analyst have a view that we, too, could pay a dividend. However, we do not believe we should pay a dividend simply because we can. While others in our industry may have concluded that value accretive growth investments have disappeared, we disagree. Thus, we intend to continue to invest in growth opportunities and to aggressively repurchase our shares in an opportunistic manner. In other words, we do not intend to make a change in our capital deployment strategy at this time because we remain confident that we can more effectively invest that capital and continue to deliver earnings growth and solid returns on investment to our shareholders.","With that, I'll be glad to take your questions during the Q&A session. Jeff, over to you.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Thank you, Scott, and thank you all for joining us this morning. ICE again delivered double-digit volume and earnings growth in the second quarter in a phase of a fourth consecutive year of economic and regulatory uncertainty.","Amid this environment, we've strategically expanded our business, which has produced growth on top of growth. We're executing for our shareholders while providing a path for our customers, as financial reform moves from the legislative phase to implementation. We've positioned ICE as a central source for solutions as these new laws take effect.","We understand that opportunity exists within change even if that means we must change. So we recently announced the move of our soft commodities options markets from the floor to the screen.","The rapid expansion of our new OTC clearinghouse has now caused us to become deemed systemically important. Our new swaps data repository is launching, and the planned migration of our energy swaps market to regulated futures is under way.","I believe this is where ICE excels, such as the way we transitioned our markets to our own newly built energy clearinghouse amid the financial crisis in 2008; or the way we implemented position limits on OTC energy markets in 2010; or even last year, how we converted ICE Clear Credit from a U.S.-regulated federal reserve bank to a CFTC- and FEC-regulated clearing house.","Our ICE team is very adept at managing change, and the strong financial results that we just reported reflect our agility and our continued focus on growth.","On Slide 10, you can see that ICE has performed well in both risk-on and risk-off environments. I think there are 2 fundamental reasons for this. First of all, our business is focused on the requirements of commercially oriented hedgers that manage billions of dollars of assets every day. You could see this very high concentration of commercial customers in ICE's weekly Commitment of Trader reports.","These market participants have increasingly relied on ICE for everything from market data and trade confirmation, to clearing and technology, all of which are tailored to support their larger business goals.","Since the formation of ICE, we've taken an end-user, front-to-back office perspective, rather than a pure focus on techniques to attract trade execution.","We've completed M&A that's strategic in nature, rather than size- or scale-oriented, and this has created for us a nimble infrastructure that provides critical risk management tools that are relied upon regardless of market cycle.","The second driver of our consistent results has been our diversification across geographies and markets. Our traditional benchmark futures markets play a key-price discovery role around the world. And we work with the market to develop, list and clear standardized swap contracts that provide spread base location-specific flexibility to serve the needs of hedgers around the world.","As you can see on the chart here, this market depth has produced consistent growth over the last several years. And our product diversity will remain in place under our recently announced transition from swaps to regulated futures.","ICE's positioning in the global energy and agricultural commodity markets remains a competitive differentiator. Secular growth is driven by the demand for hedging and risk management that is required to manage prices of raw materials.","In the recent months, you've seen Chinese firms making sizable acquisition of commodity-related companies to meet the demands of growing infrastructure and population.","Several of these transactions have been in the European and North American natural gas and oil markets, and 2 involved North Sea oil fields, on which ICE's Brent Crude contract is based.","Additional Chinese investment is just the latest, positive development in the North Sea, which reinforces the support for Brent as the global oil benchmark.","It is also further demonstrates Brent's link to Asian energy markets, as well as the anticipated longevity of future oil production from the North Sea.","The reliance on Brent as a marker is due in part to the physical output of more than 2 million barrels per day, and its over 30 billion barrels in estimated reserves. As a result, Brent has used the price over 2\/3 of the world's physical oil.","You could see the strength of ICE's oil markets on Slide 11. ICE Brent futures and options daily trading volume is up 20% year-to-year in the first half of 2012, and our open interest is up over 100%.","The complementary relationship between Brent Crude and Gasoil has been a key driver of Gasoil's growth, with Gasoil serving as a global diesel benchmark to assist in hedging refining margins and refined product prices in Europe and in Asia. The trading volume of Gasoil on ICE has more than doubled in 4 years.","And finally, you could see the demand for Clear to global oil swap contracts has proven trading volume growth in 7 consecutive quarters of rising open interest at ICE.","At the end of the second quarter, open interest of cleared oil swaps contracts was up 57% year-over-year, to 2 million contracts.","Moving to Slide 12. I'll note that in United States last month, we marked the 2-year anniversary of the passage of Dodd-Frank. Dodd-Frank implementation has resulted in over 8,000 pages of new regulations so far.","The CFTC and the FEC recently finalized the swaps definition rule, which triggered effective dates in nearly 20 other rule-makings. This include swaps dealer registration, aggregate position limits and real-time reporting, among others.","The effective base for our customers generally range from the fourth quarter of this year through the first half of 2013.","As implementation advances, ICE is helping our customers to meet these new legal requirements.","Last month, ICE Trade Vault was provisionally approved by the CFTC as a swaps data repository. Approved for all asset classes, it is currently the only swaps data repository authorized in the United States.","Another initiative we've been working on is our transition of OTC energy swaps to regulated futures contracts.","We anticipate a seamless shift as the contracts will continue to be listed on the same trading platform and cleared by the same clearinghouse as they were previously. You may recall we did the same thing in 2006 when we transitioned our West Texas intermediate crude product from a swap to a regulated futures contract.","We believe this move will provide the best features of OTC in futures markets for our customers, and it will simplify their efforts to comply with regulation while meeting regulatory goals of increased safety and market transparency.","Another area of focus for us is the systemically important designation process. ICE Clear Credit was officially designated as a systemically important financial market utility in July. While this Dodd-Frank-mandated process has focused on U.S. institutions, similar exercises are taking place globally under the IOSCO framework.","All of our clearinghouses are highly regulated, and we think the global application of uniform IOSCO rules across clearinghouses will help reduce risk.","While several global rule-makings are still in process, regulators are pushing towards the G20 deadline for setting forth clearing rules by the end of 2012.","Last week, for example, the CFTC issued rules for the first set of products subject to mandatory clearing, which include credit-to-fault swap indices.","With over $32 trillion in gross notional value cleared to date, we remain the leading risk  management model for clearing CDS by a live margin.","Additional asset classes are phased into the clearing mandate and ICE will continue to lever our experience to provide additional services, including the foreign exchange product market. And we're working closely with the industry and regulators to ensure that rules and procedures around customer protection are now reinforced. There are a number of so-called -- there are a number of rules being implemented, including the so-called Corzine Law, the legally separated operationally commingled  regime, and the electronic verification of funds, and we believe these policies will support customer confidence in our markets.","On Slide 13, I'll update you on a few more items that we're often asked about. First of all, you can see that our customer growth has continued since the start of the year, and has coincided with the ongoing introduction of new products, services and technologies.","The demand for information about our markets is evidenced in the -- in 11 consecutive quarters of market data revenue growth.","This year, we integrated our YellowJacket platform more deeply into our infrastructure, and we renamed it ICE Chat. And we launched additional sophisticated mobile tools.","We continue to benefit from adding new contracts based on customer demand since the launch of ICE Clear Europe, with these products generating solid revenue growth each quarter.","Our emissions futures business has been a very strong performer for us, generating over $30 million in revenue in the first half of 2012 on 18% volume growth.","Our new grain and oil seed futures have gained tractions since their launch, and these increase our relevance not only in North America, but throughout Europe and Asia as demands for ICE's commodity markets grow.","Our joint venture in the BRIX power exchange continues to see growth in traded volume and in new customers.","And in June, Cetip launched its first phase of Brazilian fixed income trading on ICE's technology. These investments exemplify our focus on finding early-stage opportunities and building on them, and we're positioning ICE in Brazil in much the same way that we introduced technology and risk management to markets in the United States over a decade ago.","I'll conclude on Slide 14 with a progress report to update you on the 5 themes that we noted at the start of the year.","First and foremost, our core energy and agricultural complexes continue to benefit from strong secular trends in the global commodities markets, driven by emerging economies, price volatility and the rising demand for risk management.","In the first half of 2012, we introduced over 100 new products across energy, agriculture and credit. We continue to expand our footprint in emerging markets, and we broadened our options technology and options product offerings.","We made progress on our operational plans for transitioning our swaps to regulated futures contracts and launching our swaps data repository.","And finally, we continue to actively evaluate strategic growth based on our positioning and our long-term vision on how ICE can serve the global markets. We couple this with a focus on preserving our leading returns on capital and double-digit earnings growth.","As shareholders ourselves, our entire team is closely aligned with investors, and we continue to focus on creating pathways for growth.","I'd like to thank our customers for their business and their support in the second quarter. And I'd also like to acknowledge the ICE team for helping to serve their needs, and again delivering industry-leading results.","I'm very proud of our culture that drives us to innovate and grow by serving our customers each day. And so with that, I'll turn the call over to our operator, who can conduct the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rich Repetto from Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I guess, first question is for Scott. You spent some time to go over the potential uses of the $1.1 billion in cash. I guess, can we get more detail on the potential investments that you're looking at? And is there -- you've talked in the past about cash in the U.K. There'd be certain tax ramifications of bringing it back. But I guess my question, too, is if you bring in down the M&A or the acquisition-related cost per quarter, what are the big investment or opportunities out there?","Scott A. Hill","Yes, Rich. As is typically the case, I'm not going to comment on any specific acquisition opportunities, but, as I said in my prepared remarks, we do believe there are opportunities out there and you can look at the track record we've got. They're not all necessarily $1 billion-, $2 billion-opportunity. They're technology opportunities to add to what we've got. They're  asset class opportunities to add to the products that we offer to our customers. So if you look at the history of what our acquisitive activity has been, I think it gives you a good view into what we're thinking about. And a point of the remark was that we still think those opportunities exist. And so we believe that's appropriate for us to have capital available for those opportunities. And shifting to your second part of your question, just with regards to generally how we think about the cash that's available to us, I've said in the past that you could think of our kind of our cores or 0-level cash balance in the $250 million to $350 million-range. That's kind of our comfortable operational cash. You spoke a little bit about the U.K. versus U.S. We generate, now, less than 1\/2 of our income and 1\/2 of our cash flows come from the U.S. So we do have a lot of our cash flows outside the U.S. And as you know, the U.K. recently agreed that their tax rate would come down to 24%, and it's on a glide path to 23% versus the U.S. at 35%. So for me, to bring that cash back to the U.S. is not sufficient for our shareholders or for our company. And then as you'll likely know, you probably haven't dug through the details yet in the quarter, but as the regulatory capital requirements are being set, we increased our restricted cash in the quarter by about $30 million, reflective of increased regulatory capital requirements that we've seen. So we take into consideration all of those factors as we think about the use of our cash. And then, as I mentioned in my remarks, we focus on what we're able to do with it. And generating 19% returns on invested capital against a lack of 10%, we think we're flexed that we do a pretty good job being good stewards of our shareholders' capital.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Understood. It is a lot of cash, though, Scott. Anyway, the one follow-up I have, Jeff, the move from OTC energy to the listed -- a bold move. And I guess the question is, will you still connect? Will you still have energy SEF? And as a clearinghouse, will you still clear -- and what are the -- do you see this as a broad trend of the OTC markets, whether it be energy or other asset classes, moving into the listed environment? Yours was sort of unique, I'd think.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Yes. Those are both good questions. First of all, we do intend to register ICE itself, our trading platform, as a SEF, and we do believe that we'll be SEF trading of energy products. We, at ICE, have done a lot of work over the last decade getting into the physical markets that are not cleared and getting into certain bilateral markets that are not likely to lend themselves to clearing. And those, for sure, will trade on SEF-type platforms. We'll see how the market evolves in terms of its skew between futures and the OTC trading as time runs forward. But it's our intent, ultimately, to be a very responsive trading and clearing infrastructure for the marketplace so the business can get done. However, customers want to get their business done, and that ICE can participate in that workflow. So, I do think it's a bold move that we're doing. We're trying to show leadership. We're trying to show our customers some direction. We have been talking extensively with our customer base for the last couple of years in the United States, particularly around the implementation of Dodd-Frank. And we concluded in the last few weeks that this was the right moment because our customers are almost unanimously telling us that they like this idea and they want to push us there. I think it is foreshadowing trends in other asset classes. One of the things that I think our company and also some of our competitors deserve credit for in the energy and commodity space is that we have helped standardize the markets, in terms of their terms and the way they trade, so that those products can be cleared. And in doing so, the hedging techniques that exist in our space have relied heavily on standardized products. And I would suspect that in other asset classes, particularly as we know more about the new Basel III rules and the way dealers are going to be reorganizing and constructing themselves, we may see that there is a move toward standardizing those other asset class products that can be standardized. That would be my guess.","Operator","Our next question comes from Howard Chen from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Jeff, just a follow-up on the swaps to futures announcement. I mean, the benefits to your customers make sense to me and certainly, the additional transparency will be great for us in the investment community. But I'm just curious how you think this potentially impacts at the pace of new product delivery, the liquidity for some of these products that you may, otherwise, wanted to keep OTC for a while longer and just pricing.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","I think, net-net, it will have little to no effect on any of those things. We have been -- as a contingency, we've been planning for this move since the creation of Dodd-Frank. We suspected when Dodd-Frank was passed that this would be the likely result for us. And we've been building infrastructure and adopting rules and pricing and other things for the last couple of years in anticipation of potentially making this move. And so in that regard, it would be relatively seamless for us. There will be no procedures for the way we list products, the way we announce them. It think it will be evolutionary, not revolutionary. And we've become pretty adept at operating both futures and OTC markets. Howard, so one other thing is, for you and others that follow us very closely, if you look at -- if you really looked at last quarter's results that we've just announced, you'll see a very strong growth in the trading of energy futures products and a less strong growth in the trading of energy OTC products. I believe that there has been a fundamental shift under way in this regard for some time and I believe that our movement of OTC products into a futures environment is really reflective of a trend that is already under way. And certainly, it's what our customers have been telling us. So it's a natural conclusion. I also think that for government that they can really take some credit in all these complicated rules. They've really essentially brought many opaque markets into a regulated transparent environment that people understand. And so in that regard, I think it is -- the regulatory policies have been successful.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's really interesting. Yes, and my follow-up -- you mentioned Basel III briefly, but there's been a lot of discussion on central counterparty risk waiting and CVA proposals. Just, could you share your thoughts on what you're hearing? And how much are you hearing from clients, differentiating between better capitalized, more dynamically managed TCPs like yours and maybe weaker ones that are out there?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Howard, those are some, again, good questions and everything that you asked about is certainly work in progress and ongoing dialogue. But generally speaking, all the discussions we've had with senior policymakers has been that they want to make sure that capital rules encourage the use of clearinghouses. So regardless of how clearinghouses are weighted, I suspect that keeping trades bilaterally and opaque will have much higher weightings. I also think you can take some comfort if you look at the growth of clearing in the commodities markets. What's really been happening is that customers have been able -- they want to give us as many types of trades as they can so that they can net down their absolute exposure. And in doing so, they really net down their capital requirements. And I think there will be a continued role for major clearing firms in helping people with collateral conversion into clearinghouses that will make the posting of margin less onerous for ultimate end-users. But I think that the net risk that will come, be it clearing, will be, for many major customers, will be a nice surprise for them when they really see their true exposure. And they'll be able to see their true hedge, for example. I think, with respect to the various clearinghouses, the U.S. did a systemic overview of clearinghouses. That process is going on globally. I would expect that our European clearinghouse, where we clear a huge amount of energy and credit default swaps, will ultimately receive some kind of similar designations by the U.K. government under these IOSCO regimes. I think it's yet to be known how -- what a systemically important financial market utility is going to look like or how it's going to be ultimately regulated or what its ultimate capital needs are. That's part of the uncertainty that Scott mentioned in ICE, looking at our own capital needs and looking at the opportunities that the we may find in the marketplace for others that can't manage through their needs in terms of M&A.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Worthington from JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First, I wanted to dig into options. You've had huge success in Brent options. What is the outlook for options in your non-Brent European and U.S. products? And maybe where you do see the most promise at this point?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, sure. There's been a long-term trend towards the use of options in the cash equity space, even though the retailization of the use of options. They're becoming better understood, better accepted as risk-management tools. And so there's an overall secular trend going on there that we've been tapping into. And I think, as you know, Ken, we have been heavily, heavily investing in various technologies that try to move options more electronic. We certainly found a sweet spot this year. Basically in 7 or 8 months, the floor-traded options that were traded at the ICE Futures U.S., the old New York Board of Trade, coffee, cocoa and sugar, have moved electronic. I believe earlier this week, we were 96% electronic and 4% floor-based. So there is a movement and a customer preference towards electronifying these. I think as they become electronic and standardized, you will see the velocity of trading increase in those markets where there's already liquidity. And I think as traders look for alpha, as people are trying to hedge more complex books and as dealers reposition themselves and try to -- and brokers -- try to create value for their shareholders, there will be a movement towards the greater use of options and options strategy. So I do think that you'll see it move. Next, probably, much more in our Gasoil contracts. We'll have to move down the oil refining curve. I suspect you'll see greater use of options just levering off of Brent, for example.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, and then maybe regulatory side. We've had 2 FCM failures. What do you feel are the best outcomes from a regulatory perspective for the market? What are the realistic outcomes that would be, I guess, maybe most impactful for ICE, both helpful and harmful? And do the rules in the U.S. kind of transcend the U.K. and Canadian markets? Like does what happened in the U.S. influence what could happen with rules here in the U.K. or Canada, or are those regions likely to remain kind of as is or status quo?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Good questions. And I do think, first of all, that the infrastructure providers like ICE will have a bigger role in helping to manage customer risk. And in that regard, we'll be able to provide more services in charge for them. So I think that it -- this trend is probably in our company's best interest. But beyond that, we need to find a balance, and the U.S. is searching for it. And certainly, there's a lot of debate about it. And some of the trends that were already in place are being accelerated. So the market is not being caught flat-footed. There was already talk of customer improvements in things like electronic certification of funds on deposit that, to a large degree, helped uncover the PXG best Paragon issues. We're already well under way. I do think that what's happening here will influence events outside the U.S. I do think people are looking to what's going on here. One thing that's important for ICE is to maintain the role of the clearer and broker in the process. They play an important role for exchanges in providing connectivity in distribution and marketing and on-the-ground risk management to our customers. So it's important that we find a balance that keeps them in the business and incented to make money and provide services for their customers. That will be in our long-term best interest. But I do think that the clearinghouses and exchanges through technology and through bankruptcy regimes will play an increasingly important part. One last thing I'll share with you, Ken, is that I hope that whatever we do will continue to keep the onus on the end-user customers to think about who they give their money to. At the end of the day, you and I as consumers have choices on who we can use to manage our money. And I think it's important that customers realize that there will be protections in the marketplace, but there will not necessarily be implicit guarantees and that there's still an onus to manage your money wisely. And that exists in every other asset class and in every other jurisdiction around the world. And I hope that customers don't put unrealistic expectations on the futures markets.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jillian Miller from BMO Capital Markets.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I just want to touch on this year. From listening to the debates going on in the Parliament, it sounds to me like some form of open access is, I think, likely in Europe, probably not fungibility, but maybe something similar to what we have in the OTC markets now. I just want to get your thoughts on how something like that might impact your business. And are there any moves that you can make might protect you from something like that, just given you operate across a number of different countries and regulatory regimes?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, it's hard. First of all, it's hard to predict what will ultimately become of the regulatory debate that's going on in Europe. It's still an active debate. And I do think, similar to some of the earlier questions that I responded to, that Europe is looking at what the U.S. has done, and they're looking at what Asia is intending to do. And they want to find a balance and so there is not a regulatory arbitrage. So I don't expect that we're going to see an outlier in global regulation. In other words, I think global regulation is going to be relatively similar across jurisdictions. And I think -- and the reason I think that is because it's in regulators' best interest to do that. But that being said, the discussions about access for clearing are an active conversation, there are a lots of amendments that have been being tabled and developed in Europe and are under debate and discussion. So it's hard to say what the exact language will look like. But one last point is that we clear -- we have, as you know, a really important clearing infrastructure, and we take trades from hundreds of different venues into our clearinghouse, both in the form of regulated futures that are done off exchange and OTC contracts that are done outside of ICE. And we, more than anybody, set up our clearing infrastructure as a business to attract business, and we built the infrastructure to do that. And we've built pricing to accommodate that. And so I think that the trend, which is to push more business regardless of how it's executed into clearinghouses, is in ICE's favor.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then just on the grain product launch, volumes have been growing, but a little bit more slowly recently. And it seems to be having maybe plateaued around 4,000 contracts per day with open interest around this same mark. And I'm just wondering what your thoughts are on the product. Is it having the start that you anticipated? Did some of the changes that CME made kind of in response to the launch maybe arose from the competitive advantage that you are hoping for with the product? Or is it just a case of you still have very high hopes and it's just going to take a little while to build up the liquidity?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Again, it's a complicated question. But first of all, I'm actually pretty impressed with how well that product is doing for us. It's trading regularly with very tight markets, and there's still a lot of customer demand for that product and a lot of customers that are working with us in the background to get set up to make changes to their internal policies and processes to be able to get access to the product. So I'm actually pretty impressed because I was a bit of an internal skeptic of our own efforts this way. I do -- look, I'm an engineer by education, I bring that up a lot. But I know Sir Isaac Newton taught us all that for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction, and I know that and expect that. And it's a law of nature, so you don't try to change that. And so I expected that there would be competitive reactions. But the desire for ICE to get into this business was driven by a host of customer demands that I think are long-term and secular in nature and will continue to support those products regardless of competitive changes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Allen from EverCore.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","If we could just revisit kind of the expense outlook. When we look at the full-year forecast relative to the first half, it's pointing to expenses at $137 million to $145 million range, up sequentially from where we were at this quarter. I'm just wondering what will be the drivers of the sequential expense growth from here.","Scott A. Hill","Yes, I think, Chris, you may be taking the high end of the range to get to that view. I actually think we're trending more to do middle of the range for the full year. My expectation, as you look out at the next couple of quarters, is similar first quarter to second quarter, we were down. I don't expect third quarter to bounce up a lot from where we were in the second quarter. And I don't expect the fourth quarter to be materially different either. The one variable that we've got embedded in that is what happens with our bonus accrual. I think we're tracking to our typically very challenging budget through the first half of the year. So again, assuming that stays on target, my expectation is you're not going to see much of an increase and will end up somewhere in the middle to kind of 4-ish, 5% for the full year, which, by the way, is about where we are to the first half.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it, okay. And then just thinking about some of your growth opportunities. I mean, one that was not mentioned in the slide deck which you have talked about before, is the European natural gas opportunity. Any comment around that?","Scott A. Hill","Yes. That business continued to do very well. I touched on it ever so briefly in my remarks. It was one of 3 or 4 products that I listed off that saw a  growth of over 20% on a year-over-year basis. Jeff was talking earlier in response to one of the questions about where we're seeing options growth. We saw good options growth, I think, the options in the U.K. natural gas where the volumes were about 3x what they were a year ago. That business continues to do very well for us. And then, we also recently announced the deal that we're doing with Griffin, which is really targeting the European power and natural gas markets and looking at another avenue to bring bilateral voice broker business into our clearing out, into a more transparent venue. So I think we remain very excited about that opportunity. It is continuing to grow in its contribution to us, overall. So good performance in the first half of this year and our expectation is that there's a lot of runway in front of us for that product.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Kramm from UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So Scott, first of all, I want to come back to the first question Rich asked about capital. I'm not sure how much incrementally you can add to your previous answer. But just look at the slides, I guess Slide 9, the $1.1 billion in unrestricted cash, $2 billion undrawn, and if I look in my model in terms of free cash flow generation, it's like $700 million, $800 million over the next year or so. That basically gives you $4 billion in flexibility. So when I review your comments here, through technology, M&A opportunities, $100 million-plus or so. And then maybe, $1 billion or $2 billion sizable deals. I mean, you got a lot of that opportunity. You got a lot of money for those kind of opportunities and still have a lot of cash beyond that. So where is, maybe, the drive or the motivation to do stepped-up buybacks or something like that, given that you believe in the growth of the company, you should be buying back stock to participate in the growth more? So maybe flesh it out a little bit more.","Scott A. Hill","Yes, sure. So, Alex, first of all, we absolutely do believe in the growth prospects for our company. And as I mentioned in my remarks, since 2008, we've spent $600 million repurchasing our shares. We have over $300 million remaining in our authorization, and you should expect that to continue to act aggressively in share repurchase as a means of capital return. I won't debate with you or Rich or any other folks on the call, whether or not we could do a dividend. We do have a very strong balance sheet, low leverage, very strong cash flows. We can, but as I mentioned in my remarks, we don't do things simply because we can. We step back and ask ourselves, \"Where do we think we can put those dollars to the highest value use?\" And again, I'm not going to go into details now on the each of the individual acquisitions that we're thinking about now or ones that we may think about in the future. But what I would point you to is we have demonstrated consistently that we are good stewards of capital with strong returns, with good investments that have been value-accretive for our shareholders and we believe we can continue to do that. The other point I would make, too, and I've alluded to it is there are a lot of variables that are moving around today. Jeff touched on one earlier, which is, what's it going to mean to be systemically important? What are the capital requirements for that? We don't expect that they will be materially different, but we don't know. What's the corporate tax rate in the U.S. going to be? Are we going to be move to a territorial system? Or are we going to finally realize that being 11 points higher than the U.K. is a bad thing for the United States? That would make it more efficient to bring cash back from outside the U.S. What's going to happen with dividend policy and capital gains? Which is more efficient? Is 15% going to go to 0 or going to go to 45%? And is it going to go consistently or is it going to be mixed between dividend and capital gains? So there are lot of moving pieces right now that would suggest to me that making a decision on we're going to go one way versus the other, this isn't the right time to do it. And, again, we remain very confident in our ability to grow on return. And the last point I would make and emphasize, though, is -- Jeff and I haven't made this decision and our Board hasn't made this decision today, and then we'll get back to it and think about it again 2 years from now or a year from now. We constantly evaluate what the best use of our capital is and how to best deploy it. We'll continue to look at all the variables that are out there: the M&A opportunities, the tax policies, the regulatory capital requirements. And as we've done in the past, we'll adjust and we'll make changes in our capital deployment strategy as facts as circumstances change.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","All right. Just -- and then I guess for Jeff, looking at, I guess, what happened on the M&A side with the London Metal Exchange in Hong Kong. I mean, clearly, you were involved there as well. And I think in some of the public comments you've made about that asset, you could clearly tell that you were pretty excited about it and the opportunities that was changing some of the things around there, which Hong Kong seems like it's not going to do it. They're going to keep things pretty intact. So just wondering if, from an organic perspective, you think the opportunities to go after that market, another avenue into Asia, given that you've challenged incumbents before and have done so pretty successfully. Or if you think this is a market that is so closely knit that it's pretty hard to enter.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, first of all, you got a round of laughter in the room here that you didn't hear because it wasn't so clearly that we were going after that asset. We've never actually commented on that, and I won't start that process today. But I will say that whenever we have participated in auction-type M&A, we both think about how to play to win and we also think about how to play to lose. And I think you've seen us do that in many ways in the past. And the reason that we play to lose is to open up opportunities for us as a result of potentially a winner's curse. And so I'll just suggest to you that our company could not have gotten a fairness opinion to buy the London Metals Exchange for GBP 1.4 billion. I do think it's a great company and I do think it could have been a company that would have been interesting to potentially do business with. And I hope there will be opportunities to do business with it in the future under its new ownership. But that being said, we are pretty strategic around here. We pride ourselves on driving strategy and creating a roadmap for both the success and failure in various things that we do. And at this moment in time, we feel pretty comfortable with where we're sitting, and you can see it in our results.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Heinz from Stifel Nicolaus.","Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just a question on CDS execution. You've clearly been investing heavily on the clearing side. And you have the presence in the dealer-dealer space with Creditex. But do you feel you have the right combination of assets and platforms to have the type of business you want there long-term, post implementation of Dodd-Frank on the execution side?","Scott A. Hill","Yes, Matthew, I think we've very confident that the investments that we've made in the CDS space position us very well as the rules are finalized around Dodd-Frank. As you mentioned, we've got a very strong clearing platform. I said in my prepared remarks we now clear over 340 different products. We've cleared $33 trillion. We have well over $1.5 trillion of open interest. So without question, we are the leading clearinghouse. We had our best quarter in terms of buy-side notional cleared in the second quarter. So as I've mentioned earlier, we continue to see the march of the buy-side towards clearing. The CFTC recently announced that CDS indexes would be mandatory for clearing, which I believe started 180-day clock for the Category 1 traders, which is a vast majority of that market. So we feel very good about the clearing. In terms of the execution, again, we've been managing that business now for 3 years, really to deliver as much efficiency as we can. We continue to look at ways of getting more efficient, whether it's market -- moving markets more electronic. It's been the quarter we're up to 63% electronic execution. It's getting rid of brokers and spaces that are going largely electronic, such as in the index space. It's maintaining our share, our #1 ranking in the single main space, and in some of the structured product space, all with an expectation that -- and I'm sorry, just to round it out, and to build out ourselves. So the leverage the CDS execution platform that we've got and the expertise that we've got generally in execution technology in ICE to build the set for CDS trading. So I absolutely think we've got the right assets. I absolutely think that we've got the right customer engagement. And I am absolutely confident, as I said in my remarks, that as the rules gets finalized later this year and certainly into 2013, that as that market turns, we will be the biggest beneficiary.","Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow-up on the emissions business. You mentioned some of the opportunities there just very briefly. I was wondering if you can expand on that. It remains your most lucrative product in terms of RPC. I'm just wondering if we could get some more detail, and maybe the EU Stage 3 timeline and kind of your market share trends there.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Sure. First of all, I thank you for asking about it. When we bought out our partner in that business, a lot of people scratched their heads and said, \"Why would anybody want to be in the emissions business?\" And we felt relatively confident about our positioning in Europe. And so far, our results have exceeded our expectations. We were picked to build the U.K. auction platform, and there's a process going under way in Europe to pick a -- for Continental Europe to pick a platform, which I suggested on an earlier call, I don't expect that we will be a part of. But as a result of getting deeper into the way these contracts are actually created and administered by government, I think it further ingrains us. Our market share has gone dramatically up over the last few years since the competitors are reacting to us by massively cutting prices or trying to do other things to claw back some relevance at the margin that may be a little bit of a share skirmish. But it really is a result of the fact that we are so strongly positioned and continue to be and feel good about it. You do see the European government as a whole, both the U.K. and the EU, wanting to take proactive steps to continue for that market to grow and evolve. There is a real commitment to carbon trading in Europe, and the stress of the euro and the stress of the economy has not caused them to waiver, which is pretty amazing. And so, we have a lot of confidence in their continued growth over there.","Scott A. Hill","And the 11% volume growth that we saw in the quarter is despite some level of uncertainty with regards to what governments may or may not do with the emissions certificates. It's at a moment in time we are pivoting towards the Phase 3, which will run from 2013 to, I believe, 2020. But you have asked about the transition into Phase. I mean, one of the big things in Phase 3 or 2 of the big things in Phase 3 are: one, the emissions credits will start to be auctioned off, which I think will create some price volatility, and volatility tends to be good for hedging activity; and then the second big thing is you're going to see big transportation companies, airlines, and metals companies come in to trading. And so not only are you going to see the new auction activity, but you're also going to see a much more expansive set of customers, who have a need and an opportunity to hedge their emissions exposures.","Operator","Our next question comes from Roger Freeman from Barclays.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just to come back to the swaps to futures. Can you clarify this a little bit more, are you -- is the plan to basically replicate all of the energy OTC contracts as futures? Or are you going to consolidate them down to some more standardized list? And if so, does that create any basis risk issues? And will you do a list at all and ultimately let the market decide whether they OTC cleared over futures?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","That's a good question. We are going to own -- over a weekend, convert any open interest in any contract that we have listed to a regulated futures contracts, so there will be no change in the individual contract specification or the way it trades or the way it's listed on ICE. It will simply become futurized over a weekend. And any open interest that is in the clearinghouse will be deemed to be futures open interest. In terms of how we list OTC contracts, we believe that the vast majority of energy companies will want to trade standardized swaps in the form of futures, but there will be potentially some OTC business that will stay in the over-the-counter markets. And also, there are final rules that the CFTC is working on in the U.S. that will determine exactly what an OTC contract is. And so, we will make sure that we can clear all of the energy business. We're not trying to discriminate, but we're making a calculated, highly calculated bet that our customers want standardized swaps to be futures.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just following up on that, what does it take for this to occur in CDS that you have plans for that as well? Are you clearing or where are you on clearing financial CDS? And then just lastly, on the stops, the options, is it YellowJacket that really pushed the envelope to a point where you could get the electronic penetration up to where it is? I know that negotiating those complex electronic options was always a challenge in that.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Sure. Well, first of all, our focus on the futures conversion is in the pure commodity space. And the reason that that's our focus is, for 10 years, we've been working with the market to standardize those contracts and standardize them in a form that makes them: a, will be lifted on the central limited order book and cleared as futures -- in future stop clearing, in other words. In other asset classes, there's much less standardization as we sit here today. We have helped drive standards in credit to full swaps, and the market has been working on recasting that product to make it clearable. But it's -- there's still work going on by [indiscernible] and others to continue to evolve credit products, and there are unique aspects of credit products and of interest rate products and even foreign exchange products that, at this moment in time, don't necessarily lend themselves to futures because they involve off dates and cash flows and other kinds of very customizing bespoke features that don't have the same attributes that energy does. That isn't to say that they aren't going to evolve. I suspect they will, but we have a decade of working with the commodities markets to get us to this position. With respect to options, and there's actually a similar trend going on there, which is in the commodity space, generally, you can trade any strike price at any premium price. And generally speaking, our customers use some form of black shoals to calculate volatility, but nobody uses the identical black shoals tweaks, if you will. So it is highly tailored. What you're seeing happening is ICE has been evolving our technology to be able to clear and list tailored -- more tailored contracts, and at the same time, you'll see liquidity starting to concentrate around some contracts that ultimately, we think will help to drive standardization. So that process is in early days in commodity options, but the trend is certainly there. And as you know, in the cash equity space today, you have very standardized values, premiums and strikes that I would expect over time, commodities will start to trend in that direction. That will -- all of which I think will concentrate liquidity and increase volumes and give customers and brokers and dealers better tools for helping to manage risks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Niamh Alexander from KBW.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","On the credit derivatives, again, Jeff, and how much today is clearing in eligibility versus how much you think could be mandated to be cleared going forward? Because you're so kind of early ahead of the rules. I'm just wondering how much more of an opportunity is there without kind of the next phase of standardization and maybe some futures.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Scott mentioned that the way the U.S. clearing mandate is coming into effect is that Tier 1-type players will be the first to be subject to a clearing mandate. Those are basically the large banks and possibly some large funds. Though that's obviously the target group that we've been working with to help build our clearing infrastructure. So that's why Scott mentioned we are very, very well-positioned as the actual legal clearing mandate in the U.S. unfolds. The large banks that have a large presence in the United States have made commitments to the U.S. Fed to clear a large majority of their business. And those banks have been doing that. So there is those -- of new contracts that are being written, a large percentage of them by banks that are in the U.S., they have a large U.S. presence, have been going into clearing. What we would expect would follow under the clearing mandate would be banks that don't have as large a presence in the U.S. that have not been necessarily following that clearing mandate, as well as potentially a couple of large funds that have exposure to CDS that may be in that first tier. After that, we think things will unfold relatively quickly, where the entire buy side essentially will start to be drawn  into clearing, and you'll see that in 2013 in the United States. I think Europe will -- because Europe in the near legislation is working towards laying out their clearing mandate under the G20 rules to have visibility into that by the end of the year. You'll see -- I know from our conversations over there that European legislatures feel pressured to get moving on this. They don't want a regulatory arbitrage to exist. And so I think you'll see similar 2013 kind of mandates and timelines coming out of Europe, would be my guess.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful. So just bear with me how I ask the question. But the OTC market, the futures market, you kind of have -- certainly in the futures, you have the kind of member layer guarantor in front of the customer. And then in the OTC business, you have some customers coming in, but from a clearing perspective, they still go through a member, correct? So help me understand it. I mean, are you kind of getting to a point now where you are more interested in getting more of a connection directly to end-user clients? Because with Creditex, you've got the dealer-to-dealer flow on the execution side. You bought it for the clearing and then the changing market structure. But is the next phase for ICE to kind of start looking at more the direct dealer-to-client-type execution venues?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","If you really look at what we have technology-wise, our platform -- our ICE trading platform is somewhat unique and that they can be permissioned by us to be a futures-style platform, which is an all-to-all platform that does not rely on dealers or market makers per se. We have the ability to create dealer-to-client in more traditional OTC-type role where the dealer is the market maker and the client is price taker. And we have the ability to go dealer-to-dealer, where it's basically a wholesale market. And so we have never necessarily biased ourselves on how the market should evolve. We've simply tried to create technology that serves whatever the market needs are. And then what's happening specifically in the case of energy swaps -- and as I mentioned, this is not -- this is something that we suspected was going to happen. So we've been preparing for, for the last couple of years is that as the rules unfolded, the customers really looked at -- and they have enough visibility in the Dodd-Frank rules right now even though they're not finalized, but that the key ones are, and they have said, you know what, I'd rather trade these as futures. What does that mean? It means, I'm willing to put my trades on a real-time ticker, not have them delayed 15 minutes or whatever in terms of what goes into a swaps data repository. I'm willing to have my trades be highly standardized in the sense that they could be listed on a central limit order book. And I'm willing to provide both -- provide liquidity and take liquidity, and be a price maker and a price taker. I mean, there are people that have said it is incumbent on us as an industry to make sure that these markets stay liquid and transparent in order for this conversion to happen. So energy is a bit unique, but I do think the other markets are, where possible, will seek to operate with the lowest capital and the lowest friction. That's just sort of a natural phenomenon. And so we are well-positioned with this technology footprint as these other markets transition. And that's why Scott spoke somewhat confidently about our views in the credit to full swaps market. But it's they're -- all of these markets are on a different trajectory and operating under different timetables. And we want to be in the workflow as much as we can.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Leon from S&P Capital IQ.","Kenneth M. Leon - S&P Equity Research","Jeff, question in terms of international growth. Do you mostly see the organically growing products or leveraging your technology platform to new partners despite your large capital? I mean, is this the way you're really going to grow? And does that provide enough upside for you given that there aren't a lot of London Metal Exchange companies out there for you?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","It's a good question. We are not in the technology business, per se. We do not, unlike a lot of exchanges, have an active, broad goal of licensing our technology. But where -- we have license, too, and we do where we feel like we're at a disadvantage and through a strong partner, we could accelerate growth in an emerging area faster than being on our own. So our licenses and our partnerships are highly strategic. Our business has done well financially for our shareholders, while we completely drive the businesses, have solutions for the customers, we are very aware of the needs of serving our shareholders. So we tend to want to do business against our current model, which is to try to keep costs fixed and have a growing volumes that have variable pricing. And so where we do license or JV or enter new markets with others, we're highly aware that, that is the driver of growth for us. That -- and in so in that way, we're a bit different than a typical technology licensor, if you will. And I would just -- I agreed there are not many London Metal Exchanges. The London Metal exchange is, I don't know, 200 years old, 150 years old. I mean, it's an unbelievable franchise. It was a member organization that had to -- had resisted becoming part of a larger exchange group for a long period of time. And you're right, there are not many London Metal Exchanges. But we have tended to do deals that people don't expect us to do. We don't really do deals where we are part of an auction, and it is simply who can pay the most or who wants to pay the most for an asset. Our deals that have really driven a lot of value have been the deals that have -- we've created. They've moved us outside of our current comfort level, and they have not been obvious. And I know that may sound odd, but at the time we did the deals that we did, none of the things that we did particularly seemed very obvious to people.","Kenneth M. Leon - S&P Equity Research","And finally, as an organization, you're very focused, very successful in executing with your management team. A wide number of opportunities and challenges, which have been on this call today, and the question is, do you feel that maybe, you need to expand the management team even before you secure other new businesses, just because this is the way that you're going to stay ahead of the curve?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","That's a good question. And because I'm the founder the company and because I'm very public in terms of wanting to meet with shareholders and analysts a lot and an outward face for the company, I think oftentimes people don't recognize how deep the management team is here. The reason I can do that and be public and talk a lot as an outside voice is because it's just the opposite. It's because we have such a strong management team, and they give me the opportunity to be outward. Chuck Vice, who is -- sits next to me on all these calls and is our present Chief Operating Officer, has been driving a lot of our execution. And recently, we acknowledged a number of our younger executives and promoted them. And that was very intentional on the part of Chuck and I to both acknowledge their contribution and to continue to keep the upward momentum for this next tier of executives so that they stay attached to the company, because they are our ultimate future. And so I hope that the -- that I'm not getting in the way of the visibility into the strength of this team. It's because of the strong team that the company has done so well. And they afford me the luxury of standing in front of them and being the mouthpiece for them. So no, we don't need more executives. In fact, we have an unbelievably deep bench. And the other last point I would make to use, we drive this company as a management team. I don't think that, necessarily, people aware of it, that there's a strong contribution by all of the people on our management committee, which I think now numbers around 18 or so, in driving the business across geographies and asset classes and technology and what-have-yous. It is a very, very collaborative effort, but it takes decisions and moves quickly and that backs each other up. So we have an unbelievable chemistry that's been going on here. One last thing, if you'll let me just pontificate a little bit, we have been preparing this company for regulatory change in the form of Dodd-Frank and, ultimately, EMIR. We've been preparing this company for an increased flow of business in the clearinghouses. There has been a huge investment of energy and time and evolution of what goes on inside this company to prepare for that. And so we've been able to make that investment for relatively modest capital, but, nonetheless, you should not underestimate how well-prepared we are for what we think is a heavily-evolving financial services business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Harris from Wells Fargo securities.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a quick follow-up question on the grains business. Jeff, you mentioned a pretty strong start to that business, exceeding your expectations. Wondering if you could maybe share with us who the earlier customers or adopters are in that business. Are these hedgers, or are they more the outgo traders that like to maybe trade off CIMI's platform? And then assuming continued success there, might we see you extend this strategy into maybe other non-obvious asset classes, like metals comes to mind, for instance?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, interesting. This is a customer-driven product launch. The ags are a customer-driven product launch. And the customers that we refer to are the hedgers that wanted some alternatives in the space and wanted competition, and we're willing to bifurcate liquidity to create another natural competitor. I think that we can grow these markets with algorithmic traders and other nontraditional market participants, because we've shown ourselves in other markets that if we can attract the ultimate hedge -- hedge or end-user that you've got natural flow that -- and it becomes easy to attract other users. We're going to be very -- we're very cautious in who we attract our markets and how because we want to make sure that, that volume growth is for the benefit of that end-user customer as a rule of our business. But that's why I'm surprised and feel good about -- personally surprised and feel good about that particular that product launch. And I do think that we continue to dialogue with the commodities trade, and they are really going through a lot of changes because of global regulation because of the emergence of business in Asia and Brazil and other places. There's just an unbelievable amount of change happening at the commodity end-user level. So there is a host of opportunity. Scott keeps referring to this opportunity set in relation to our capital, but we truly believe that there are fundamental changes going on in the way of business is being conducted, and that we are very well-positioned and are being opportunistic around those changes.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's great, Jeff. Just a quick follow-up for Scott really quick, if I could. I know a lot of questions on the capital return. Just one other for you. Along the lines of seeing kind of an increase in cash balance here, we've also seen your debt go up by quite a lot over the last on the couple quarters. And I know you paid down a little bit this quarter. Any strategic rationale why you have an increasing debt balance along with the cash? I mean, I presume some of that in the fourth quarter of last year was you maybe you wanted to prepare for LME, but now that that's kind of not really an opportunity for you anymore, might we see you perhaps aggressively pay down the debt a little bit more?","Scott A. Hill","Yes. I'm not sure what you're looking at. The debt level's actually been coming down a lot 3 quarters. We did take on a little bit of debt when we made the Cetip share acquisition a little over a year ago. I feel pretty good about the debt structure we've got. And our leverage is below 1. The term on our debt is, I think, around 5 or 6 years. And the absolute cost of our debt is below 4%. So I think if you lay that up against anybody in the space, nobody's got the maturity of debt that we've got at the interest rate that we have. And I'm not aware that anybody's got leverage much below where we are. So I think it's a very low leverage, very efficient structure that we've got in place. And in terms of paying it down more aggressively, in a world where we're not paying much on the debt, I don't feel completely compelled to go and do that. It's an alternative, if not, one of the more attractive ones.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gaston Ceron from MorningStar equity.","Gaston  F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just have 2 very quick questions. One is, just going back to the grains for a second. I know it's been a big topic conversation since the launch. And I know it's still early days, as you said. But curious if you expand your range a little bit, what do you see as kind of the long-term potential for that segment? We've got this -- as we all know, we've got this drought here in the U.S. and there are experts that think that events like this that have become more and more common going forward, which you would think would increase the opportunities or the need, rather, for hedging and other trading activity around that segment. So curious to know what your long-term sort of growth outlook is for that segment. And lastly, on the market data fees. Seems like they saw a nice increase again this quarter. Curious to know what's going on there.","Scott A. Hill","I'll take both those in order. So just with regards to droughts and things that affect the agricultural contracts, I don't know to what extent that's going to continue. But we do believe that the contracts that we offer in the agricultural space give commercial customers the opportunity to hedge against those risks. Depending on what those risks are, though, it does materially impact what we see in volumes. So, for example, cotton was extremely volatile a year ago, but the drought wiped most of the crops out. So there were a lot of commercial customers hedging crops that didn't exist, and so volumes were impacted. As we've gotten into a better growing season this year, and some of the droughts have abated in the key cotton-growing areas, in a volatile environment, you saw cotton volumes grow 31% year-over-year. So I think some of the dynamics that you talked about have always played a part in what we see in volumes, and will always continue to play a part. And your reference to the grains, again, we heard from customers that they wanted us to launch those contracts to provide them with an opportunity to more efficiently hedge their risks. To the extent that there is customer demand to do that in those contracts or in other contracts, we're certainly going to listen to that demand and react to it. With regards to market data, as I said in our prepared remarks, that for me has always been a very good leading indicator of interest in our markets and where are growth opportunity is. So when I say that we're optimistic about our forward growth prospects, a lot of it is the investment opportunities that Jeff talked about and the regulatory uncertainty, which opens up opportunities. But it's also confidence in our core business. That market data revenue growth, I believe, is reflective of people being interested in seeing our data. And Jeff had a chart that he spoke to in the presentation that shows the increase of customers that we're seeing. And what we see is we'll see people that want the data first and then once they've seen the data start to trade. And then that's combined with the fact that we have had an opportunity because of the growth in demand to adjust our pricing in the market data space. And we do that in a very careful manner, but that's another reason why you've seen our data business grow significantly, over 20% in the quarter year-over-year and pretty consistently, quarter after quarter.","Operator","Our final question comes from Brian Bedell from ISI Group.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just another follow-up on the OTC conversion to futures and the energy complex. Obviously, the trading velocity tends to increase pretty significantly on futures versus over-the-counter contracts. How should we think about how you're factoring that in your pricing of the futures contracts? I guess, in other words, do you think the trading velocity can increase a lot, and should that be upside to the current revenue stream in OTC energy?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","That's a good question. And first of all, we're not making any changes to our pricing. And maybe second of all and less obvious is we are very cautious in the way we introduce algorithms to our markets, and we have not really tried to drive volume through algorithmic trading, per se. I made that comment in our prepared remarks. We've really been trying to create a holistic environment, where there's enough liquidity for people to get business done and for algorithms to make money, but up what for end-user  hedgers to have a good trading experience. So we balance that. But I do -- all that being said, we're making no changes to our pricing or our philosophies as we go forward. The -- there is an overall, however, in Dodd-Frank that more trades are going to be done across electronic transparent screens, and we think that there will be more trades done on futures platform. Underneath the details of Dodd-Frank, the OTC brokers community has higher standards that -- if they are going to continue to trade OTC. And so our broker partners in the OTC space are getting certified. They're taking Series 7 tests. They're registering with the NFA in many cases. And so they are, for all intents and purposes, taking the steps to become futures brokers. And so we think that the community itself will look a lot like the way it looks today, and everybody with heightened standards and with more business being traded electronically, as it is being mandated to do so by Dodd-Frank.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful. And then just lastly on just the volume trends, just very -- in very late July, obviously, they were very strong in the first half on the energy side. But if you can give us a sense of maybe we'll get a little bounce back on the OTC. I know, $1.4 million today, and July was trending down from last quarter. Where do you think we're going to get a little bit of a snap back as we move through the third quarter there? And do you think the London Olympics at all are impacting volumes on the ICE energy futures set?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Those are good questions. We -- July, we had a Fourth of July in the U.S. that was in the middle of the week. That sort of the lent itself so a lot people taking the week off. And now, we have basically a 2-week period where a lot our colleagues in London are not at their desks, have chosen to leave town, so July is normally, seasonally slow. And this particular July, I'm not foreshadowing anything. I'm just saying this particular July, you do have these kind of unique timetables that are going on. But more broadly, as we go into the third and fourth quarter, we expect the U.S. gas and power OTC customers are going to be thinking about Dodd-Frank in earnest and their compliance with Dodd-Frank. We hope that our transparency on the convertibility of OTC to futures will keep people active in the OTC markets during that transition period. That's partly why we've come out with a statement now, and given a lot of foreshadowing in what we're going to do. We thought it was best to actually make that transition in January so that we can get people through what will be busy November and December holiday seasons, as well as a lot of pressure on people to comply with Dodd-Frank. So we didn't want to be one more thing to have to deal with. Also, getting that election in the New Year will allow people who hedge to make proper tax selections, which companies tend to do early in the New Year under U.S. tax law. So all that being said, it's hard to predict how the OTC markets will respond into the early days of implementation of Dodd-Frank. We know there will be more clearing coming. And so how that all shakes out, yet to be seen. We feel good about the way we position the company, however, as a regulatory roadmap for people to do business, and that's certainly how we're going to be marketing ourselves to our customers so that they can have confidence and compliance at the same time.","Operator","And that concludes today's Q&A session. I will now hand the call back to management for closing remarks.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, again, I'd like to thank everybody for joining us today.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce your host, Ms. Kelly Loeffler. You may begin, ma'am.","Kelly L. Loeffler","Good morning, ICE's 2013 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors' section of our website at theice.com. These items will be archived, and our call will be available for replay.","Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the company's Form 10-K.

Hill","Thanks, Kelly. Good morning, and thank you, all, for joining us today. I'll start this morning by providing some detail on our first quarter results, and then hand the call over to Jeff, who will review our strategic initiatives.  We'll try and get through our prepared remarks quickly so that we can move on to Q&A, and then wrap up prior to the market opening.","So let's get started on Slide 5. We made significant progress on key initiatives across M&A, new products and clearing, while maintaining a disciplined approach to spending during the first quarter, thus, despite low energy market volatility during the quarter and against a tough comparison from the prior year, we were able to deliver modest earnings growth.","And importantly, our first quarter performance and continued strength in April volume has us on track to achieve our full year objectives. Disciplined expense management is a fundamental part of the ICE culture. However, our primary focus is on growth and innovation to serve our customers and to deliver value to our shareholders. Whether through the expansion of Brent market share, adding new customers or the introduction of new products and services, we remain focused on capturing market opportunity.","Volume and open interest records were set in several energy contracts during the quarter, despite the relative lack of market volatility. Our oil and ag complexes each performed very well in the first quarter and into April.  We also completed the ICE Endex transaction, supported the launch of Cetip's fixed income platform and, of course, advancing our work on completing that NYSE Euronext acquisition.  So all in all, a good start to an exciting year.","Let's move to Slide 6 for a more detailed snapshot of the quarter. Revenues declined 4% to $352 million on a 4% decline in average daily volumes. Our disciplined approach to spending and investment resulted in a 6% decline in adjusted operating expenses, which exclude duplicate rent expense and acquisition expenses relating to NYSE Euronext and ICE Endex.","Adjusted operating margin increased to 63%. Our tax rate was in line with our guidance at 28%, and adjusted net income attributable to ICE grew to $149 million.  Adjusted diluted earnings per share also increased 1% to $2.03. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $150 million, and technology-related capital expenditures and capitalized software were $14 million for the quarter.  We also invested $11 million to build out our new combined New York office, which our teams will move into later this month.","Turning to Slide 7, I'll walk through the components of our first quarter consolidated revenue and expenses.  Transaction and clearing revenue declined 7% to $300 million, primarily driven by low volatility and volume in our North American natural gas market. Transaction revenue in the financial category also declined as markets for credit derivatives and equity indexes remained lackluster. However, agriculture futures revenue increased a solid 6% from the prior first quarter, and Brent Crude revenues grew 14% from the prior first quarter.","Market data revenues also grew 12% to a record $41 million. The credit derivative execution business remains pressured due to the uncertainty of financial reform, as well as a general lack of volatility in the corporate credit market. However, with the advent of mandatory clearing on March 11, we're starting to see increased clearing activity. We continue to develop solutions for credit market to support our customers, as they comply with financial reform, while ensuring that expenses and investments are prudent.","Moving to the right side of Slide 7. You can see the details of our operating expenses. The 6% reduction in adjusted operating expenses reflects improvement across compensation, professional services, tech and communications and SG&A. This expense improvement enabled adjusted operating margins to expand by 1 point to 63%.","Importantly, consistent with prior guidance, we continue to expect 2013 adjusted operating expenses to increase in the range of 3% to 5% compared to 2012's adjusted operating expenses. Combined with the volume and OI trends through April, we're confident that we can deliver double-digit adjusted earnings growth for the full year 2013.","Now please to turn to Slide 8, where I'll discuss the first quarter performance of our futures market. Futures revenue declined 5% over the prior first quarter on a 4% decline in average daily volumes. You can see though that most product categories grew at a healthy rate during the quarter, with many turning in their first or second best quarter ever. And revenue captured trends remain positive across all of ICE's future asset class. However, the muted trading environment in natural gas resulted in a decline in futures overall. Specifically, North American natural gas average daily volume declined 28% compared to 2012's first quarter, where strong volatility drove average daily volumes to record levels.","I also want to point out the mix shift within the power market from full-sized to small-sized power contract, which now comprise 96% of contract volume. This means that the product mix has largely shifted to smaller, lower-priced contracts.","It's important to note, however, that the futures markets began to rebound with 17% average daily volume growth in March. And that recovery continued in April, where average daily volumes grew across agriculture and energy market, with ag markets up slightly and energy futures up around 20%. Energy growth was driven by over 30% growth in Brent Crude and around 8% in North American natural gas volume, which are experiencing more typical levels of volatility. We'll provide more details in our volume press release tomorrow.","Turning to Slide 9, I'll discuss our credit derivatives operation. First quarter CDS revenues were $33 million. This includes roughly $18 million from Creditex, and approximately $16 million from CDS clearing. Through April 26, we have cleared $40 trillion in gross notional, and we continue to expand our lead in both dealer and client clearing. We have cleared nearly 15x more buy side activity than our nearest competitor since mandatory clearing began on March 11, and that activity is contributing to our bottom line.","Also during the quarter, we announced the approval of portfolio margining for our client customers and are working with the SEC to provide the full economic cost-margining benefit to ensure the aims and requirement of clearing are met.","We're also working with regulators to launch Western European sovereign CDS and to deliver a client clearing solution in London. And, in addition, we plan to launch our credit index future in June. This, when issued, futures product will be based on the next index series and avoid adjusted default risk inherent in the existing CDS swap product. We believe the product will provide company, banks and portfolio managers with an innovative, simple and efficient means of managing credit risk, just as equity index futures have enabled the management of equity market risk for decades.","As we launch those initiatives and continue to expand the set of products to be cleared, and as we work with our customers to prepare for the second wave of mandatory clearing in June, we're optimistic about the contributions from this business, despite the uncertainty and muted trading levels in the broader CDS market.","I'll wrap up my remarks on Slide 10. For the quarter, we generated $150 million of operating cash flow and held $1.4 billion in cash. We have access to $2 billion under our existing credit facility, including $1.7 billion available for general corporate purposes and $303 million available to our clearing houses. And we have a strong balance sheet, low leverage and are generating industry-leading 18% returns on invested capital.","Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I'd like to note that our progress with the buildout of clearing service for NYSE Liffe's U.K. derivatives business is on track. We're pleased with the progress and continue to work closely with customers and regulators to achieve an on-time transition this summer.","And I'll summarize all of my comments by reiterating that first quarter results were in line with our expectations and position us well to deliver on our 2013 objectives. We have an excellent position across the energy, agricultural and financial markets we serve. We are facilitating our customers compliance with reform, and we're investing in long-term growth initiatives that will allow us to continue our sector leadership, while delivering value to our shareholders.","With that, I encourage you to review the guidance in the press release, and I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. Jeff, over to you.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, to everybody on the call. The ICE team is well into executing on our 2013 plans, and we remain on track to deliver on our objectives. We have had much to look forward to this year, and our team is advancing many initiatives that will strengthen our leadership in growth, innovation and customer service.  In fact, our culture thrives on solving the next challenge on behalf of our customers. Change will continue in this industry, and we remain well positioned at the forefront of anticipating and serving the needs of our markets.","This morning, I'll provide an update on our initiatives before the Q&A session. And I'll begin where Scott left off, on the topic of our NYSE Euronext transaction on Slide 11 and a view of our combined business based on 2012 performance.","As we continue with our transaction planning, we're confident that our companies will unlock significant value by delivering on our growth and synergy expectations. Because our customers continue to face tremendous regulatory change and uncertainty, the availability of risk management tools that enable compliance with hundreds of new rules is critical.","Because change will be a constant in our industry for some time to come, we believe our combination brings the experience, the assets and the leadership required to execute on a growth agenda and support the evolution of markets. From regulated transparent markets to clearing across all major asset classes, along with data and technology, we will continue to access new opportunities across the globe, while strengthening our existing business.","On Slide 12, the timeline we put together shows the dual track of the competition approval process and the general operational and regulatory steps required to close the transaction.  We continue to believe the deal will be finalized in the third or fourth quarter of this year, subject to completion of all requirements and approvals. On the competition approval side, we've completed the U.S. process with the Department of Justice under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, and we're now focused on the European requirements.","Last week, the merger was referred to competition review of the European Commission from authorities in the United Kingdom, Portugal and Spain. Therefore, we're now completing our notification to the commission on Form CO, which will serve as the basis for the competition review. Upon receipt of this notification, authorities will begin a 25-business-day review under Phase 1 of the process. It's an in-depth investigation. When the merger is open, it will start a minimum 90-day clock in Phase 2. However, these timelines are subject to extension based on circumstance, so we can't guarantee specific deadlines.  We will continue to work with regulators to ensure that we're responsive to all their requests and do so in a timely manner.","Our Form S-4 filed with the SEC has been declared effective by the SEC as of Tuesday. And we've received approval on our European prospectus as of today. We appreciate the excellent progress by our respective teams in achieving these milestones.","Both ICE and NYSE Euronext have established June 3 as the special meeting day for approving the transaction. We have an ongoing dialogue regarding the IPO of Euronext, which we continue to expect, following the closing of our deal. But we have not yet established a specific timeline. The approval and integration process for this transaction is extensive, but we're working to ensure a timely and transparent process. We'll continue to keep you apprised of key milestones and other developments as we have more information. But we're pleased with the progress so far and our focus on opportunities to build, grow and lead globally as one company.","Before I turn to the core business, I'll briefly update you on the regulatory environment as it relates to ICE.  As we move into the fifth year of regulatory reform, the focus on operational certainty and the impact to end users is key. Our transitioned energy futures for natural gas, power and oil products have enabled risk management to continue seamlessly. And this has not changed any margin requirements relative to their former less-regulated status.  More importantly, the move provided certainty to end users, and it supported greater transparency and more regulation than was applied in the swaps market.","Uncertainty remains for U.S. swaps on additional requirements for swap execution facilities for clearing and on other final rules. I'll note that this uncertainty has caused us to pause our work on the clearing for non-deliverable forward FX contracts, but we'll continue to monitor regulatory developments to evaluate next steps as rules are finalized, hopefully, later this year.","Further change will inevitably be driven by Europe's work on financial reform in the coming year. We're monitoring developments globally across MiFID, EMIR, Basel III and IOSCO, as well as how Asia is responding to the regulatory environment. We believe the focus of regulators will then shift to ensure international cooperation and the reduction of regulatory arbitrage opportunities. We've successfully launched our U.S. swaps data repository for commodity swaps and credit derivatives, and we're building a European FDR for both futures and swaps market, which is required under EMIR.","Scott mentioned our progress with CDS clearing at $40 trillion now cleared, and that we have extended our leadership in buy side clearance. We have tremendous infrastructure from clearing to processing in the swaps market with ICE Clear Credit and ICE Link, and we believe that this expertise will support our work on additional swap-clearing opportunities.","Turning to an update on our markets on Slide 13. You can see that energy volumes remain a bright spot in global markets. Total average daily volume in Brent increased 17% in the first quarter, and Brent open interest was up 39% year-to-year. Average daily volume and open interest in other oil products increased 20% and 58%, respectively, year-to-year.  In both March and April, ICE Brent outtraded combined ICE and CME WTI futures volumes for the first time ever, despite a narrowing of the Brent WTI spread to its lowest level in many, many months.","Moving on to natural gas markets. I want to highlight the completion of the ICE Endex transaction in March, where we acquired an 80% stake in the exchange. This is a newly formed company, which incorporates the natural gas futures and spot market of the former APX-ENDEX business. We believe that this transaction will serve as a catalyst for ICE's further expansion into Continental European natural gas and power markets. The Amsterdam-based exchange is best known for its such natural gas futures contract, known as the TTF gas market. But it also operates key spot markets for gas in Continental Europe and the U.K.","We believe there's significant potential for global natural gas markets to become more liquid and transparent, while operating on a more connected basis. We have a unique infrastructure and strong experience in natural gas and power markets, and we look forward to building this business out on a larger scale.","Turning to North American natural gas markets. We've seen recent strengthening in volume trends. While first quarter average daily volume declined 28%, in part due to the high water mark per volume established in last year's first quarter, average daily volume grew year-on-year in both March and April. And while last year's January and February remain our toughest comparisons, this year's upward trend in natural gas prices from around $3.30 to more than $4.30 for longer data contracts demonstrate how price volatility makes hedging a necessary component of managing risks at all gas price levels.","In the month of March, we had 9 open interest record in our -- in rehab contract, followed by 11 open interest records in April. With temperatures and inventory lower than expected in recent months, these shoulder months have been more active than in the last few years.","Longer term, our position in the market is very strong, particularly as the U.S. continues to invest in more ways to become a natural gas-driven economy. With manufacturing and transportation increasingly substituting or switching to natural gas, and as liquid buy [ph] natural gas continues to develop, we believe that it will ultimately become a global market. With the leading electronic platform for trading across North America and the broadest range of energy markets across the U.K. and Continental Europe, we are well positioned as we continue to bring new users and products to market.","On Slide 14, I'll note a few additional areas of ongoing focus. For the seventh consecutive quarter, our European emissions, futures and options volume grew year-on-year, with average daily volume up 34% in the first quarter.  Carbon prices remain very low, but the requirement to manage emissions allowances in Europe, either be it the central market or in the auctioning process, has continued to drive solid trading activity and maintain liquidity.","Our agricultural markets turned in solid performance with the first quarter average daily volume up 8%, and that growth continued into April. In Brazil, we're pleased to note that the launch of our OTC fixed income platform offered through Cetip is now seeing very solid uptake, particularly for a market that had not previously traded electronically.","I'll conclude my prepared remarks on Slide 15, with the areas of focus that we set out at the beginning of this year. We've discussed each of these priorities today, and these are the objectives that we believe will drive growth. We remain on track to achieve our operational and financial objectives, and I want to acknowledge the work of our global team that continues to advance these efforts with a very strong focus on customer service, expense discipline and results.","With a strong core business, a healthy pipeline and growth initiatives and good progress on our acquisition of NYSE Euronext, we remain confident that we will deliver another year of growth, leadership and record results.  On behalf of everyone here at ICE, I'd like to thank all our customers for trusting us with their business last quarter.","I'll now ask our operator, Kevin, to conduct the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Howard Chen with Credit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Jeff, there continues to be this growing disconnect between volume growth in the energy commodity and the financial markets. From where we stand now, how much do you think it's the relative maturity of the 2 trading markets versus the relative health of the 2 end-user bases. And maybe just -- now that you're adding to your financial suite product with this deal and organically too, what do you think we need to see to see an acceleration just generally across financial products?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","It's a good question. It's one that's, obviously, hard to note, so you have to operate a little bit I think, by gut and conversation with customers. But the first part of your question, yes, the energy and commodity markets generally have -- or one of the last markets to move from floor to screen, so they're slightly less mature as an electronically traded and globally distributed asset class. But I think the real underlying issue, and it's the issue that I think you're probably aware that we're interested  in with respect to acquiring NYSE Euronext at this moment in time, is that many financial products are highly correlated to the interest rate environment, and we have a western 0 interest rate environment. And secondly, I do think that there's been a loss of confidence in the equity markets coming out of say, 2007, 2008 downturns that need -- and that confidence needs to be restored. So I hope that as markets become, let's call it, more normalized in terms of rates and confidence, that we will be in a good position to help price growth. And I think we've been very public that we want to do everything we can to help bring back confidence in markets where we can.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And where would you fit the CDS market in that conversation, Jeff?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","I think it's interesting, because I think, it is probably the least mature of all those markets that we've talked about. In the sense that credit is a very, very large market, but people tend to trade credit by trading the underlying product, i.e., corporate and sovereign bonds. And it's very hard to trade those products, because there really isn't a well-established derivative market that surrounds them, like you would see in most other asset classes. And it is the development of that derivative market that has us so intrigued, and it's the reason that we decided to move into that space. And it's the reason we've been working with a very broad group of people in the industry to try to develop a new credit futures product that we intend to launch shortly.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And my follow-up Scott, on expenses, operating expense is really controlled to begin the year, down 6%. But it appears you're holding the line on a 3% to 5% core expense growth for the year. So can you just remind us what are some of those primary drivers that drive that upward swing over the balance of the year?","Scott A. Hill","Yes, I think it's upward swing -- it's a modest upward swing from where we are. But we are going to continue to invest in some small amount of hiring as we go through the course of the year, particularly around our clearing initiatives and our technology initiatives. In addition to that, with all the regulatory churn that continues to go on. I was very pleased with our professional services spending in the first quarter. But I suspect that will be under pressure as we continue to work very closely with a number of law firms on the many regulatory initiatives that are out there. I would expect, however, if you look over the course of the quarters, we were on an adjusted basis of about $1.31 this quarter. I'll expect this to be around $1.35 give or take, over each quarter for the next few quarters. With some of the uptick coming from those items that I just talked about. In addition to that, we talked about closing the index transaction. I suspect that'll add $2 million to $3 million of expense a quarter over the next few quarters. But thankfully, that will be more than offset by the revenues that we'll get from that deal.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rick Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","This isn't a question. But math on your expenses, Scott. If I did it really quickly still puts you up, I think, below the low end or at the very low end. But let me ask...","Scott A. Hill","Around the low end.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, all right. Anyway, so my question is -- first one is on market data. We know you put a screen -- a price increase, and it was also -- this elimination of the trade or pay. And we had sort of estimated a much bigger increase. I was just trying to see whether there's attrition in this trade or pay price increase on the screens and the market data.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Rich, I actually, if you look last year, we averaged around $36 million to $37 million a quarter in market data fees, and we jumped to $41 million this quarter. And I think it is largely attributable to the 2 IMs you mentioned. One of the things that I've always found encouraging about our data business is whether we're making price adjustments, which we've done on a periodic basis, or taking some of the other actions, we don't tend to see attrition. And even more importantly, we continue to see upticks in the number of people who are interested in the data. So again, maybe we can walk through the math to see where you might have been off a little bit. But a $4 million uptick from our average quarter last year, we were pretty pleased with. And I think if you look across the balance of the year, we think it's fixed.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. And then my follow up would be, you spend a lot of time and talked about the credit, still, opportunity.  I guess, my question is what have we -- with the mandatory clearing, at least Phase 1 in March, what have we learned from what's gone on so far? And then, of all the things, there's been some regulatory uncertainty. We know Phase 2 is coming. And we know your futures product is -- which do you think is a -- what have we learned -- what's the catalyst to get a little uptick here.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Rich, I think, we learned a couple of things. The first phase of the mandatory clearing kicked in on March 11. And from March 11 to the end of the month, we cleared over $300 billion in just that short span and earned over $1 million of revenue for doing it. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, since that mandatory clearing, we've cleared 15x more than the net closest competitor. So I think we learned that we are the preferred CDS clearing now. I think we confirmed that as the mandatory clearing kicks in, that we are going to see the buy side move in. And I think we confirmed that there are good economics that dropped to our bottom line from doing that. I think the next catalyst is the June mandatory clearing. And then as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I think we have additional catalyst as we work with the SEC to get the full benefits of portfolio margining, which I think will encourage the buy side to bring in our single names in addition to the mandatory index clearing, and then as we refine our offerings in Europe to bring clients on board there as well. So as I look into the next 8 or 9 months, and frankly, into 2014, I think there's a lot of opportunity in CDS clearing, and I think it's going to materially impact our bottom line. I'm also excited about the CDS Index Futures product that we've talked about. As I mentioned, there's not really a standard, easy, efficient way for people to go, and Jeff just mentioned this in one of his answers, to trade credit. And we think this Index Future's similar to equity index future product that existed for a long time. Our product that will encourage people to take position on the relative credit worthiness of companies and industries, will start with the investment-grade in the high-yield indexes, but I think there's a lot of opportunity down the road beyond just those products. So I think in the first phase, it's about the clearing. But I think longer term, credit will be a tradable market, and we think there are additional products that we can create with our customers that will enable that trading.","Operator","Our next question comes from Niamh Alexander with KBW.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Can you could spend a bit of time on the credit derivative? So if I could touch on maybe the extra territoriality, it seems to be kind of more in the soft market right now that the issue with the U.S. regulators and the European are playing out. But we're starting to hear more about international banks maybe not wanting to do soft U.S. banks, but are you seeing that maybe impact some of the hedging on the futures side yet or any impact there? How did that play out for your business?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Niamh, we have not actually seen it impact our business. But I will tell you it's a source of active conversation by those people that are engaged in the regulatory process. We have seen our attention turned towards eliminating arbitrage internationally and the specific differences in some of the rulemakings, particularly as it relates to Dodd-Frank versus EMIR. The -- where it impacts the futures market is most likely through the futures commission merchants. And there, the way they will have to organize to allow international business at international exchanges to be organized. And that particular group right now is drinking from a fire hose on other issues. And so we have -- there are some FCMs that are engaged in looking globally. But right now, people are just rushing to complete with the deadlines that Rich Repetto just mentioned and other more immediate issues. So as I said in my prepared remarks, I do think attention is going to turn some time later this year towards harmonization of rules, because there will be a complicated infrastructure required to meet all the very specific needs globally. But today, we haven't seen it impact volumes.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And my follow-up, if I could, on sticking with the regulatory changes, many of them. Like I would consider the conversion of the soft futures for you, I mean, it's clearly been a success and now you're kind of thinking rebasing the goals even higher in your energy complex. Help me think about the potential to bring more volume onto screens a bit now that the kind of market's comfortable with, and maybe raising the block limits a little bit, kind of pushing more into the CLOB?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","So we're -- thank you for that question because we're a big proponent of doing exactly that. We think we're well positioned and we have a unique trading platform that bridges the GAAP from OTC to Futures, so we understand those markets quite well. This is all being driven by again, attention on -- by regulators on where they're focused right now, particularly in the U.S., to finish up Dodd-Frank.  It's hard to know where on the priority list attention to brought trade limits dip. It is something being discussed, but whether it rises to a new rulemaking or administrative positioning sooner rather than later is hard to know. And we're in a fortunate position that we have very good clearing infrastructure and the ability to handle blocks and we have relationships with the OTC market, both principles and brokers that allow blocks, but we're very well positioned with the Central Limit Order Book, and actually think that, that would lead to higher velocities of trading -- broadening of the market if we can get it to move there.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","But you need some rule changes? You can't lift it yourself right now?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, we offer both right now. So the market on ICE is determining where to decide. But my point to you is that regulators are looking at fine-tuning the balance between the 2 with the idea of driving more to Central Limit Order Book trading and screen trading because that's frankly, a higher level of regulation that's easier to administer regulatory oversight, and fair and transparent. So -- but whether they start to tweak those rules in the near term or not, it's hard for us to know.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kenneth Worthington with JP Morgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you help us on the intermediate term outlook for gas, in both the U.S. and Europe? In your prepared remarks, you talked about the near-term and we're seeing that, and you highlighted the long-term. But what I was really hoping to hear is how the gas markets evolved in both the U.S. and Europe over the next 2 years, which for investors, is kind of nice investable universe.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, very hard to predict the future, as you know, but we can look at the near-term path. And what we're seeing is that January and February, in the U.S. natural gas markets, which is a big part of our business, was, let's say, relatively soft, although it was being compared to very, very big January and February in 2012. That's comparables. But we've really seen an acceleration of trading in March and April. So knock on wood, it looks like things are going well in those markets. We've seen a lot of velocity increase in the shorter end of the curve, which is, as you probably know, the area that futures exchanges tend to derive most of their trading activity, and so that's been helpful as well. We do think that Europe is looking for a single set of benchmarks, which is really the -- what we're going to try to do in our acquisition of ICE Endex with the TTF contract, which I mentioned in prepared remarks was a Dutch contract. And we hope that, that will become the marker for the continent. We already traded the U.K. natural gas contract, and we're seeing the markets really think about a globalization of natural gas price that's being done through the small amount of liquefied natural gas that is moving around the world now. But increasingly, the U.S. is such an outlier relative to the rest of the world with low-cost natural gas that the market will find a way to take advantage of that, either by moving natural gas through liquefaction or by moving industrial processes to the U.S. to take advantage of these low prices, but thereby, arbitraging by moving jobs and industry. One way or another, we think that traders will be trading the complex with those facts in mind, and so we're pretty locking on 2-year long-term bullish on the natural gas markets because of those macro trends.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","As a follow-up there, is there some element of network effects? You got U.K. gas, you got Dutch gas, I think you've got German gas. Having those different parts, do they work together to be -- does the whole -- is the whole greater more than the sum of the parts? And then because you have U.S. and Europe, is it the same thing? Because you have the U.S. and Europe, do you get to -- are linkages forming, and I guess the linkages formed before LNG? Or do we need to wait until after LNG becomes deliverable in a bigger way to get kind of the network effects of you having the different pieces and connecting them together?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Our company follows, really, our customers and what you see in the energy markets is you have a lot of very large global energy companies and merchant infrastructure providers and financing that is done globally. And so increasingly, those groups are managing a portfolio, and with regulatory reform, are being forced to look at the whole and figure out how they organize and manage global risk and then compartmentalize it for local regulations. And so having a provider like ICE that is also building out solutions for that problem set, we think it's been very, very helpful. It allows some of our larger customers to just standardize around us. As an anecdote, I had a senior executive at a very large firm said to me that with all the change going on right now for the regulatory and international change going on, that they just don't have the internal bandwidth to be able to deal with lots of disparate systems. And so they're having to pick vendors and partners that can provide as many connections as possible so that they can focus on reorganizing themselves, while all this change is going on. It makes it hard for us endorse people with new platforms and systems right now because they just can't get the attention of the larger firms because they just don't have the ability to deal with them. And you do see companies like ICE really having, I think, an advantage in terms of being at the table to have those conversations with our customers.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First off, I just would like to come back to Rich's question on the credit clearing. Scott, if I heard you correctly, the buy side clearing, obviously, seems to be off to a good start. And if my math's right, you're getting like $4 million to $5 million a quarter contribution from buy side or maybe you can just confirm that? But more importantly, how do you think about this June timeline? You mentioned it a little bit, but when you look at the interest rates today, a lot of people are saying, 10x the amount of firms that are coming online versus March, but I think the credit market has compressed a lot. So I think a lot of those guys might already be clearing. So do you have any other data of how many people are coming online in June versus March so how we should be thinking about the ramp up on the second phase here?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Sure. And just to clarify, I think you asked if it was $4 million to $5 million a quarter. That's probably a little bit above what I'm counting on right now. As I said in the call, the month of March, we saw about $1 million, as you get to wave 2 in June, that may tick up. So in the second quarter, maybe it's a little lower than that range as we get into the back half of the year, I think it starts to move towards the range you talked about. I think, Alex, specific to what we're seeing with customers signing up, I do think that there still are a number of clients who are trading the CDS markets that do have CDS positions that will need to be cleared. I expect the next phase to be measured in hundreds of clients. We've seen a number of them already get hooked up, and I suspect, as is typically the case, as we get closer to that June date, I think it's June 10 is the official date. I would suspect we'll see a mad rush for the customers that haven't signed up yet to get hooked up to clear. So again, I think your range may be a little bit optimistic in the second quarter, but as we move into the back half and get past that second wave, I don't think it's unrealistic.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, cool. And then secondly, maybe stay on the whole topic of clearing. I know, Jeff, and maybe Scott as well, we know there's only a limited amount of what you can do and talk about when it comes to the Liffe clearing arrangement and what you can do from there. But I assume that you're already engaging a lot with the clearing members in Europe, and had conversations about what kind of things you can do different. So maybe you can talk about the new opportunity set a little bit more. I think Jeff said in the past that the current providers of interest rate clearing in Europe didn't have the same opportunity set that might be out there. So what kind of things are clients asking you for to do differently and what do think, how quickly you can execute on that?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, it's a good question. You're correct in that we're having a lot of one-on-one conversations with the individual clearing firms and other major market participants in connection with the transition of the Liffe business. That is going very well. We're in the phase of having people work on novation agreements with us to actually contractually novate the positions over. That process is going well, and there is -- I think you may have heard us say before, but almost a sense of relief by the clearing community that they will be going into a known clearing house with a known rulebook and a known risks system, and so to a certain degree, that transition is relatively easy for them. In that regard, people are talking to us about what it means now to have another large clearing multi-asset class clearing infrastructure in London, how we might deploy that both through the U.K. and in the Continental Europe and then how we will further deploy that clearing house around the world. And so I don't have anything to announce, but you're correct in the opportunity to engage that community right now is very, very helpful to us in figuring out long-term clearing plans.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Jeff, maybe on the -- just on the energy and commodity side, it seems a little bit unusual. If we look at your business over the past 2 quarters, things held up okay, I mean, you got some moderation, but they've held up okay, and recently, they picked back up. If you look at like the financial players or the dealers, it looks like the commodity business has been under a little bit more pressure over the past few quarters. I'm just trying to gauge, is it -- some of this, the transition that we're seeing in the markets, is it just different products? You could say on the swap side, there's still a lot of uncertainty in terms of the rules, the regulations so you could see some of that. I'm just trying to get a sense just coincidentally, ended up being in the same time that the energy markets, at least, the areas that you guys are in, shifted into the new product structure. So just wanted to get your thoughts on if you're seeing anything significant in terms of users or habits or changes?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Sure. Well, it's a very interesting time because there's a lot of change going on. And there, on the one hand, there is some rotation of business away from the typical Wall Street banks, as they have been resizing their businesses and re-looking at their proprietary trading. So there are traders and managers that have rotated out of that infrastructure, but we see them rotating -- successful people are rotating into other players or re-establishing themselves somehow, and so that we saw that -- we've seen that trend a number of times in the history of our company, most similarly after the Enron collapse when there was a wholesale change in the way the market did business. So you have that rotation going on, which tends to complicate the ability to predict volume. But at the same time, by organizing ourselves as regulated futures contracts, while they distributed on an electronic platform globally, we've increased the reach of many of our products, and we've been able to address a client base that either by their own charter did not trade in the OTC market or were not able to trade in our OTC markets because we had a requirement when we were OTC that we do not deal with -- that we deal with principals only and no brokers, and that you have to have $100 million in assets to access our platforms. So we have this kind of odd thing going on, but on the one hand, there's some downsizing on Wall Street, but there's a broader distribution and an increased addressable market due to the fact that we're trading regulated futures.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. That make sense. And then just as a follow-up here on the clearing side, just when you're talking to customers, just want to follow-up on that. When you think about what customers are dealing with, whether it's on the technology side, the margin side, the international, like different potential rules, like what are -- if we do face some hurdles as we approach the June deadline, is it most likely on the tech side, meaning, everyone trying to get things in place by that date? Or is there something else that can hold it up or create some hiccups for other clients, like some of their clients that are trying to hit that deadline?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","It seems to us, the biggest neck of the funnel is just people trying to understand their rules and obligations and the extreme pressure that many of the clearing firms are being put under to both onboard these new customers, and at the same time, comply with rules on customer segregation on how much capital is going to be held, and those things firms are forward-looking at, whether they have to position themselves globally and what are the different rules there and how are they treating these new customers. And there's just a lot of conversation going on, and a lot of sort of deer in the headlights activity on behalf of many of the end users. Those end users are slightly more sophisticated that have been paying attention or that we've been able to outreach or the other exchanges or the clearers are getting up to speed. But there's a big group of people that really don't fully understand what these deadlines mean.","Operator","Our next question comes from Roger Freeman with Barclays.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Maybe just picking up on that, I mean, how concerned are you about the June date because it seems that a lot -- there's a lot more of those kinds of market participants in that bucket. I know a number of dealers are concerned about readiness. And then just on the -- it might be related to the CDS business, but the nonconsolidated income or expense rather, was lower this quarter. Was there anything in the CDS business or the Cetip that reduced the income that's going out?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Let me take the first part of the question. I honestly think that at the end of the day, most people respond to deadlines, and the phenomenon of getting ready for a deadline is nothing unique. Every time we've ever launched a new product or a new service or a transition or made a major change and put a deadline out there, we know that the industry largely waits until the end and moves to comply broadly. So I don't think there's anything particularly negative about that. I think if the deadline were moved that people would just wait for the new deadline. So at some point, you've got to draw a line in the sand, and we're just at that crunch time right now. So I'm not concerned about it because I think it is the way human nature works.","Scott A. Hill","I think there was a pretty good article yesterday that talked a little bit about some of the challenges on the U.S. firm, but the products that I need to clear is not cleared by U.S. companies, it's cleared by European company or it's a product that I'm told will be launched, but maybe it's not launched yet or it's a clearing house that's going to launch in June maybe. So there -- in the interest rate space, there does seem to be a lot of confusion. The nice thing about the CDS space is, we've got the clearing firm set up. We've got the full slate of products. It is a U.S. solution. If you're a U.S. customer and got a U.S. SEM, you're in. And if it's European, ultimately, you'll be able to clear in Europe. So I do think there are a lot of challenges, but if you step back and look at the CDS clearing versus other OTC products, I think the path to getting in the clearinghouse is much cleaner. And then Roger, just to follow-up, I think your second question was with regard to the drop-in, in the minority interest in the quarter?","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes.","Scott A. Hill","Yes, and that's just -- the revenues in that business with relatively fixed cost. Cost haven't increased in that business in 3 years, but, rather, news were a little softer in the first quarter than they have in the last couple of quarters, and that caused the profit overall to be down in the quarter, and therefore, the share of that profit that goes out the door is down as well. It's nothing more than that.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, okay. And just Jeff, quickly, your comment on expanding the sort of user base on the energy products that migrated futures last year, can you put any kind of quantitation around that sort of number of customers that have come in since then? Or part of the -- at least broad range in terms of how much volume growth is fueled or is it too early?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","It's too early, and we don't have the metrics to actually look at it that way. But we know from past experience that when people rotate out of jobs, oftentimes, they start their own funds or they day trade from home or what have you, and we can now, in the future space, allow individual investors to have access that we couldn't before. So as people are leaving one job and looking for other, they can actually come in and trade in the interim. So it helps facilitate this rotation that's going on. We know that there's more demand for screens and user IDs and passwords so that the overall trend around the business continues to increase.","Scott A. Hill","But I think the other thing that we know specifically, open interest, you take power out because that's a bit of noise right now. But from the end of the year, our energy open interest is up 12%, excluding power, on a year-over-year basis. Our oil open interest is up 47%. If you look at gas, it's down a little bit year-over-year in the first quarter, but if you look over the last 2 years or go back to first quarter of '11 compared to where we are today, it's up almost 70%. So it's pretty clear that there are a lot of people that are participating in this market and there's a lot of open interest. So that's why as we see volatility, as we did in April, volumes go up. We're looking, right now, at early -- the accountants having to start to close the books yet, but it looks like April is going to be the best revenue months we've ever had.","Operator","Our last question comes from Brian Bedell with ISI Group.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just following on that, maybe a question for Jeff on through the near to intermediate term outlook for Brent. Given the comments you've made about volatility, obviously, we've seen the price of crude come down a bit. There's been some speculation that, that would dampen volumes, but obviously, it's been -- continue to be strong, as you alluded to, with open interest building. If you want to -- can you give us a comment on just trends, say, into the summer in terms of what you're seeing from hedging needs from your customers, and also in context of the Seaway pipeline, the upcoming Keystone pipeline around into Cushing for the WTI contract?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Sure, well, I mean, Brent continues to sort of strength -- get strength. We have a couple of trends that are quite favorable towards Brent. One is that we continue to build out a Brent options market, where there was none a few years ago. Now there's an active Brent options market and options, as an asset class, broadly continues to grow. So people that trade Brent tend to hedge, and people that, excuse me, trade Brent options tend to hedge so it drives underlying volume, and obviously, the option expires under the underline, so some people take expiration, all of which helps the Brent complex. We can give you C-people indexing towards Brent, as you know. And then lastly, as the Brent and WTI spreads come back into what's called more normal conditions as these pipelines and others will lead the issues around Cushing, Oklahoma, people can now go back to trade the Brent WTI spread again, which was a trade that was broken by the dislocation between the 2, but now, they come back in. That is a way that people manage risk, geographic risk, and so as that spread becomes more predictable, I would expect we're going to see more trade there, which obviously, we have the Brent leg and a WTI leg in those.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","All right. So continued strength, okay. And then just my follow-up will be just on the timing of the submission of the Form CO and if it -- I guess, if we stay in Phase 1, it looks like the deal could potentially close by the end of the third quarter and if we slip into phase 2, is it still your sense that it would close by the end of the fourth quarter?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","So we have had informal dialogue with the European commission, the DG comp antitrust regulators. They're going on for some time so that we have a very good view on the areas that they have interest in and can target those when we do turn in the official form. So we have not been sitting on our hands with the European regulator. We're very pleased and thankful that the individual countries agreed to turn the matter over to the Brussels regulators so that -- who have obviously deep knowledge of NYSE Euronext from their past work on the prior deal. You're right in thinking about how we're looking at it. The reason we say it'll close in the back half of the year is we have not started the official process with the antitrust regulator in Europe. And as soon as we turn in that application, it starts this clock and it's conceivable, I guess, that we could get a 25-day review and it's conceivable that they may want to take a look at certain areas and go into the 90-day or longer review. So helping to narrow the differences right now is something that we're doing in the background in the hope that we can provide an opportunity for the regulators to have a relatively clean and easy approval process.","Operator","I would now like to turn the conference back over to our host for closing remarks.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, thanks, all, for joining us today. We look forward to hearing from you throughout the quarter, as you know, and we'll continue to update you on our progress. I want to wish everybody a happy May day, and thank you for joining us today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation.

[Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Warren Gardiner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Warren Gardiner","Good morning. ICE's third quarter 2019 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2018 Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC. In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including adjusted income, EPS, operating income, operating margin, expenses, effective tax rate, free cash flow and adjusted debt to EBITDA. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. To find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP term in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful as well as how management uses these measures in our 10-Q. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses, and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain terms.","With us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Ben Jackson, our President. I'll now turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Hill","Thanks, Warren. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our record third quarter results. Third quarter revenues grew 11% versus last year to a record $1.3 billion. Adjusted operating margins expanded 2 points to 59%, resulting in a record adjusted operating income, which grew 16%. This strong performance generated record adjusted earnings per share of $1.06, an increase of 25% over last year's third quarter and the best quarter in our company's history. Strong growth in our trading and clearing revenues was driven by 19% growth in energy and 23% constant currency growth in financials. Record data and listings revenues included data revenues of $553 million, which were up 5% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted operating expenses totaled $551 million, including a onetime benefit of roughly $6 million within SG&A. Expenses would otherwise have been right in the middle of our guidance.","Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $562 million to $572 million. This improves our full year 2019 expense guidance to a range of $2.18 billion to $2.19 billion. Importantly, though, as you think about our pro forma 2019, you'll need to add to that around $50 million to reflect a full year impact of Simplifile, the licensing reclass that started in the second quarter and the onetime items we've mentioned through the first three quarters.","I also want to provide some color on our third quarter adjusted tax rate of 17.5% and the positive implications for 2020. Based upon additional guidance published in March related to the foreign derived intangible income, or FDII, aspect of the 2017 U.S. Federal Tax Reform, we were able to refine our 2018 return assumptions, which we just filed this month and our 2019 provision. These prior year and year-to-date true-ups are reflected in the low rate in 3Q, and the refined assumptions are expected to contribute to an adjusted tax rate of around 22.5% in the fourth quarter. More importantly, we expect these changes, combined with a scheduled U.K. tax reduction in April of next year, to lower our 2020 tax range by roughly 100 basis points to a range of 21.5% to 23.5%.","Moving to capital return, through the first nine months of 2019, we've generated free cash flow of over $1.7 billion. We've returned over 90% of that cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, including $340 million of buybacks during the third quarter. We continue to expect capital return to grow as we grow, balanced against the need for incremental investments or M&A.","Turning to Slide 5. I'll discuss our Trading and Clearing segment. Revenues of $669 million were up 20% year-over-year in the third quarter. Adjusted operating margins expanded by 2 points to 65%, helping to drive a 24% increase in adjusted operating income. In our Energy business, third quarter revenues increased 19% year-over-year, marking the best quarter ever for our Energy revenues. ADV across our oil complex increased 15% year-over-year, led by 15% growth in Brent and 24% growth in our other crude and refined oil complex.","Our European natural gas business also continues to deliver strong growth, including record third quarter ADV, up 63% and year-to-date volumes, which have grown nearly 50%. In addition, open interest in October across our Energy business is up 8% since the end of last year, led by recent OI records in our Brent crude, North American basis market and TTF natural gas futures. In our Financial Futures business, revenues increased 23% versus last year adjusted for FX. Volatility related to Brexit, as well as uncertainty around the direction of global interest rates, drove strong volumes in Euribor and Sterling product with ADV of 18% and 11%, respectively. Similarly, ADV across our equity index business increased 19% year-over-year. Higher levels of volatility and increased adoption combined to deliver 24% growth in our MSCI ADV compared to the prior year. As we closed out October, open interest in our financial futures business is up 26% from the end of last year, with October registering record levels of sterling open interest, which is up 64% from the end of 2018.","In fixed income and credit, revenues totaled $101 million for the quarter, including $35 million of revenue from our CDS clearing business, which was up 8% year-over-year and reflected record levels of buy side clearing activity.","Moving to Slide 6, I'll discuss our Data and Listings segment. Third quarter revenues totaled a record $667 million, with adjusted operating margins increasing to 52%. In our listings business, the NYSE listed 18 IPOs during the third quarter and has listed 46 IPOs year-to-date, helping our customers raise over $26 billion in proceeds. In addition, our innovative direct listing offering continues to attract interest. The NYSE's hybrid model uniquely combines the human judgment of our direct market makers, with the state of the art technology, to reduce frictions that exist in today's IPO process.","Shifting to data services. Revenues totaled $553 million, an increase of 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Revenue growth in pricing and analytics improved sequentially to 5% on a constant currency basis in the third quarter, driven by solid results across our pricing and reference data business as well as our suite of index products. We expect pricing and analytics revenue and growth to improve sequentially again in the fourth quarter as the secular shift towards workflow automation and fixed income market and from active to passive product continues. In exchange data and feeds, revenues grew 3%. Slower growth at NYSE was mitigated by 6% growth in our futures business, which continues to benefit from strong commercial interest in our global commodities platform.","In desktops and connectivity, revenues grew 10% on a constant currency basis, with performance driven by a sequential improvement in Ice Global Network revenue, reflecting a strong quarter of implementation. We expect connectivity growth to continue to be supported by demand for cyber secure connectivity and vendor optimization, but quarter-to-quarter results will continue to vary based on the timing of customer implementations. Finally, we expect fourth quarter data services revenue to be in the range of $555 million to $560 million, and thus, for the full year, our data revenues will be right around the middle of the guidance we provided when we entered the year.","Our focus remains on serving our customers and delivering value to our shareholders. The efficacy of our diverse business model is once again reflected in open interest growth across our trading and clearing business, complemented by continued and compounding growth in our data business. Through the first nine months of 2019, we generated record revenues, record adjusted operating income and record adjusted earnings per share. And even as we have continued to strategically invest in our future, we have also returned a record $1.6 billion to shareholders. I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll turn it over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Sprecher","Thank you, Scott, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'll begin on Slide 7. Since our inception, we pursued growth opportunities that leverage our leading technology and operational expertise. It's an approach that's guided our evolution into a number of adjacent markets and one that has positioned us today as one of the most diverse market infrastructure companies in the world, operating markets across major asset classes and geographies while serving an array of customer and industry participant needs. Our experience in building trading, clearing and settlement infrastructure informs us of the importance of analytics, indices, payments and valuation services. These are solutions that drive efficiencies, not proceeds that decline with our customers' headcounts. We made our first investments in these areas well over a decade ago, and we continue to build on that foundation, helping to facilitate workflow automation, enhancing pretrade decision-making and improving market transparency.","Our third quarter performance demonstrated the value of such investments. Trading and clearing revenues grew 20% year-over-year, while recurring revenues in our data business, which represents nearly half our revenues, grew 5%, marking the 39th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. A number of years ago, we saw the importance of investing in an energy platform that is truly global. One that better serves the needs of an evolving and growing commercial customer base. Today, as trade dynamics evolve and become increasingly complex, customers are seeking not only liquidity in the major global benchmarks but also in products that provide for greater precision, particularly when coupled with comprehensive data and analytics. Our global oil complex spans over 600 products, including locational spreads, product spreads and refining spreads, products that are built off of our benchmark contracts, such as Brent crude oil and gas oil. And as the natural gas markets gained greater importance around the world, our customers are increasingly turning to our global platforms for their risk management needs.","In the third quarter, we reached another record in our European TTF and Asian JKM gas contracts, helping to drive record revenues across our natural gas complex through the first nine months of 2019. In our financial markets, the MSCI equity derivative complex is having another strong year, with average daily volume up 16% through the end of the third quarter. And since moving to the ICE platform in 2014, open interest in our MSCI futures contracts has grown at an average annual rate of over 20%. In late September, we announced the extension of our existing licensing arrangement and expansion of our partnership with MSCI, following on the strong performance that we have together enjoyed. As a part of this expansion, MSCI plans to integrate ICE's pricing and reference data into its growing suite of services. And ICE plans to launch a suite of new futures contracts based on MSCI's leading ESG franchise and access MSCI's ESG data to bring new and innovative indices to market.","So these are just a few examples of how we listen to our customers' needs, work closely with key industry participants and apply our technology and operating expertise to grow the ecosystems that surround our markets. Over the past few months, we've launched a number of exciting early stage strategic initiatives that will help establish a foundation for us to continue to evolve and grow well into the future. For example, towards the end of October, in collaboration with the industry, we successfully moved the U.S. MOVE indices from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The MOVE indices will be managed by ICE Data Indices and powered by ICE Data Services analytics. This complex will join an index platform with $1 trillion of benchmarked assets, including $200 billion of AUM and exchange-traded funds. The acquisition of the move indices will also allow us to launch related futures and options products, which is yet another example of how data and trading drive a virtuous cycle.","In October, we also executed our first trade through the ICE ETF Hub. While it's early days, the activity across this platform and participant interest is building, with a number of leading authorized participants and key market makers joining BlackRock on the platform. Leveraging ICE Data Services pricing data, reference data, index offerings and intelligent analytics, the ETF Hub will act as a central portal for ETF primary trading, which is also known as the create-redeem process, while it also places our comprehensive fixed income offering in the middle of a market that is undergoing an analog to digital conversion. As the world's leading ETF sponsor, BlackRock's developmental partnership in this project is an important first step towards bringing more efficiency and standardization to the industry and supporting its continued growth. In addition to launching ETF Hub, our trading protocols within ICE bonds will soon connect to the Aladdin platform. Together with our recent integration with the Charles River platform, our institutional customers will soon have better access to ICE's various trading venues and trading protocols.","At ICE mortgage services, eNote adoption and utilization of our e-registry continues. This year, through the end of September, nearly 80,000 eNotes have been created, which is almost 5x that of all of 2018. Lenders, servicers, investors and custodians are making the decision to go digital, and they're demanding efficient, more comprehensive solutions across the U.S. mortgage industry's workflow. And in September, Bakkt successfully launched its first-ever physically settled bitcoin future. And soon after, we successfully completed the first ever physical delivery of bitcoins pursuant to this regulated environment. These are important steps towards bringing trusted infrastructure to digital assets. In our experience, secure and regulated infrastructure is vital to investors and consumers, no matter what the asset class. And with trusted operations, state-of-the-art cybersecurity and end-to-end regulation, Bakkt hopes to establish user confidence and provide an ecosystem that can facilitate the broad adoption and secure transfer of digital assets.","I'll conclude my remarks on Slide 8. The third quarter was another example of strong execution across our platform. We delivered record revenues and record operating income. EPS grew double digits, and we continue to invest in future growth, all while returning a record amount of capital to our shareholders. As we look forward to the fourth quarter and beyond the 2020, we're excited about the growth opportunities that lie ahead. We've built a scalable platform, uniquely positioned to evolve and to grow, and we will continue to work closely with our customers and key industry participants to apply our technology and operational expertise to improve markets and create value for all of our stakeholders.","So I'd like to thank our customers for their business in the third quarter and thank my colleagues at ICE for their efforts that contributed to the very best quarter in our company's history. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Andrew, our moderator, to conduct the question-and-answer session until 9:30 Eastern Time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Richard Repetto of Sandler O'Neill.","Richard Repetto","So I guess the first question is on the data and listing segment. The ASV still is growing at that 5% clip, but I would say when you gave the guidance earlier on line-by-line, as far as pricing analytics and exchange data and desktops, et cetera, that the growth is sort of varying from what you gave initially. Scott, I guess, can you update us why that's changed? I guess, you could say some of the desktop connectivity, the Global Network has helped you but should we -- why the differences? And should we -- does it really make any difference, I guess.","Scott Hill","It's a good question, Rich. And I think it's instructive. I forget when, but Jeff made a comment a couple of calls ago that effectively -- the business we bought four years ago, sold one product that's sold bond prices. And each year, it would raise prices a couple of percent, and it would hope that it could have the similar retention with customers. What we've built is what I think Jeff referred to as a data superstore, where it's not just bond prices, it's prices, it's reference data, it's fee, it's connectivity solutions, it's -- by the way feeds that are real-time prices, and now, we've launched our data vault, which will give you historic prices. And so more and more, what we're able to do with customers is sell beyond just bond prices and to go beyond just what this year's 2% to 3% price increase will be. And so I do think the focus shouldn't necessarily be on a single line and really should look more at the collective, because that's what we're selling.","We're selling feeds, which is in exchange data. We're selling connectivity, which is in connectivity, and we're selling pricing and the reference data, which is in P&A. And just to kind of even it out, year-to-date, our growth in the data business has been 5%, pricing and analytics has been 5%, exchange data has been 6%, desktops and connectivity has been 6%. That's a pretty good balance, and it's because we have products and offerings that our customers need in each of those lines. And so did I think earlier in the year that pricing and analytics are going to be a little closer to 6%? I did, but I also didn't expect us to see quite the performance we have in connectivity. But again, we're selling what the customers want to buy, and I expect actually that the dynamics next year are going to be fairly similar. As I said, I think pricing and analytics growth is going to accelerate again into the fourth quarter. And I think it's positioned to grow 5%, 6% as we look into 2020. Connectivity, again, I think we're looking at a business next year that could generate another 4% or 5% growth on top of it. Exchange data is a little bit of a wildcard. If you think about our fourth quarter guidance, we got a bit of a drag, particularly related to the NYSE. So setting that wildcard aside, again, I think there's going to be a solid contribution from each of those businesses. And what we're focused on is a data business that grew 5% 3 years ago, grew 5% last year, going to grow 5% this year and is positioned to deliver the 4% to 6% model range that we've given again in 2020.","Richard Repetto","Got it. That's helpful, Scott. And my follow-up would be, I guess, to Jeff, and Ben. But on the ETF Hub, we got it launched. And from what I understand right now, it's focused on equity, ETFs and just the, I believe, it's just the creation and redeem and maybe -- probably secondary trading, too. But I guess my question is, given what you've seen so far, how does that make you feel about the transfer when you try to get the create redeem in fixed income. I know you got BlackRock, and that certainly helps. But what can -- have we learned in just the few weeks that we've got it up, that it can be transferred over to not only that primary create redeem but the secondary trading in fixed income? Or is it just too early to tell?","Benjamin Jackson","Thanks, Rich. It's Ben Jackson. Great question. And we're very excited about the controlled launch that we've had on the ETF Hub over the past couple of days of getting that up and off the ground with our partners as you highlighted. And our focus right now is really about building out the network. And the opportunity for both us and the customers is twofold. So -- and you touched on both areas. So first is the primary market. And when you think about the primary market, this is a completely underserved market today. There is not one independent provider of services that's providing a single marketplace, whereby multiple issuers can connect to multiple banks to really negotiate in both equities and fixed income, what is that acceptable basket of security.","So for an equity ETF, what is that basket of single name equities that I need go out and procure in order to swap with an issuer, that basket of equity securities for a single share of an equity ETF. And in fixed income, it's acquiring a basket of bonds that, when acceptable to that issuer, can be swapped in our marketplace for a single share of a fixed income ETF. For us, this is what we're replacing is issue -- either issuer provided systems, which are very bespoke, each issuer has their own. Some issuers have multiple in different asset classes. A lot of this is done over the phone, spreadsheets, it's manual and it's very disconnected. And what we're introducing to the marketplace for the first time is a single marketplace, whereby, again, multiple issuers and banks can perform this whole negotiation process and then can consummate that swap of the basket of securities for the ETF trend, for the ETF share and then settle that transaction. So this is 100% greenfield opportunity, and the industry has embraced this.","We have an advisory committee that's been a part of this, that consists of multiple big issuers as well as all the big banks and APs and market makers that are part of that. Our controlled launch is in equities, as you've mentioned, with BlackRock and several of the big APs and banks that were mentioned in a press release this past week, and we're going to be soon launching in the coming weeks fixed income. We feel really good about the network that we're starting to establish through the balance of 2019, it's going to be about continuing to build out that network and into 2020, around building out the functionality for multiple asset classes in that network in that primary trading environment.","The second thing you touched on is secondary trading. So secondary trading, so this is downstream of the hub. And this is the actual procurement of equity. So when you think of procuring equities to go into the basket, you can go to a venue like the New York Stock Exchange. In fixed income, and you all know a lot of the usual suspects in the institutional space and in fixed income trading platforms like Bloomberg, market access and trade web, those are the entities that have historically been downstream in the procurement of bonds to go into that [indiscernible] that once assembled, those bonds would then go into our primary marketplace to swap for that individual share of a fixed income ETF. For the first time, our venues are going to be downstream of this ETF creation and redemption process, helping to provide another choice for customers, either through our central order book platform, our RFQ platform or our portfolio auction platform. And again, this is a space we haven't played in prior, and the integration efforts that Jeff mentioned in his commentary around our completed integration with Charles River, in our -- in the coming weeks will be completed with our integration with Aladdin all helps us to really establish and build out this network. So we feel great about it.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Carrier of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Michael Carrier","Scott, maybe first one, just on expenses. So this quarter, a little bit better. You mentioned the onetime benefit, and even the fourth quarter looks pretty good. Just anything that's impacting the expense base on the synergy side? And then in an environment where we're seeing pretty healthy, like revenue growth, just wanted to get your view on some of the expense initiatives that you have in place, what we should be thinking about in terms of the incremental margin in the business?","Scott Hill","Thanks, Mike. It's a good question, and it's the right time of year to be thinking about that as we get ready to take the Board our 2020 budget. I'm sure you all starting to pay attention to your 2020 model. So I think, look, within the expense base, I think the key thing is, and I said it in my prepared remarks, if you think about 2019 and look at where we're landing right now, we're actually landing in the middle of our original guidance, even though we've added about $50 million from Simplifile and the accounting change to move some of the net to gross revenues around our revenue share agreement. That's been mitigated by about $20 million of onetime items. That notwithstanding, we're still sitting right in the middle of that original guidance. So the expense performance has been good. We delivered on the last of the $30 million of synergies, but then we've additionally been able to mitigate another $15 million to $20 million of expense on our more recent acquisitions.","And then in addition to that, just our normal expense management, which I think over the years, it has been demonstrated as a core competency of ours. And so as you start to think about next year, I think the model for next year is going to look a lot like it has the last couple of years, where we're going to reward our employees with a salary increase, consistent with what we've done in the past couple of years. We're going to have some expense growth that will be in support of revenue. You saw some of that. If you look at the tech line, for example, in the third quarter, that's reflective of good growth on the top line and some of the revenue share, which shows up in that line. So I think our overall expense performance this year has been very good, as you alluded to. And then I think as you think about 2020, if you look back at the way we've modeled and guided going into the last couple of years, it's going to look very similar.","Specific to the investments, I think part of the good news is ETF Hub is launched. That investment's in our run rate. Bakkt, we're now a year through. I expect there'll be some acceleration in that investment as we move into next year. But again, largely in the run rate that we've got. And so a lot of the initiatives that you hear us talk about are in the expense run rates that we've shown you. And again, that's an expense run rate that's led to us actually doing better than what we thought we would be entering this year.","Michael Carrier","Okay. That's helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up. There was a white paper out and some of the clients that use CCPs around, skin in the game again. Just more curious on your thoughts, if anything's changed or why this is coming up again in any new conversations with regulators, is anything is changing on that front?","Scott Hill","Yes. So thanks for the question, and I'll put my clearing head on and take my CFO head off for a moment. So I think a couple of things. I think first of all, they're not a lot new in that paper. These are things we've been hearing for five years. Number two, it's a relatively small number of signatories. Big important names in a lot of places, important partners and customers, but a small fraction of the people that actually participate in our markets. In terms of timing, I think there was an industry conference that Jeff just flew back from, and so the timing is not surprising because it gives you a venue to talk about things that you've been saying for five years and aren't particularly sticking. But I think the important thing is dig into the substance of it, right? So they want us to put 20% of the guarantee fund as our skin in the game, which effectively is we'll fund the risk that they bring to the clearinghouse. Because remember, clearinghouses don't create risk, we manage risk. We don't take a long position.","We take a long, and we take an offsetting short. We collateralize that with IM. By the way, IM that's based on models that a third-party validates, that a risk committee made up of clearing member approves, that a regulator approves and then an independent board approves. So the next time that I implement a risk model in one of our clearing houses with no oversight will be the first time and probably the last time for me in the job as well. So I think if you look at what's in the paper, we're very interested in a dialogue because, again, those are important partners and customers, but I do think that there's a little bit of a look over here and a request to try and mitigate some of the capital requirements on those firms versus a true view that there is some risk that needs to be managed. And so again, we're engaged in the dialogue. We are proactively taking steps to address some of the issues raised. But beyond being in the dialogue, I don't really expect it to move the needle. As I said, it's not particularly new, and it hasn't moved the needle in the last years.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan.","Kenneth Worthington","Maybe first, can you talk about the penetration of the credit in muni markets and what sort of market share of those trading instruments you have done or what market share has done since your acquisitions of BondPoint and TMC? If shares increased, by about how much? And I know it's early in the implementation of your strategy as ETF Hub just turned on, but I'm sort of wondering about how the penetration of those markets is looking prior to some of your big initiatives getting underway.","Benjamin Jackson","Ken, it's Ben. Thanks for the question. On the volumes front, so one of the things I mentioned on, I believe it was the prior call, is that our platforms, when you look at them retroactively, look at them backwards looking, they were historically concentrated in the municipal space. And if you look at just MSRB volumes, they've been very tough. The municipal space has been a very, very tough area for all-comers this year. And the good news is, we're actually outperforming MSRB. But again, it's been a tough market in the municipal space. The good news that we have seen on the platform is that the volumes, that while munis have been tough, we have seen treasuries really grow strong. As with munis falling out of favor, treasuries have come into favor. Now in the past year, a little over a year that we've owned both platforms, our focus has been on integrating the businesses and getting the businesses operating together, which we've completed. So they're now in a single business called ICE bonds for us. We've actually executed on a project over the past year to develop self-clearing to be able to create a more efficient clearing platform of bonds underneath these businesses, which will help us lower the cost of running the businesses. And the third thing that we've been doing is consolidating the broker dealers, and that will be taking place in the early part of next year, again, providing more efficiency to the operation of those businesses.","In parallel to all that integration work, we have been heavily focused on the institutional initiatives underpinning these to really repurpose these businesses and to point them to where we see the real opportunity in the marketplace. And the things we've had to do is execute on building out our RFQ platform, which we've done, leveraging the expertise that we've had in the RFQ space in commodities for a number of years, and that represents 20% of our volumes. We've executed, as Jeff mentioned in his prepared remarks, on integrating to some of the big OMS platforms with CRD complete, with Charles River development complete and then Aladdin to be completed in the next couple of weeks. And we've also built out our portfolio auction capabilities, which, if you read any press articles, you can see that, that's an area that's been involved for both the buy-side and sell-side as a more efficient solution for executing trades. And to give you a sense on that portfolio auction side, we have, in a controlled launch type of manner, getting that portfolio auction off the ground.","We've been partnering with asset managers, as asset managers are oftentimes benchmarked to one of our indices. So one of the indexes that we bought from the Bank of America Merrill Lynch, or they can be benchmarked to a third-party index. When benchmarked to a third-party index or ours, our pricing and reference data, more often than not, is underpinning those indices as well as those asset managers. As in the asset manager space, we have well north of three quarters of the asset managers around the world utilize our data to strike their NAVs and have done that for decades. The ability for us to combine for an asset manager, a portfolio auction to be able to trade all of their -- the entire basket that they're looking to rebalance against the portfolio in a single trade and then also give them the ability to price that, either at where our prices are that they've been using for decades or as a spread to those prices, it's a pretty powerful combination. And we saw in the third quarter in one of the portfolio auctions, to give you an example, in a single trade, a notional size of $275 million went off on that single portfolio auction trade.","So this is something that we're looking to we've had some success with, and we're going to look to further engage with our customers in another area of growth. But again, on the execution side, what we see and our focus is on really building out our network, expanding our capabilities into the institutional space for execution, which is a space we've historically not been leveraging the strength that we have in our pricing, reference data and analytics businesses.","Jeffrey Sprecher","Ken, this is Jeff. If I could just underline what Ben said is, we didn't have a natural nexus into the execution of bond securities. And so -- and there are some very good companies that are in that space, as you're aware. So we were late, if you will, to building out an execution venue. But as Ben mentioned, we admitted and recognized that we were late. And so we pivoted hard to build out all of the other things that we know tend to flow from having a good execution venue. And so we built out the data platform and are the predominant fixed income data provider now. And with $1 trillion of ETFs benchmarked against our indices now buying the MOVE volatility index, which is one of the major indices, buying the Bank of America, 5,000 indices that surround largely the fixed income space. We, in a way, leapfrogged where we would have otherwise been to have the back end and the ancillary benefits that we know come from having a strong execution venue. And so what Ben is working on is essentially levering off of that strong back end to move forward into the execution space, including, as he's talked extensively about, the ETF Hub, which is really at the root of where most demand is created for execution.","Operator","The next question comes from Dan Fannon of Jefferies.","Daniel Fannon","Just wanted to talk about M&A and kind of capital return as you think about next year. And can you just talk about the landscape today in terms of kind of how active you are in terms of what you're looking at for potential M&A, if it's different than other periods? And obviously, this past 12 months has been heavily focused on buybacks, and is that kind of a reasonable base case as we think about 2020?","Scott Hill","Yes, it's a good question. I think the simple short answer is our approach hasn't changed in terms of how we think about M&A, and it's how we approach it. Obviously, there are some interesting things that are going on in the landscape. But you've kind of seen over the last couple of years what our game plan is, and that is look at adjacent spaces where we think there's a market opportunity we can serve. A couple of years ago, it was buying the bond businesses, and Jeff just described the logic behind that strategy. More recently, we've been building a mortgage business and made some smaller acquisitions there. That's already $140 million run rate revenue business for us if you add Simplifile on a full year and with MERS. And the good news is, just linking over to your question about capital return, is we've been able to do those deals and grow our capital return. So we're going to end up returning over $2 billion this year, which is going to be around 20% more than we did last year, which was a record year, which was bigger than the year before that.","We've returned it through share buybacks, but we've also grown the dividend consistently double digits every year since we've implemented it. And effectively, as I said in my prepared remarks, and as we've consistently said over the years, our strategy is to grow our capital returns as we grow, to return 100% of the cash we don't need in deals. And with the strength of our balance sheet, we've been able to do both effectively. We've been able to do deals and return capital. And so we continue to monitor the environment. We look for deals that can generate the types of returns that our shareholders expect from us that can help us grow earnings that are an appropriate strategic fit that help us effectively make marketplaces better. And to the extent we find those, we'll go execute on them because we've proven that we're good at it. To the extent we don't find the right opportunity at the moment, we'll return capital as we have.","Jeffrey Sprecher","And I'll just mention that the market, the M&A market, the advisers and private equity firms and people that are at the core of transactions seem to like some of the deals that were done in our industry, where essentially, a company that was a public company that had a low multiple can move to a company that has a high multiple, and there'll be a multiple expansion. And same business, same company, different hands, different management team that the market likes better and you get a multiple expansion. And so we're being presented a lot of deals that -- because we have a good management team here, the people and a good multiple that many of you have helped reward us with, people are presenting deals that are simply multiple expansion deals. Those are interesting, but we have other metrics that we use, return on invested capital being one of them. Our ability to feel like, as a management team, we really could do something different than other management teams and\/or that network provides some kind of acceleration of sales because of its unique distribution, those kinds of things that help us justify doing deals. But just pure multiple expansion or pure onetime gain, it just isn't the thing that we tend to look at because I'm not sure in the long run we would be rewarded. And I'm not sure in the long run this management team would leave a company for future management teams that would really be strong and have efficacy.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The next question comes from Alex Kramm of UBS.","Alexander Kramm","Just a follow-up on ETF Hub, a couple of things, actually. On the one hand, I think you're talking about the authorized participants and market makers that you've been adding, but I think the one thing that's been absent is other issuers. So I think there may be some on the advisory council, but where were you in that? Because I think the idea is to really drive an industry solution and standardization. And then just a quick one for Scott also on ETF Hub, I know it's early, but I think there are some connectivity fees. And so maybe can you just talk about the near-term revenue impact? And in particular, whether it'll show up? I mean, is this going to be like data revenues, that's going to be accreting to?","Benjamin Jackson","Alex, it's Ben. On the latter point that you brought up; I can hit it for Scott. But the focus in, and I commented on it and Jeff commented as well in his commentary, focus right now is really in building out that network. And in Jeff's prepared comments, he mentioned that BlackRock is a key development partner. We acknowledged and the industry acknowledged very early on that this is a pain point across the industry, across multiple issuers, because there is no single independent provider of services to really stitch this all together as a single marketplace, where banks and APs can very efficiently access multiple issuers through a single marketplace and through a single portal to execute their transactions. So we see this as we seen in any other marketplace, as a marketplace that when we partner closely with the industry and understand what the pain points are, that it's another one that we can help, provide some innovation to, provide some real efficiency to the marketplace.","And as you mentioned, Alex, we do have other issuers. The other major issuers that you can think of are all on the advisory committee. BlackRock was the early adopter to this and pushed this early on, but those other issuers are in the weeds and in detail with us, pounding through the requirements, working through and going through demos of how everything works, giving us constant feedback on it. And as we expand this marketplace, not only in equities where we started, but in the coming weeks into fixed income. Fixed income is the area of the marketplace that has really the most inefficiency. And as we get that functionality out and released, we're optimistic that the other issuers and all the feedback they've been providing and all the time that they've been spending and helping us build this out will come on board. But it's going to take time, and this is a real sea change for the marketplace as we're replacing a whole bunch of very analog manual types of processes that requires a real business change. So it's going to take time to play out in 2019 and 2020 and for that network to build, but we feel great about the position we're in right now.","Alexander Kramm","And Scott, do you have anything on the revenues? Will they show up?","Scott Hill","I think that was reflected in Ben's answer. I think the financial impact of this is going to be felt beyond 2020, and next year is really more about building out the network. So I think that's where things stand with regards to 2020.","Alexander Kramm","Fair enough. Just every little bit helps the data growth. So I just wanted to double check.","Scott Hill","It does, indeed.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Just maybe back on the data revenue. And thanks, Scott, for that detailed outlook on the pricing analytics and desktops. Obviously, the exchange side is the wildcard. Maybe just if you can comment on what drove that down sequentially this quarter? And as we think about that going forward, obviously, the NYSE is the drag on that. Am I right in thinking that's around $50 million or so revenue pool that could fluctuate or have a headwind? Just to think of how much of a drag that could be on that 5% to 6% data revenue growth rate. And I just wanted to confirm, mortgage documentation, is that $35 million in the quarter based on your $140 million comment?","Scott Hill","Yes. So I'll only give you a -- just a couple of data points on the exchange data. I said in my prepared remarks, in the third quarter that the 3% exchange data with 6% futures, and I didn't really say an NYSE number, but you can kind of do the math given they're balanced out. And if you kind of roll forward into the fourth quarter, and I've already seen a couple of notes that are kind of looking at the revenue guidance and where that will lead the growth, I said, we're going to accelerate growth in pricing and analytics. I said the connectivity growth is going to continue to be solid. And so again, in exchange data, it's going to be a story of futures, which is up 4% to 6%. And the average, it is probably close to flat, given the dynamics that we're seeing at the NYSE. And so when I say it's a wildcard, there is that issue. As I roll into next year, I don't expect it to be down. But I think Jeff said it the right way last time, it's not something that's really going to contribute to growth. It won't detract, but it won't contribute.","Jeffrey Sprecher","Yes, there's an interesting dynamic at the NYSE that I don't think it's fairly covered by the press, and I don't mean the press is unfair. I just mean I don't think they understand the nuance of -- the SEC has taken a lot of actions around exchange pricing of the NYSE and its peers, competitors. The press tends to act, the articles tend to suggest that the exchanges won't be able to raise prices. I think what's failed to be understood is that the exchanges actually can't even lower prices, and the exchanges can't really offer new products or bundles or do any other actions, things are frozen. So we actually have an interest in lowering some prices because we think it will stimulate more demand. Our demand and growth of data around the NYSE is heavily driven by new products and new services and new bundles and new ways of looking at things, not straight price increases. And it's really been an expansion. I think we have over 40 data products, the connectivity and data products at the exchange that have been built over the last decade or so. And it's that business that causes it to grow.","So as we think about budgeting for next year, we're just looking at a market where that it's likely frozen. And that's -- as you think about building your models, I mean, it's just that. And this is now the subject of litigation. Every single filing, the bank through SIFMA for years have been wanting to litigate. The exchanges are litigating back now, both within the SEC and in venues outside of the SEC. So there doesn't seem to be a quick resolution unless the industry wants to come together and figure out how to allow innovation around those products, which may or may not happen. There's certainly a lot of conversation going on around the data space.","Operator","The next question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein","I want to go back to data services for a second, and Scott, appreciate the more kind of holistic approach to the segment, but really wanted to zone in on pricing and analytics. I think, historically, this has been viewed as kind of the fastest growth engine within the segment, and it looks like the dynamics are slowing down a little bit. If you look at ASV, it's up 5% year-over-year. I think this time last year, it was going to be up 8%. So I guess, taking a step back and looking under the hood a little bit, what are you seeing that's slowing down that growth? And looking ahead, what products do you expect to perhaps contribute more to the growth from here?","Scott Hill","Yes, it's a good question. Thanks. So I think the first thing I'd do just to put some numbers on the table because I can't help myself, we've grown our data business two years ago, last year, this year, 5%. And on average, pricing and analytics has grown closer to 5.5% on average over that same time period. So it has led the growth. And don't forget, that is the IDC business that used to grow 2% to 3%. And so we're growing it twice as fast, and it's because of all the dynamics I mentioned earlier that I won't repeat here. As we roll into next year, in a model -- data revenue model range on an organic basis of 4% to 6%, I mentioned, I think that business is closer to 6% next year. I said, we think we can grow overall 4% to 6%. I would say, again, pricing and analytics is going to lead the chart. I think that the dynamic that you're seeing in ASV simply reflects some of the sales activity we have, where, again, we've gone from a sales team that four years ago, had one tool in the kit, which was bond prices to a world where we have lots of tools in the kit.","And so we may be willing to take a short-term trade off on bond prices if you'll buy more reference data from us, if you'll let us become your feed provider, if you'll buy our historic data through our data vault. And so that tends to flush through a little bit in a specific lines ASV. But overall, it's good for the bottom line of the business in the next quarter and more importantly, over the next year or two because it sustains high retention levels. It gives us more ability to resell, it gives us pricing opportunity down the road, and so that's why I answered Richard's question earlier the way I did, which is I don't think you should get too hung up on it. And I think last quarter, Ken asked a similar question, where I said I'm not too focused on whether ASP in a particular quarter is 6% or 5% or 7%, as long as the overall ASV is kind of in that 4% to 6% range, which it is, again, this quarter, as you can see in the appendix slide. So I think the dynamic in pricing and analytics is actually a healthy one because while we may not see the yield directly in that line, we're seeing it in the other lines and importantly, on the bottom line.","Jeffrey Sprecher","And one other point I'd like to reiterate. I made a comment in my prepared remarks that we've tried to design this business so that it's not correlated to headcount in our customers. If you think about what we're doing, we've talked a lot to you all about the fact that we've got this amazing portfolio, and we like this notion of bundling. And so we are bundling enterprise solutions that are not headcount-oriented and it's why I think over time -- because we do see consolidation in the space. I mean we were an early consolidator of exchanges and execution venues, but we've seen brokers consolidate, high-frequency traders consolidate, asset managers consolidate. We've seen a broad consolidation across the financial services landscape as scale matters, as capital is looking for global alpha. And so we have redesigned the way we go to market, and it seems to be working for us.","Operator","The next question comes from Owen Lau of Oppenheimer.","Owen Lau","Questions related to Bakkt. One of your competitors launched a bitcoin futures in December 2017, and it will probably take them over two years after the launch of bitcoin futures to launch bitcoin options. What kind of feedback did you get from your customers to facilitate your potential launch of bitcoin futures, just two months after your launch of bitcoin futures? And also, it seems that Bakkt would also enter into the consumer payment space. What are the key characteristics of a digital asset that would be most likely become the digital currency in this space?","Jeffrey Sprecher","Those are good questions. You've obviously been following along what we're doing there and looking between the margins. So really coming up with a regulated footprint for digital assets is something that is designed to attract traditional financial services players. Global retail customers have been very comfortable for whatever reason being early adopters on unregulated platforms that call themselves exchanges but really have no particular regulatory oversight, and it's not -- and lack transparency as to how consumer capital is being handled. And so we think there's an opportunity in what we're building out with Bakkt to bring that whole thing into a more transparent regulatory footprint and lend our expertise of regulation and trust, if you will, to these digital assets. The kind of institutions that are -- so first of all, all financial institutions are talking to us and looking at this and trying to figure out where this fits and what the global regulators are going to think about this and so on and so forth, so there's a tremendous amount of dialogue around it. But what you're seeing is the kinds of institutions that are coming into the space quickly that our institutional investors are new kinds of crypto hedge funds, crypto market makers.","Many of these are players we know who have started an offshoot of their business to deal with digital assets. And the major banks are working with us, the major brokers are working with us, but still trying to figure out how this fits into their own ecosystem. And they know that when they do move into this space, it's got to be it's got to be regulated and approved by their own regulators. As we have been dealing with Bakkt backdrop, very quickly, people said that there's an active options market for bitcoin out there that is even less transparent in most cases than the cash market, and a lot of it is done OTC. It's OTC brokers and what have you, but there's a strong interest in having options. It just so happens that the way we've launched our bitcoin futures contract is that we are a source of price discovery because we're physically delivered. We're not dependent on the prices that come out of these unregulated cash markets. We develop our own settlement price, and so that it lends itself very nicely to an options market where people that trade options and hedge with the underlying can have perfect hedging in one venue that they know is transparent. So that was the pressure to get the options out quickly.","On the payment side, we think that the digital asset space has largely been a speculative space that with speculators, speculating on the future value, the future efficacy, the future use cases of many of the digital tokens that exist. And we don't think that, that whole space will be relevant and grow unless there are real use cases. And we do, as you pointed out, I think that a use case is going to be the digital transfer of value through payments. And a bitcoin, which is where we have most of our focus is one digital token that could potentially be used for payments but has also, because of its mining capabilities and the way it's been developed, is really a store of value. Now I argue, I'm an old guy, and I argue to the younger people that work at Bakkt, and it's very much a younger workforce that's there, engineers that we've hired from many of the payment companies around the world. They view bitcoin as a digital gold. But I, because I'm old, I think of gold became a store value because at one point, it was a currency. We had gold coins, it was in circulation. And over time, because of the nature of its ability to spend that over time, it got hoarded and became a store value.","And today, in a crisis, we all accept gold as a form of payment. And in fact, the very first product that we launched at Intercontinental Exchange in year 2000 was an overnight gold contract that was used interbank to settle differences between trading by sending actual gold receipts as opposed to currency. So I do think bitcoin will have an element of payments and as well as a store of value because it may well be that rather than convert bitcoin to fiat currency and then use fiat currency to buy goods and services that merchants and users will accept bitcoin directly, and you'll avoid the foreign exchange, if you will, the FX cost of converting back and forth the fiat. And so we are building out that digital platform, in one of -- we have probably 50 people dedicated to building out the infrastructure, and it's quite an exotic and unique thing that I think you'll see us rollout as we move into 2020, and we'll test the old guy's thesis here.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Warren Gardiner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Warren Gardiner","Good morning. ICE's fourth quarter 2018 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the theice.com. These items will be archived, and our call will be available for replay.","Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements which we undertake no obligation to update represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2018 Form 10-K, which we filed this morning.","In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures including adjusted income, EPS, operating income, operating margin, expenses, effective tax rate, organic data revenue, free cash flow and EBITDA. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more effective of our cash operations and core business performance.

Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain items.","Also, with us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Ben Jackson, our President.","I'll now turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Hill","Thanks, Warren. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our record fourth quarter performance. ICE's consolidated fourth quarter net revenues increased 14% year-over-year to a record $1.3 billion. Trading and clearing net revenues were a record $657 million and data and listings revenues totaled a record $651 million underpinned by organic constant currency growth of 6%.","Adjusted operating expenses totaled $553 million in the quarter. Our fourth quarter expenses included a $5 million increase in our performance-related compensation reflecting the strong end to a good year. In addition, the quarter included around $3 million related to organizational restructuring and a few million dollars of non-recurring items. These items weren't contemplated in our original guidance and aren't expected to be recurring.","Continuing with our fourth quarter highlights, adjusted operating income grew 14% year-over-year and we delivered record adjusted earnings per share of $0.94, a 25% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2017. Importantly, that strong earnings growth combined with reduced CapEx spend generated record free cash flow of $2.3 billion, up 32% versus the prior year.","I'll discuss the way we put that cash to work on slide 5. During the fourth quarter, we deployed the remaining $140 million of our 2018 $1.2 billion repurchase authorization. When combined with the $555 million in dividends we paid, the capital return to shareholders during 2018 totaled nearly $1.8 billion. That record capital return is 23% higher than last year and nearly double what we returned just a few years ago.","We did all of this while maintaining our target leverage and investing over $1 billion in strategic initiatives including fixed income, mortgages and along with our partners the launch of Bakkt.","The strong cash generation of our business model will continue to support our disciplined approach to investment and capital return once again in 2019. As we've indicated in the past, we're committed to growing our dividend as the company grows. Reflecting that commitment, our board authorized a 15% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.275 per share. And as we noted on our third quarter call, our board has approved a $2 billion share repurchase authorization from which we've already deployed around $115 million in January.","Now, let's move to slide 6 where I'll provide an overview of the fourth quarter performance of our trading and clearing business. Trading and clearing revenue which increased 14% for the full year grew to $657 million in the fourth quarter with both energy and ag revenue up 13% and financials revenue up 28%. Fourth quarter ADV and our futures business increased 21% year-over-year as energy, ag, rate and equity index products all increased versus the prior year.","While January volumes across our Futures & Option complex are down year-over-year, they're up sequentially versus an unusually strong December. And importantly, open interest continues to build with OI at the end of January 4% higher than a year ago led by continued strength in oil and interest-rate products. At the NYSE, transaction revenues increased 35% year-over-year driven by higher industry volumes and market share gains across cash equity and options as well as the acquisition of CHX.","ADV in our cash equity's business increased 45% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and average daily volume in our options business was up 44%. This momentum carried into January with cash equity volumes up 19% year-over-year. Moving to fixed income and credit, which includes CDS clearing, our fixed income trading businesses and ICE Mortgage Services revenue totaled $83 million for the quarter. CDS clearing revenue increased 25% year-over-year and is growing at a compound growth rate of 15% since 2012. New participants, new products and the need for additional credit protection remain catalyst for that business.","Turning next to slide 7, I'll discuss the data and listings segment. Fourth quarter data services revenue grew 6% on an organic constant currency basis to a record $539 million. For the full-year, data services revenues grew 5% on an organic constant currency basis including 6% growth in products included in our ASV, which account for roughly 90% of our data services business. Within data services during the fourth quarter, revenue from an exchange data and feeds grew 7% and desktops and connectivity grew 1% each on an organic constant currency basis.","Please note that beginning with the fourth quarter, we have moved our feeds business out of desktops and connectivity and into exchange data. This better distinguishes the exchange related content we sell from our distribution capabilities and it provides a better comparison to our data services peers. We've provided a restatement of historical data services results to reflect this change in the Appendix.","Revenues from pricing and analytics, which represent half of our data revenues and nearly quarter 1\/4 of our total revenues, were up 7% on an organic constant currency basis for the third consecutive quarter. As you can see on the slide, our pricing and analytics revenue growth has accelerated from nearly 4.5% in 2016 to more than 5% in 2017 and now to over 6.5% in 2018. This accelerating growth reflects contributions from every component of our revenue model, new customers, new products, increased consumption from existing customers, and targeted price increases. And importantly ASV for pricing and analytics entering 2019 is up 7%, giving us confidence and continued momentum.","Finally, in our listings business, revenues grew 8% in the fourth quarter and the NYSE listed 16 IPOs despite heightened market volatility. And for the year, we were once again the leading U.S. exchange in terms of capital formation, helping our customers raise $30 billion in IPO proceeds.","I'll conclude my remarks on slide 8. On the left-hand side of the slide, you can see a recap of our strong 2018 performance. Revenues grew 7%, adjusted operating income grew 8%, adjusted earnings per share grew 21%, and free cash flow grew 32%.","On the right-hand side of the slide, you'll note a few points of guidance for 2019. We expect full year data services revenues to be between $2.19 billion and $2.24 billion. This includes $540 million to $545 million in the first quarter with sequential improvement each quarter thereafter. This also reflects the impact of a stronger dollar versus both the euro and pound, which is currently expected to reduce 2019 data revenues by roughly $5 million to $10 million. And of note with no material data acquisitions in 2018, currency fluctuation is the only adjustment that should be required to calculate our 2019 data revenue growth.","Moving next to expenses. We anticipate full year adjusted operating expense to be between $2.15 billion and $2.2 billion. 2018 acquisitions in our trading and clearing segment will generate roughly $35 million to $40 million in incremental expense, net of around $15 million in actions already taken to reduce the costs of those acquired businesses.","In addition to the cost savings, the expense will be more than offset by over $100 million of incremental revenue. On top of the cost savings for the recently acquired businesses, we will deliver the final $30 million of synergies related to IDC, which means we will have achieved our original commitment of $180 million in total synergies.","Next, consistent with past years, we will once again reward our employees for their strong contribution as a part of our pay-for-performance philosophy, which will increase compensation expense by $35 million to $40 million. Investments in technology as well as expenses tied to revenue growth will add around $30 million to $35 million.","And finally, our investment in Bakkt will generate $20 million to $25 million of expense based upon the run rate in the first quarter. We will update you on progress at Bakkt and the level of investment as we move through the year. We delivered another record year in 2018 and we have momentum entering 2019.","I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. But for now I'll hand it to Jeff to expand on our strategic plans entering the new year.","Jeff Sprecher","Thank you, Scott, and good morning to everyone on the call.","Let me begin on slide 9. We're pleased to report what was the best year in ICE's history and that marks our 13th consecutive year of record revenues and record adjusted earnings per share.","Our track record of growth is a testament to the strategic approach that we've taken since our inception to build a globally diverse platform that enhances our customers' workflows using technology to bring efficiency, transparency and reliability to markets.","In our futures markets, we're strategically positioned in major market centers around the world with six simple clearing houses across North America, the U.K., Europe and Asia. It's a footprint that gives our customers choice, helps insulate us from regulatory and political risk and provides a platform for product development that enables us to swiftly capitalize on growth opportunities as they emerge around the world.","Our exchanges and clearing houses operate on common technology, providing our markets with the flexibility to move jurisdictions if desired often as quickly as over a weekend. These markets run on proprietary technology, designed to meet the comprehensive workflow needs of a wide range of market participants. On top of this technology and our global distribution are the critical benchmark contracts that traders investors and commercial participants rely upon to manage their every day risks.","In our oil markets, Brent crude is the global benchmark for nearly two-thirds of the internationally traded oil that moves around the world each day. Once again, Brent generated record revenues in 2018 and it remains a cornerstone of our energy product development as well as for customer acquisition and retention in our energy business. Brent's relevance to our oil complex is complimented by our Gasoil contract.","Gasoil's been one of the fastest-growing energy benchmarks with open interest up 11% per annum on average over the last five years. Gasoil has become a key benchmark for the refined barrel including diesel and jet fuel. And the upcoming IMO marine fuel regulations which are set to take hold in 2020 could provide additional risk-management tailwinds to our oil complex.","In our natural gas markets, we offer a suite of liquid, global benchmarks, a platform that is unmatched in the marketplace. In fact, roughly two-thirds of our natural gas revenue is now derived from products other than the U.S. Henry Hub, a benchmark that is losing relevance to commercial customers as other global benchmarks grow.","As natural gas globalizes, our customers' participation in these markets have accelerated with open interest across our 58 North American natural gas spaces markets, up 17% year-over-year, our European TTF natural gas contract with open interest at near-record levels, up 64% year-over-year and with our JKM contract which is the benchmark for Asian natural gas achieving record trading volumes in January.","We see a similar dynamic in our financial futures business which includes European interest rates and equity indices. Brexit uncertainty and the shifting expectations around global economic growth, continue to drive increased hedging activities with interest-rate average daily volumes increasing 14% year-over-year and open interest up 8% through the end of January. And our alternative interest-rate complex is also benefiting from increased adoption with over $1.6 trillion of notional cleared in our SONIA products since its launch just over a year ago.","In our equities futures business, average daily volume in our MSCI index has grown at a CAGR of 34% since 2014, and was up 40% in January. In particular, as trade tensions in the U.S. and China continue to build, so too is open interest in the MSCI emerging market index. As of the end of January, open interest stood at 1.4 million contracts. And for comparison purposes, this represents over 20% of the total notional outstanding in the S&P 500 E-mini contract an amount which was less than 5% only five years ago. In addition to our futures markets we're continuously working to bring efficiencies, transparency and reliability to the U.S. cash equities markets.","At the NYSE, we've been rolling out our pillar technology, a technology that has the capacity to handle 80 billion messages a day and which should improve the customer execution and access experience to our seven distinct equities trading venues.","When combined with our hybrid designated market maker model, we provide customers with a differentiated platform that reduces volatility, provides tighter bid offer spreads and offers an all-in cost to trade that is significantly lower than the average dark pool or dark venue like the IEX exchange.","Our model of compensating designated market-makers to protect and manage stocks is a unique value proposition that shines brightest amidst market volatility such as we've seen in December as the average quoted spreads on NYSE listed and traded stocks were approximately 100 -- excuse me 180 basis points tighter and volatility was over 50% lower on the open and 60% lower on the close than our closest listing competitor.","And finally in our data services business, we continue to build on our unique platform as the leading provider of mission-critical derived data and analytics. The results of these efforts are best illustrated by the performance in our pricing and analytics business which grew nearly 7% in 2018.","Demand for our pricing and reference data analytics and indices is accelerating. Active managers continue to search for better tools and data to drive output as there's a shift towards passive investing which continues. These two trends have provided a tailwind to our business in particular to our index business.","At the end of January following the transition of the iShares preferred stock ETF, ICE had $175 billion of fixed income ETF assets tracking our indices, a whopping 80% increase from just a year ago.","Turning to slide 10 as I noted at the beginning of my prepared remarks, 2018 was yet another record year for ICE. A strong topline contribution from our transaction business was complemented by compounding growth in our data and listings business.","Coupled with strong expense management and our synergy execution, we produced double-digit EPS growth, reinforcing our conviction that we have in our long-term strategy.","And as we look to 2019 and beyond we're excited about the opportunities that lie ahead, not only for our core business but also for newer initiatives such as ICE Mortgage Services, our fixed-income businesses and Bakkt which recently raised over $180 million in its first round of funding.","I'd like to conclude by thanking our customers for their business and for their trust in 2018 and I want to thank my colleagues for their efforts that contributed to yet another very strong year for ICE. I'll now turn the call back to our operator Kerry and she'll conduct the question-and-answer session until 9:30 Eastern Time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Rich Repetto","Hi. Good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Scott. I guess, my question's going to be a broad question on some of the external sort of forces you're bumping into both in Europe and the U.S. And I guess, in Europe when you look at Brexit, Jeff, you mentioned some of the benefits that people are needing to hedge more, but could you overall give us a recap of where do you think you stand on Brexit? There's this issue of I know the tax on commodities potentially being forced by the EU.","And then in the U.S., the external forces where these ideas of compete -- new competing exchange as well as the scrutiny on data, do you think that that -- we can move on beyond that? Or what points would you highlight to investors in those areas?","Jeff Sprecher","Well, welcome to my world, Rich. You basically asked me to describe my job. So let's start with Brexit. First of all, as you've mentioned, unfortunately, we benefit from Brexit because the volatility that government actions impose on companies force them to manage their risk and we're in the risk management business. So there's really an overarching positive impact on our revenues and income.","That said, as you know we've long felt that we shouldn't consolidate all our businesses geographically. And we have a trading and clearing operation in the U.K. and we also have a trading and clearing operation in the EU. And we put both of them on common technologies, so that we have to move \"business\" around. It's really just a database move inside of our company and not a physical move. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that's something we can do over a weekend.","That said, there's a lot of political back and forth going on including now revisiting tax issues. On the tax issues specifically, this has been going on for over a decade. It's remanded to the courts now, the EU courts. In 21 months or so, the U.K. theoretically is no longer bound by the EU courts. So I don't know that it's going -- and this is going to have any practical impact other than another negotiating ploy that's going on over a complicated relationship between the U.K. and the EU as it relates to Brexit.","It's something that we -- everybody and our whole industry has lived with forever, but ICE has always maintained the optionality to move contracts and to locate business where our customers want to be. And if certain things would have to move or be relocated in order to map and minimize the impact of that we certainly would do that. We'll take our cue from the industry.","With respect to the U.S. and the members exchange, let me just set the table if I could, because for some reason there seems to be an incredible amount of concern about this press release. You have to go back to a decade or so when we've had the automation of trading particularly in the equities world. We had the Flash Boys book in the \"Flash Boys phenomenon\".","And as a result of that we saw the SEC a couple of years ago order the exchanges to do what they called a tick pilot, which was essentially widen out or narrow the spreads of certain stocks to see how they would trade. And really what that is doing is affecting the behavior of the high-frequency traders that make their income by trying to capture the bid offer spread. That pilot has finished and the data's being analyzed and you next see the SEC trying to promulgate something called a fee pilot. It's not that well named in my mind, because it actually doesn't impact the fees or the capture rate of the exchanges, but it changes theoretically over a number of different buckets the amount of rebate that can be paid to high-frequency market-making firms and brokers. There are a lot of people in our industry that are looking at the retail equity market and saying the next leg of that stool.","If one follows the SEC's actions maybe to investigate and change the way retail payment for order flow operates. And Rich, I think you know that, retail order flow that comes through retail brokers is largely sold directly to high-frequency market-makers. It never goes to exchanges. And what we saw is a group of high-frequency market-makers that participate in the retail space organized up all of the retail brokers that they pay these fees to and try to quickly move to set up an exchange that we believe is to try to get in front of what may be the trend of eliminating and changing their business model.","Now for us at the New York Stock Exchange, unfortunately, we don't see any of that retail order flow. We don't believe that that the behavior impacts us at all. In fact to the extent that those orders are not executed on after they're sold to the market-makers the exhaust which are basically people consider to be toxic because these are bids and offers that are off-market are routed to an exchange that is not us. So we have very little impact with what's going on over there.","That said, we believe that \u2013 we support what they're doing and we'll not fight to what they're doing, because we think it has still over benefits to the New York Stock Exchange. First of all, we don't compete for any retail order flow. And if the idea is that they're no longer going to be able to sell order flow directly to market-makers and it's going to have to be public competition to the retail consumers for the best bid offer we would like to compete for that. And if there's going to be a new exchange they think, they can compete for. We believe we could compete for. We have amongst the lowest cost of trading all-in cost of trading anywhere cheaper than dark pools, cheaper than the newer exchanges that have formed up. And we believe that the new exchange is going to have to cover its cost.","For us this workflow will be incremental and we believe we could offer low-cost trading that would be accretive to ICE shareholders and very, very competitive to the end user for the bid offer.","Secondly, a new exchange is going to continue to fragment order flow. Even if there are even if there's no business there bids and offers that are sent there are going to have to be viewed. That's going to increase the capacity, the network capacity needed to manage that. That means, the data spend wallet of end users is going to go up not down. And we run networks and we can compete to provide that increased capacity. That's in fact a big part of the growth of this business. So we see the wallet going up.","And lastly, one of the techniques that the SEC uses to promulgate, these changes is to essentially order the exchanges to adopt rules instead of going through a large public rule-making where \u2013 which takes a long time and have a lot of comments and difficulty getting through. Oftentimes the SEC will just order the exchanges to adopt the rule given that we have rule making capability. So this is the case for example in a consolidated audit trail.","The exchanges were ordered to build a consolidated audit trail by filing individual rules at each exchange that would allow that to happen. There's a lot of complaints in the market over who got the vote on that, consolidated audit trail for example. People that were not exchanges, didn't get a vote. Now we know the reason that the buy side and the sell side would like to have a vote is they want to make sure that they don't have to pay for it or that they can at least cap the costs.","In the consolidated audit trail case, there is no budget. It is an unlimited spend. It is one of the most technically difficult projects that has ever been attempted in our industry managing billions and billions of data point that have consumer information, that can be captured time stamped on an atomic clock and can be readily searchable for trends is a daunting challenge. And it has been a huge spend on behalf of the exchanges. So we would welcome others to come in and help to fray those costs and have a vote in that matter because they also would be pregnant with the obligations of that matter.","The recent exchanges have been fighting people having votes is that they don't have the underlying obligation. So long story short, we see that we may have an opportunity to compete for retail order flow. We believe there's going to be an increase data wallet spend and we believe that this could finally align interest in the industry. And so in that regard, I don't see why in any event anyone should consider it a negative impact on our company. I think it will ultimately accrue positive. Thank you for listening to that one-winded answer but that is my role.","Operator","The next question will come from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Ken Worthington","Hi, good morning. On the data side, your ASV is up 6%. Your revenue guide for 2019 is up 3.5% to a little under 6%. Can you help us bridge the gap between the two? Clearly, FX is a part, but I think some of the inflation Scott gave show that it was really a small part. So what are the other factors in the gap between ASV and the data revenue guide? And is BAML -- where is BAML in these figures now on the organic side? And where is it not?","Scott Hill","So, Ken first of all the guidance range we gave constant currency is roughly 4% to 6% year-over-year, so just to take any concerns or questions out regarding what a constant currency guide is in those dollar terms. If you think about ASV at 6%, if you remember that's 90% of our revenue. As I said in my prepared remarks, in 2018 our overall data business grew 5%. Our ASV revenue grew 6%. And so the elements that aren't inside ASV things like NMS, session fees et cetera haven't been and we don't expect will become big growth drivers in the overall business.","So I actually think, if you take the absolute value ASV and you consider it as 90% of our revenue, it gives you -- it pushes you right into the middle of our range. So I feel like we're set up very well to deliver another year of solid growth in the data business. The mix of that's going to look a little different. The Pricing & Analytics business as I mentioned is moved up from 4.5% to over 5% to 6.5% and I think it's headed to 7% this year. Connectivity on the other side capacity growth has been tremendous over the last couple of years. I think that will likely slow a little bit this year as customers consume that capacity. But again you're seeing that content coming through the additional capacity in Pricing and Analytics grow.","But connectivity itself is likely to be closer to a 1% to 2% growth. And then exchange data is going to be in the middle of those two with our futures and exchange data continuing to be in strong demand, some additional value capture from oil products that we were able to add to our energy packages. And so overall I feel like 2019 sets up to be a very good year and I actually think the ASV aligns perfectly with what the guidance suggests.","Operator","The next question will come from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Dan Fannon","Thanks. Good morning One more question on the data. Just looking back at your -- the pie chart from the investor data broke down the mid to high-single-digit growth and the components of that. Can you talk about the breakdown between pricing new customers incremental consumption kind of those -- the various buckets that you would outline and how that fits today as you look at 2019 where we're looking pretty much squarely like a mid-single-digit number versus that mid to high?","Scott Hill","Yeah, thanks for the question. So the interesting thing about that model is there are parts of the business where as you look at 2019 expectation it fits perfectly. There's a very good balance in the Pricing and Analytics business, which I just said I think is going to go around 7% for the year.","New products, your reference data products, indices -- by the way Ken the answer to your question is the Bank of America Merrill Lynch indices are fully organic this year. Everything is, because there weren't data acquisitions last year. So all our growth in 2019 will be organic.","But we've got new products that are driving growth, new customers; the MiFID II introduced us to a lot of small and medium-sized European customers who are now buying the breadth of our products not just things like the liquidity indicator that solved an existing need. Existing customers buying more of those MiFID II products that really drove great growth in Europe that you'll look at the back of the slide and see that our mix to Europe has actually moved back to 20% where it was 21%, 22%, back when we had trade dipped below 20% now it's back.","Those new customers buying more but then those new products existing customers in the U.S. are buying, because they need liquidity indicators and best execution indicators. And so that's driving growth. And then again we are seeing a contribution from price.","I'll note one thing in that model if you pull it out; it included roughly a point of growth from M&A. And we don't have that this year. If you look back over the last couple of years and exclude the businesses we divested our inorganic growth if you will was close to 7%.","So I look at 2019 as a year where we're going to deliver very solid growth with the 10% element that relates to M&A not present at all and then a very strong balance across pricing, across new customers, across new products et cetera in a fairly even contribution again inside Pricing and Analytics.","If you look at exchange data that really is our existing customers buying more on the future side, and growth in the number of customers consuming those products. And on the connectivity side, even though I think it will slow versus where it was, we continue to see capacity growth, which again is existing customers buying more with in fact an actual price reduction there because as they buy the larger ports, the actual price per gig comes down a little bit.","So it mixes across the elements, but I think that revenue model is still very indicative other than again in 2019, we don't have the point contribution from M&A.","Operator","The next question will come from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Q \u2013 Alex Blostein","Hey guys, good morning. Just a question around the -- I guess just thinking of the business. So maybe get an update on initiatives you guys have lined up for 2019 and credit trading on the back of the platforms that you purchased. I think on the last call maybe the call before that you talked about that being call it $100-ish million kind of trading annual run rate. Where does that stand today? And what are some things you guys are working on to get that going higher?","A \u2013 Jeff Sprecher","Let me have Ben Jackson answer that for you.","A \u2013 Ben Jackson","Thanks Alex. So our platforms had a very strong Q4 when you look at TMC and BondPoint. As a lot of you know, volatility came back to U.S. corporates and munis in the fourth quarter and we were a beneficiary of that where volume on BondPoint and TMC was up over 9% over the prior quarter and 20% over the prior year. And in notional terms, what was traded we were up 12% over the prior quarter and 50% over the prior year.","And note that I was highlighting there that notional is greater than volume which means the average trade size is also increasing on the platform. So one of the things I've talked about on prior calls is that OddBot trading, so trades of north of 100 bonds per trade has continued to increase. And last year, we saw a BondPoint, a 50% increase on an annual basis of OddBot trading and 23% increase on TMC.","The other thing I'd highlight is you've got to remember we've owned these platforms for a short period of time. So BondPoint, we've had for about a year; TMC about six months. And our integration effort is well underway. Just in the last few weeks, we've combined our business and technology teams across TMC, BondPoint, Creditex into one team, now called ICE bonds. And we're executing with a single-mission, direction, leveraging technology across the group for efficiencies and scales. So we're starting to realize some of what I have mentioned on prior calls is getting the operating income of those businesses in line with where we see our other trading businesses.","The only thing I'd say is, you've got to take a step back because buying those businesses wasn't about just fixed-income execution and isolation, it's really about providing our customers a complete integrated comprehensive solution to real challenges that there are in fixed income. When you combine real-time and end-of-day pricing, we're the market leader, providing for three million instruments around the world, not only end-of-day prices, but real-time prices.","With our reference data business where we're providing reference data, the golden record of the terms and conditions for bonds for 13 million instruments, a leader in that space. We have index expertise and fixed income that came onboard with the ICE Bank of America Merrill Lynch index business that's growing fast as mentioned in the commentary.","We also have analytics leadership in the fixed-income space where customers trust us with $1 trillion in assets to run through our analytical platforms, to understand the return attribution, to identify the next optimal trade opportunity, to identify liquidity risks that they have in their portfolio et cetera. And last but not least, you add onto that the choice of execution protocols that we have from central order book and streaming protocols that's core to the businesses that we bought and that's the most difficult protocols to establish.","When you have to manage 100 million price updates a day on BondPoint, 77 million price updates on TMC, you have securities that you can provide customers that on 10000 securities you can provide markets that have 250 bonds up on the best bid and best offer at any given point in time. We have 23000 securities with two-way markets. You have to manage best execution, manage connectivity, manage latency, all these are real challenges in building out those streaming protocols and we have that well established in our business.","In addition I've highlighted that we're building out our cue and auction capabilities that already represents 20% of the volume on those platforms and will be instrumental as well when the ETF hub project comes to life later this year that I've also talked to this group about.","And the ETF hub project gives us an opportunity to be at one of the hottest and highest growth area in the fixed-income space which is passive investing which has had a 30% CAGR over the last 10 years. That gives you a little bit of a flavor of the initiatives that we have coming down the pipe.","Operator","The next question will come from Michael Carrier of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Michael Carrier","Thanks, good morning. Scott just on the on some of the guidance on the expenses just in terms of - like some of the buckets that you gave just anywhere like $30 million, $35 million on tech investment for new growth and then the $20 million, $25 million on Bakkt just wanted to get your sense on like what are those maybe initiatives? What are the expected returns or like revenue growth associated with some of those expenses whether it's a 2019 or further out?","Scott Hill","Yes. So it's a good question. And hopefully you found the guidance pretty consistent with what we've done in prior years. And as I look at kind of the average expectation, I think they're -- in terms of 2019 expense, I think they're pretty consistent as well with two adjustments.","And I think right now you guys on average are expecting us to be around 21.60, 55 or 60. We told you that we went to work on the businesses we acquired last year and I've already taken out $15 million of costs there which if you would just use the run rate would be new news.","And then additionally as you point out, we did note that we would be investing based on our first quarter run rate $20 million to $25 million. And I said we'd keep you updated on that as we move through the year.","Specifically with regards to the revenue and the technology investments, I think those will continue to support revenue growth that likely overall is going to be in kind of that mid-single-digit range in total. That's all subject to volatility. But I definitely think those investments just as they did in 2017 and 2018 will support continued revenue growth.","I think Bakkt is really an investment and I'll hand it over to Jeff to talk a little bit about it. That's more about the future and revenue and market opportunities that we see in the future and less about 2019 topline.","Jeff Sprecher","Yes. Bakkt is a unique structure for us and that we've actually set it up as a separate company with a separate name, its own management team and separate capitalization. So right now ICE is the majority investor in the company, I expect that we'll do other rounds of financing. We'll make a decision as it goes forward whether we stay majority or allow it to spin three of us.","We believe that what ICE has if you step back and look at us is, we have obviously trading clearing. We have settlement capabilities, warehouse and custody management capabilities, large treasury operations, banking connectivity and a global infrastructure that is in many, many jurisdictions -- regulatory distinctions around the world with a massive cyber overlay.","That infrastructure has attracted a lot of very, very interesting companies that have come -- some that have invested in Bakkt, some are just working with Bakkt to try to tap into that infrastructure for some new use cases that will involve blockchain and digital assets and other things that we can provide these people. Obviously, we've announced the Starbucks -- our work with Starbucks and Microsoft. We have very, very large retail franchises global connectivity to end users that we hope will be brought into that ecosystem and could create a very, very valuable company out of that initiative if our business plan plays out.","So it's a bit of a moonshot bet and it's been organized in a manner that is very different than the way ICE typically does businesses. Bakkt has its own offices, its own management team and et cetera. And then we've entered into agreements with it to provide services, as I've described over that Bakkt -- over that ICE overlay.","So we'll see how it goes. They're well along in building out an infrastructure that I think you'll see launch later this year. And I'll let Bakkt talk more about how it wants to go about an what the business and use cases are its revenue model, et cetera, as it unfolds.","Ben Jackson","Yes. And then the other only thing I'd add is in addition to separate teams, separate office it's separately funded. We and our partners have put cash aside to fund this business. And so while it won't generate revenue in the current year, it also doesn't impact our leverage that's already funded.","It doesn't impact our capital returns. We increased the dividend 15%. We've already bought back over $115 million of shares in the quarter. And so it is funded in a sense, even though it's incremental expense on top of what you would have anticipated it is funded by cash that we and our partners have already put aside.","Operator","The next question will come from Kyle Voigt of KBW. Please go ahead.","Kyle Voigt","Hi. Good morning. Just one on M&A. Over the past few years, more of the M&A for ICE has been targeted on deals that are more bolt-on in nature. So I guess my questions really on the large-scale M&A and the exchange space. I think you've previously cited uncertainty around Brexit, uncertainty more broadly about the regulatory environment as an impediment to that occurring in the future along with the political environment, but it seems that we've gotten some clarity at least on the Brexit side for clearing, right? Can you give us an update on whether you still see the regulatory environment and this uncertainty more broadly as an impediment to large scale M&A in the sector? Thank you.","Jeff Sprecher ","I think your -- the sort of leading aspect to your question I think is correct is that things are clearing up from a regulatory standpoint, from a market structure standpoint. People have the large exchange groups have sort of stepped their footprints and it becomes more obvious where other acquisitions should flow in my mind.","In our industry, we've seen obviously the formation of large exchange groups like ICE and our peers. We've also seen a consolidation in traders particularly high-frequency trading has consolidated and we've seen a consolidation in brokers. Order flow tends to go to a more limited number. The MiFID impact of providing analysis and analytics in your space has concentrated people.","So we've been seeing a concentration across the entire financial services market that we serve. You could sort of date in there as well a number of large data companies formed up. So I do think that there will be continued M&A in our space and maybe more obvious as to where these large companies will touch one another.","That said M&A for us have to be disciplined. We've done a lot of M&A that's been opportunistic. Large M&A has been opportunistic when it's been obvious that we should get together with somebody. That's set into our model that -- where we target returns above our cost of capital and make sure that these deals work with shareholders.","And as you know we've been very disciplined on our synergy cases and we hold ourselves to high regard to deliver the synergies that we promised. And so M&A is not easy as companies get larger. But all that said, I do believe that some of the impediments are clearing.","Ben Jackson","Yes. And just in the event -- you missed it on my first slide to validate Jeff's point on the financial discipline that we've executed on our past deals, our return on invested capital is now back to 9%. In total, it's 300 basis points above our cost of capital.","And if you look at kind of outside IDC, it would've been back at 10%. And so when we say we're committed to doing deals that generate 10% returns, you see it in the results on our overall return on invested capital, which, again, as Jeff said, is that capital base has grown moving that made will continuously higher which we've done requires us to continue to grow profit which we've done.","Operator","The next question will come from Ben Herbert of Citi. Please go ahead.","Ben Herbert","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to go back to the data and particularly, Pricing and Analytics. Just within fixed income, how do you feel positioned to continue to accelerate growth there? I mean could we see more of that as you further integrate the ecosystem you've built? Or I know you gave the M&A guidance for 2019, but I mean is there an opportunity do you think to be a bit more acquisitive in the fixed-income side? Thanks.","Ben Jackson","Hi, Ben, it's Ben. I think one of the place I'd start with is some of the commentary that I've mentioned before in that our strategy when we've looked at fixed income is we took a different approach to it than many others where we looked at what is the comprehensive solution that people need to solve the real issues in fixed income. Issues like how do I get a fair price? How do I figure out for someone that doesn't trade all that often, what is the price of that instrument? How do I keep on top of all of the vast ocean of reference data I need to understand in trading that? How do I find people that when I identify a trade I want to do? How do I find somebody that has inventory that indeed wants to trade? And then on the execution side being able to offer a number of different protocols for someone to execute.","The thing I'd highlight that really pulled -- that I think is a good sign that we're heading down the right path year is that ETF hub project that I mentioned because it really -- in order to deliver that you have to have all those pieces and we're uniquely positioned to do that.","And when you think about it, for the first time later this year when we launch the ETF hub, again, one of the hottest areas of growth in the fixed income market. For the first time if you're an authorized participant or a market maker and you want to create or redeem a share of an ETF, you're going to be able to, for the first time, connect to a single portal. And in that single portal, you'll be able to connect to multiple issuers as opposed to having 12 different interfaces that you're dealing with -- interface with these -- with the issuers.","Second, you'll be able to gather the index constituents for each issuer's ETFs. So, think of all the hundreds of ETFs that they have, multiply it by the number of issuers that's all going to be able to be done in a single portal. Third, you'll be able to view that days basket constituents to be able to create or redeem a share. Every day those constituents change for each one of those funds and each one of those issuers. So you can see the problem compounds on itself as you think about it and the way that things are done today.","Fourth, you'll be able to gather market data, data from us that we're the leading price provider in the space to be able to understand what are the trading levels of the constituents and the baskets that could be created or redeemed in that day. Next, you'll be able to negotiate, what is acceptable to submit through a create or redeem. In order to do that, you have to have instant-messaging capabilities which we have a well-established instant-messaging capabilities to be able to underpin this.","And last, but not least, you'll be able to execute via our streaming protocols, our RFQ, our auctions as well as third-party venues to choose to connect through this portal. To me that's a pretty powerful sign of a place in the market that's growing very fast where market participants are pulling us into it because they see us uniquely positioned with the combination of assets that we have to solve this problem and to help the passive investing fixed-income space go to that next level of growth.","Operator","The next question will come from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Brian Bedell","Great. Thanks very much. Just Scott, on the data revenue guidance, on the constant currency basis from 4% to 6%, what do you see as the biggest drivers between the difference of the 4% to 6%? Is it mostly in pricing or actually new customers? And then, if I could just ask one -- a couple of timing questions. Just on Ben, I think you said launching the RFQ and ETF hub later this year, when you think that might start contributing from a revenue perspective, if that's later this year or 2020. And then just one on timing of NYMEX development Jeff, thanks for your answer. Prior on that, do you think that is -- the members exchange is something that actually gets up in running and can begin to affect the markets later this year? Or is that more of a 2020 type of event?","Scott Hill","Yes. So I'll start. I think there were three questions embedded in there. The 4% to 6% look I went into last year and I gave you guys a fairly tight data guidance and said we have good visibility into it, which I still believe is the case. But I think that got interpreted to something like 99.5% certainty in February. And so the range is a little wider this year just acknowledging what happened in 2018. There were some places where we had some erosion that we didn't expect on the downside in the desktop business some audits that we didn't anticipate in certain quarters as we move through the year.","And so the reality is that all of those things worked out to a year where we grew the business 5%. And as I mentioned, ASV revenues actually grew 6%. But there were some churn that ran through the stock because the $2 million or $3 million difference in any given quarter and a $15 million or $20 million difference on $2 billion of revenue for the year. And so I thought it was prudent to try and take some of the volatility out around people who are trying to guess that $1 million on $500 million in the quarter.","As I said on the call, I feel very confident that if you look at the ASV number that's going to point you right to the middle of our range. And then inside that, it's going to be driven by growth in Pricing & Analytics. So Ben's laid out a very compelling case for our overall fixed-income investment. But that's a bit -- that is effectively the IDC business that used to grow 2% to 3%. And I'm telling you it's going to grow two-and-a-half times faster than that just a few years later.","And the ASV supports that and there's a lot of momentum in the products that we've got. So I feel very good about the business. I think the only thing you should interpret in the widening of the range is, just a little bit more, hey, yes, it could be plus or minus 1% versus plus or minus 0.5% last year.","Ben Jackson","And, Brian, I'll pick up on the RFQ, ETF hub questions that you had. So on RFQ, we have that capability now. So in your question you said, is that going to be coming later this year? You have to remember, from being a long-time exchange, clearinghouse market operator in a number of different asset classes, we have expertise in the RFQ auction space in many of our markets. So we leverage a lot of that expertise and we're able to get those RFQ capabilities established on both BondPoint and TMC very rapidly.","So that capability and functionality is there now. And now it's about leveraging our network and our distribution capabilities to get that out, which we're very well able to do as we have brought those businesses together with our Creditex business, that I've mentioned, and also leveraging all of the touch points we have in the fixed-income community through our ICE Data Services business.","For the ETF hub, that will launch later this year. That's our targeted time frame with our steering committee. We have completed the requirements definition around that. We have the design well underway. We have most of the major issuers that are onboard, helping us with this, as well as the major APs and market-makers that are helping and assisting with that design. And that has enabled us to really lock that down and now we're looking at later this year. So you'll see contribution on this. We're targeting 2020.","Jeff Sprecher","And lastly, on the members exchange. I guess, I'm not aware that there's management or anybody working on anything, but that's really not their obligation to discuss it with us. But that said, if I was in their position, if I wanted to get the market fast, I'd probably just copy verbatim somebody else's rule book. And probably there's a one year-ish process, one maybe two.","Of course, if I copy somebody else's rule book, it doesn't give you anything that's unique that exists. And I would suspect that there's going to be a lot of scrutiny around the very issue that many pundits are talking about which is -- are the members going to try to bias their business towards the exchange, rather than seek the best price for their customers in the marketplace.","And that come along way in the last few years in terms of disclosure and audit ability of that behavior. But it's not completely done yet. So I suspect there'll be a fair amount of conversation and review of just how is order flow intended to be routed. All that said, nothing moves fast in the regulatory world. And I can tell you that I'm watching Bakkt try to stand up its regulatory footprint. And things are not moving necessarily fast right now in the United States.","Operator","The last question for today will come from Chris Allen of Compass Point. Please go ahead.","Chris Allen","Good morning, guys. I think most of my questions have gone answered. I just had a quick numbers question. Just on the other revenues, which are boosted by $5 million in fines in 3Q, up sequentially again in 4Q. I'm just kind of wondering what's been driving that over the course of the year and kind of the outlook there?","Scott Hill","So the other revenue Chris is where we've got the revenues associated actually with the interest we earned on our clearing house deposit. And so as the fed has moved rates up and the balances have grown and they tend to grow at year-end people like to part cash at our clearing houses at year-end. That's what drove it up.","And so depending on what the rate environment is as we move through 2019, you could see a similar dynamic. If rates were constant, it will all correlate to the actual levels of collateral, cash collateral specifically that to some that's held at our clearing house. Nothing, more than that.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Sprecher for any closing remarks.","Jeff Sprecher","Thank you, Kerry. Thank you all for joining us on the call and we look forward to really a guided up-year again for 2019, and we'll talk to you in the next quarter.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a great day."],"11842":["Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) Q1 2015 Earnings Call May  5, 2015  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Kelly L.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Kelly Loeffler. Please go ahead.","Kelly L. Loeffler","[indiscernible] first quarter 2015 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of theice.com. These items will be archived, and our call will be available for replay.","Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our Form 10-K.","In addition to GAAP results, we also refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including adjusted net income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted expenses, adjusted EPS and adjusted tax rate. We believe these non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance.","You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP term in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful as well as how management uses these measures.","When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction based expenses, adjusted net income refers to adjusted net income from continuing operations, and adjusted earnings refer to adjusted diluted continuing operations earnings per share.","With us on the call are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Chuck Vice, President and Chief Operating Officer.","I'll now turn the call over to Scott.","Scott A. Hill","Thank you, Kelly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning.","I'll begin on Slide 4, which highlights our first quarter performance, the best quarter in our company's history. We grew adjusted earnings 26% year-to-year by growing revenues 7% and expanding adjusted operating margins to 60%. Our commodities, data services and listings offerings all contributed to solid top line growth.","We extended NYSE's leadership in capital raising and increased share in revenue capture and cash equity. We demonstrated continued expense discipline as the benefits of our rapid integration of Liffe and the New York Stock Exchange flowed through to the bottom line. And importantly, even as we invested in future growth, we also returned $269 million of capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends.","Moving to Slide 5. I'll detail our first quarter financial results. Adjusted earnings rose 26% from the prior first quarter to a record $3.06. Net revenues grew 7% year-over-year to $850 million, including record revenues for data services and for NYSE listing. Adjusted operating expenses declined 4% year-over-year to $336 million, and adjusted operating margin reached 60%. And we've generated operating cash flow of $465 million.","Now let's turn to Slide 6, where I'll provide more detail on our revenues and expenses. On the left side of the slide, you can see that net transaction and clearing revenues grew 2% year-to-year to $506 million. This was enabled by an 11% increase in commodity revenues on the strength of our global oil markets.","Our non-transaction revenues, which comprise 40% of net revenues, grew 15%. Within non-transaction revenues, our data services revenues grew 19% to a record $187 million. This was driven by the addition of hundreds of new users of ICE's real-time market data as well as the addition of SuperDerivatives and ICE Benchmark Administration.","NYSE listings revenues grew 12% year-to-year to a record $101 million, reflecting the NYSE's global leadership in IPOs over the past 4 years.","Finally, U.S. cash and equities options revenues declined 1% year-over-year to $82 million. Cash equities market share, revenue capture and revenues increased, but this strong performance was offset by an increasingly competitive equity options market and structural changes we are making.","Importantly, despite the lower options revenues, the profit contribution from the options business was not impacted.","On the right side of Slide 6, I'll detail our expenses. First quarter adjusted expenses declined 4% to $336 million as we continue to generate synergies. Technology and D&A expense increased slightly from the prior first quarter due to investments to further integrate our acquisitions and to consolidate our real estate footprint in our major locations. This was more than offset by a 40% reduction in professional services as we continue to reduce the significant reliance on consultants and contractors at NYSE.","While some contractors were converted to full-time employees, comp and benefit expense still decreased by 2%. The combination of solid revenue growth and continued expense disciplines produced an adjusted operating margin of 60%.","Next, on Slide 7, I'll detail the performance across our futures exchanges for the first quarter. Despite low volatility in volumes, which decreased 7%, open interest rose 4% from the start of the year. Total futures and options revenues grew 3% from the prior first quarter to $369 million, driven by record volume in our Brent and other oil products.","Brent revenues grew 51% year-to-year to a record $74 million. Brent continues to expand its lead as the global benchmark for pricing crude and refined oil products, with open interest up 15% from year-end to a record 4.4 million contracts. Notably, Brent open interest is up 49% from last March, with strong growth due to the ongoing shift of Brent in commodity indexes and longer-term secular trends.","This growth continued in April, with daily volume in our global oil markets up 21% over last April and Brent open interest again reaching a new record.","Natural gas revenue increased 4% over last year's first quarter to $58 million, driven by strong growth in our European gas market, which offset muted North American natural gas volatility.","Interest rate revenues were $56 million, down 30% over the prior first quarter due to continued low interest rate policies in Europe. However, our revenue capture across all of our categories, energy, ag and financials, improved year-to-year and provided a solid foundation for revenue growth across our diverse set of product offerings.","Finally, despite overall volume declines in April, strong commodities volumes, combined with continued strength in data and listings, enabled solid revenue growth again in April.","Moving to Slide 8, I'll provide an update on our swaps markets and clearing. Total credit derivatives revenues for the quarter were $43 million, flat compared to last year's first quarter. CDS clearing revenues were $29 million, including an additional $3 million accrual related to a change in our deferred revenue calculation.","Growth in buyside participation continued, which accounted for 37% of the gross notional cleared in the quarter in our U.S. CDS clearinghouse, ICE Clear Credit. We also continue to see strong European buyside activity in our U.S. clearinghouse, with European activity accounting for roughly 40% of total buyside gross notional cleared.","Buyside participation in our U.S. CDS clearinghouse has grown rapidly over the past 2 years. This is due, in part, to our comprehensive product offering and portfolio margining as well as the relative regulatory certainty in the U.S. We are continuing to expand our cleared instruments to serve our customers as they adapt to regulatory change.","I'll wrap up my remarks on Slide 9 with an update of our cash flows, capital structure and capital return. Operating cash flows were $465 million in the first quarter. This included $272 million collected related to annual listing fee payment and the payment of $104 million for the cash portion of our 2014 performance bonus.","At March 31, we had $776 million in net unrestricted cash and short-term investments. Included in that cash balance is $187 million of additional regulatory capital that will be required when ICE Clear Europe becomes EMIR-authorized.","Net debt was $3.2 billion, and our adjusted debt to EBITDA was 1.6x. In addition to reducing our leverage, we used our strong cash generation during the quarter to return $269 million to shareholders, comprised of $73 million in dividend and $196 million in share repurchases.","Importantly, our Board of Directors approved a 15% increase in our cash dividend to $0.75 per share, which will be effective with the second quarter dividend payment in June.","Our board also approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization in April, and we have over $500 million remaining on that authorization.","Going forward, we expect to maintain approximately $500 million in operational cash and a leverage ratio of around 1.5x. We otherwise intend to use 100% of our future cash flows to invest in our business and return capital to shareholders.","Starting in 2016, we anticipate a more normalized level of capital expenditures between $150 million and $200 million. In addition, we will continue to execute strategic M&A that generates above -- returns above our cost to capital. Importantly, we expect to continue to return a meaningful level of capital to shareholders through our ongoing and disciplined share repurchases and the dividend that grows when we do.","We are off to a solid start in 2015 and are continuing to execute on our financial and strategic objectives. We grew revenue 7% and adjusted earnings 26% and returned $269 million in capital to shareholders even as we continue to integrate multiple acquisitions and invest in future growth.","The purposeful diversification of our revenue streams and access to secular growth trends position us to again generate double-digit earnings growth and strong returns for our shareholders in 2015.","I'll be happy to answer any questions during Q&A, and I'll now hand the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Thank you, Scott, and good morning to everyone on the call. Our record revenue and earnings were the result of revenue growth across the board, expense discipline and rising operating margins. Each of our major product lines, execution in clearing, data and listings, whether transaction or recurring revenue, made a contribution to our 26% adjusted earnings growth during the quarter.","To continue to grow and innovate, we have a number of long-term strategic initiatives and near-term profit drivers, several of which are listed on Slide 10. These are designed to foster ongoing revenue growth, operational enhancements, margin expansion and effective capital deployment.","We started with just one asset class, energy, and then strategically diversified into 9 asset classes. As a result, we have additional opportunities to grow and to innovate in related areas like new products, clearing, data and listings.","This includes our cash equities markets, where we have solidly increased results from both a market share and revenue capture perspective while enhancing our operations and our technology. We're developing our new trading platform known as Pillar for the New York Stock Exchange to consolidate 5 platforms into 1 state-of-the-art platform. This will support a streamlined market model, which will reduce complexity for our customers while also reducing our operating costs.","You could see that we're investing in our listings business and our cash equities markets, both of which have grown revenues double digits in the last 2 quarters and are generating very solid returns.","Our reach across the global financial and commodities markets has also created opportunities to innovate and expand our data services. We've established a growing benchmark administration group to answer the call for regulated, transparent benchmarks, building on the LIBOR and ISDAFIX mandates that we began last year.","Our acquisition of SuperDerivatives added to our expertise in complex derivatives valuation and supports our expansion of clearing services with proprietary data as Europe's clearing requirements come into effect in the coming year.","In the meantime, we're developing more product choices, such as our Eris futures contract for CDS and European interest rates.","Similarly, the regulatory environment continues to drive both challenges and opportunities.","In Europe, ongoing financial reform is creating uncertainty for our customers, from end users to financial institutions. We and other market operators have seen shifts in our customers' preference on where they choose to manage risk in the swaps and futures markets away from Europe and toward the U.S., validating our investment decision to operate multiple regional venues on common technology.","And while regulation is creating uncertainty, complexity and potentially, market fragmentation, it also presents an opportunity to help our customers efficiently adapt to this change.","Similarly, Asia's markets are expanding due to greater demand for the type of products we currently offer through our Western exchanges and clearinghouses.","Our work there is foundational, and we will launch ICE Futures Singapore and ICE Clear Singapore this year. We're seeing a good deal of interest in our newly announced Asian market products and for the increased access to central clearing.","We had a presence in Singapore for many years, and we're continuing to work closely with our customers there.","So as you can see, we have many long-term opportunities before us. And here, we've also noted several of our near-term earning drivers. We remain levered to strong secular trends, ranging from global energy market hedging to the demand for clearing and data services, which continue to drive growth across our customer base.","As a part of our ongoing integration work, we're making great progress on our expense synergy objectives. And we're continuing to look across the company to ensure that we are operating efficiently. This is something we do well, continuously looking at the best use of our resources and creating cost efficiencies even as we grow.","These are all key elements of our strategic plan to ensure that we remain a growth company.","I'll provide more detail on a few of ICE's markets now beginning on Slide 11. First, our leading global energy markets. The ICE Brent contract continues to advance as the global oil benchmark and set volume and open interest records. Brent is benefiting from long-term secular trends that has driven consistent open interest records and is betting from near-term trends the ongoing price volatility, which has resulted in record volume.","ICE Brent, together with the introduction of over 400 related oil products, has enabled us to continue to grow our broad complex of oil products through economic cycles.","This includes ICE's WTI contract, where daily volume grew 57% year-to-year in the quarter. And in January, we completed the transition of our distillate market to our new gas oil futures contract specification, providing a greater range of hedging opportunities in the global diesel markets. As a result, the ICE gas oil daily volume increased 17% year-to-year in the first quarter.","Also, on the slide, you can see our U.S. natural gas market strengthen relative to the prior 3 quarters. During the first quarter of last year, the U.S. was feeling the effects of the polar vortex, and the volatility of natural gas prices was very strong. As a result, our first quarter 2015 natural gas volumes declined 10% versus the tough comparisons of last year. However, this trading volume doesn't tell our revenue story.","Due to an increasingly favorable product mix, ICE's global natural gas revenues actually increased 4%, driven by strong growth in our non-U.S. natural gas markets.","Now moving on to Slide 12, I'll update you on our European interest rates complex. Ongoing near 0 interest rate levels in the eurozone impacted volatility and, therefore, impacted the trading volume across our interest rate complex. However, we've seen a healthy increase in open interest, which is generally a good indicator of future trading volumes.","Total open interest in interest rates increased 11% in the first quarter, with Euribor up 17% and Sterling and Gilt both up 7%.","We expect to introduce ERIS-style futures for European interest rates in June as a solution to offer capital efficiencies amid the implementation of bank capital rules and other market reforms.","So you can see that we are building out our interest rate portfolio to provide all of the necessary tools to mitigate risk and maximize capital efficiencies as we prepare for European interest rate volatility.","Turning to Slide 13, I'll note the solid growth trend in our data services businesses. By combining ICE's historical data with the data that we acquired and reorganized from the New York Stock Exchange, Liffe and SuperDerivatives, we've expanded the markets that we cover. Together with our newly formed benchmark administration company, this has allowed us to develop a broader portfolio of information services for our global customer base.","In the first quarter, we earned record data revenues. And over the course of the last 2 years, we have quadrupled our data services revenues. This is a result of providing an expanding range of data to a growing range of customers across all geographies and asset classes.","At ICE Benchmark Administration, in March, the ICE Swap Rate replaced the ISDAFIX, and we successfully launched the gold price with record-level participation. We've also undertaken market consultations for both LIBOR and the LBMA Gold Prices to evolve the best practices for determining these prices.","Now on Slide 14, I'll highlight the solid momentum that we are driving in the New York Stock Exchange listings and our improving cash equity markets. The New York Stock Exchange continued to lead in global capital raising, with $50 billion in total proceeds raised in the first quarter. This is more than the next 2 largest exchanges combined. And we continue to attract companies of all sectors and market capitalizations because of our unique market model, combined with our unparalleled visibility and service.","All of this drove record listings revenues surpassing $100 million, up 12% over last year's first quarter. We're excited about the strong pipeline of transactions that we see for 2015. And we continue to raise the bar as the global listings venue across technology markets and other growth sectors.","I'll conclude my remarks on Slide 15 with a recap of the absolute best quarter in our company's history. We delivered record revenues, record operating income and record earnings. We expanded adjusted operating margins to 60%, delivered on our expense synergy forecast and made disciplined investments, all of which drove our adjusted earnings per share growth an impressive 26% over last year's first quarter.","We've returned nearly $1.3 billion to shareholders since we began our first dividend payment just 16 months ago. And today, we also announced a 15% increase to our quarterly dividend.","I'm pleased to conclude my prepared comments on this Slide 15, where we continued to demonstrate that ICE is a growth company, delivering earnings per share growth in every full year since we became a public company across a wide range of market and regulatory challenges that our customers have faced over the last decade.","Our company remains focused on innovating to solve the challenges that are faced by our customers, whether hedging, raising capital or complying with regulatory reform.","On behalf of everyone at ICE, I want to thank our customers for trusting us with their business and for collaborating on their evolving requirements during this very dynamic time.","I'll now ask our operator, Andrew, to conduct the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First, on the competitive landscape, ICE built a business by challenging the establishment. And I guess with New York Stock Exchange, you are, in part, part of the establishment. So as I think about New York Stock Exchange, how do you -- what is the -- how are you defending against encroachment by new entrants? And can you defend your strategy to defend the business? So in particular, I'm looking at 2 things. One is the options business, which you mentioned in the prepared remarks, but Miami and BATS are taking share and seem to be leveraging the changes that have been made at Amex. And then on the ETF business, BATS is making a big push, has hired away some NYSE alums to grow that business. So the question again, how are you defending your position as the incumbent? And why is that the right approach?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Very good question. So let me start maybe with the options business first. We have, in a very disciplined way, decided to not participate in options volume that does not earn a return for the company. And so people love to talk about market share, but I ended on Slide 15 where we talk about earnings per share growth for our shareholders. And so we are very -- in a very calculated manner, trying to raise the operational performance of the NYSE and its related businesses by curating what we do there. So the fact that we send uncompetitive business to our competitors is to not concern our shareholders, they should be happy. And let's let those competitors have the bragging rights if they have a lot of market share, but there isn't a lot of income to go along with some of that business. With respect to ETFs and the trading of stocks, we're investing heavily in the New York Stock Exchange. We think that there's an incredible opportunity for return on invested capital above our costs by putting money in there. We have actually opened a new trading floor on the New York Stock Exchange, which I don't think people are aware of. People like to talk about us selling the business or closing the floor. We've actually put more money down there. We've invested in the infrastructure of our building. We're investing in advocacy for -- on behalf of listed companies, organized events for listed companies, marketing for us and listed companies. And what you've seen is, as a result of that, we've really been able to grow our listings business, both in companies going public and ETFs. We find that there are -- that companies want to affiliate with us. They want to be part of that organization. They want to identify with our brand. They want to take that globally. And so I just continue to see opportunities to invest. We are the premium brand around the world for capital raising, and we prove it quarter-after-quarter since we've owned this company. The fact that somebody wants to go start a discount franchise and what I view as tarnish brands and not earn income for their shareholders the way we want to do above our cost of capital, it's fine, and it's business. But that -- we're happy to have that kind of competition. I don't fear it. I welcome it. And by the way, Ken, I rarely welcome any kind of competition. And so I truly mean that.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then secondly, on the regulatory landscape, what is most top-of-mind for ICE today? And where does ICE need to either invest the most time or what is most important in terms of rules and regions to make sure the ICE point of view is expressed to regulators to get the right result for the market?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, I think we're simultaneously spending a fair amount of time both in Europe and the U.S. The EMIR and MIFID laws have been passed, but the details have not been promulgated. And in the U.S., Dodd-Frank has been passed, but all the details have not been promulgated. And the biggest issue for us is making sure that the Western regulators move somewhat in concert with each other and not create regulatory arbitrage or barriers to business. Now as you know, we've invested regionally in order to have infrastructure in case that were to happen. And we think that was a prudent way to place the company so that we can grow regardless. But that being said, it's really, really important to us that we see regulation move together. So we moved back and forth between the 2 continents, providing data and details that we hope regulators will take under their wing. I will tell you that we see tremendous dialogue and conversation at the top levels of government in the U.K., Continental Europe and the U.S. to try to move together. So this is something that is top-of-mind for senior people in government. And we're trying to create a supportive role to point out various details with the policies that they're thinking about. I think we've been very successful. There are others doing this. There's -- it's kind of an industry collaboration in many regards. But I would tell you that we feel much better about the state of play on this earnings call than we felt on past earnings calls because we really see attempts by regulators to make this happen in a cohesive and organized manner.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Carrier from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sameer Murukutla - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Sameer Murukutla for Mike Carrier. Just on the regulatory topic, can you provide an update on the disagreements between the U.S. and Europe still? And as a follow-up, can you speak about the Basel rules and the pressures that the current set of rules create on FDMs and the Basel impact this might have on your business and maybe any resolution that you see in the works?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Sure. Look, I'll take the first half of that question. Actually, we really do see a lot of meetings going on, and we've been providing a lot of collateral material, background information, hard data to the U.S. and European regulators and politicians. And it does feel like -- and you've probably seen press reports if you follow this area that suggest that these guys are very close to trying to find a way to harmonize and, in fact, do it in a way that is relatively similar, not just somewhat equivalent but really trying to get rid of loopholes so that the Western countries can set an example for the rest of the world on how to bring regulation together. So we are cautiously optimistic that the landscape is unfolding in a way that is beneficial to our customers and their ability to do business around the world. Let me ask Scott, who oversees our clearing operations, to take the second half of that.","Scott A. Hill","Yes. With regards to Basel and the capital rules more generally, there's no question that the financial institutions, the clearing members that are part of our clearinghouses are under an immense amount of pressure from all of the various capital rules. And that's one of the reasons why you see us continuing to work on things like portfolio margining at our CDS clearinghouse, offering new products at all of our clearinghouses, whether it's interest rates or energy, trying to generate capital efficiencies. It's one of the reasons why we've been out publicly, saying that we would contemplate adding more skin in the game because that is a way of reducing some of the capital pressures on the banks. Historically, one of the reasons why ICE has been successful is we worked with our customers to understand their pain points and to try and come up with solutions to alleviate that pain. And the capital restrictions are one of them. You mentioned Basel specifically. It's somewhat counterintuitively, the Basel rule around capital in Europe is interpreted that the margin that the clearing members collect from their end customers is not risk-reducing. And in fact, in the U.S., that rule has been interpreted that it's actually risk-increasing and ignores the fact that those margins are passed straight through to the clearinghouse, and the banks really can't leverage them in any way. So we're participating, along with the clearing members, in the dialogue with the regulators, as Jeff said earlier, to make sure that we do get to a more rational place in terms of the rules. We all understand that the capital requirements are going up, not just for the financial institutions but for our clearinghouses as well. We now have around $600 million of regulatory capital and skin in the game, largely associated with the clearinghouses. But capital constraints are definitely an issue with the clearing members, and we're spending a lot of time with them and regulators, trying to get that to a better place.","Operator","The next question comes from Kenneth Hill from Barclays.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So I wanted to start with the 15% increase to the dividend. I'm wondering if you could walk through some of the thought process there and maybe any conversations with investors that led to the increase because it seems like it kind of puts you at a place where you're not quite screening as a strong dividend company. So I'm wondering where that could probably go over time and maybe how you compare that versus repurchases longer term.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","It's a good question. So I think Scott mentioned in his prepared remarks that our view is that as we grow the earnings of the company, we should be growing the dividend. And if we're doing a good job as managers, we will constantly be growing earnings, and we will constantly be growing the dividend. And we've just sort of gotten started, if you will, as being a dividend-paying company. And we're proud of the fact that we've pretty quickly now started to increase the dividend. In terms of how we allocate capital, which is really at the root of your question, we think our buying back our stock right now is the best opportunity for growth for our shareholders. I mean, if you look at ICE this quarter, we did $850 million in revenues. Our nearest competitor did $843 million. So we virtually sat on top of each other. Our competitor in earnings did something like $330 million, but there was $10 million of FX in there. So for talking purposes, let me call it $320 million. And we did $315 million, virtually sitting right on top of each other. Our nearest competitor grew 15%. We grew 26%. And we see a pathway for continued growth that is much easier for us than for our competitor. Yet our stock trades at a P\/E or PEG ratio discount to the -- to our competitors. So it looks to us like our stock is a very good buy. That's what our internal analysis shows. We have other competitors that are actually x growth that have a higher P\/E. We have people that are in our space that operate businesses that are simply execution platforms with complete -- fungible clearing that trade at a higher P\/E. And yet we are -- you can look at Slide 15 and see we are a growth company, and we don't think that our stock is priced accordingly, and so we're buying it back. And I think long term, we'll be proven to be right on that. And so it's made the decision that you've asked about inside the boardroom relatively easy on how we bias our capital spending right now.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Next one, the follow-up here is on kind of the relaunch of the credit futures contract. Just wondering how you're seeing customers approach the product versus maybe your more traditional CDS clearing business and what's causing a customer to choose maybe one or the other, whether it's the cost or the index followed or the way that cash flows are replicated, just wondering if you could help us think through how the swap futures growth and maybe with the launch of the new futures product, how we can think about that.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Sure. Really, the backdrop is going back to the earlier question that Scott fielded. The capital rules on banks and clearers are -- and now increasingly on our customers through the margins that are being charged -- are pretty significant. And by regulation in U.S. and in Europe and Asia, illiquid swaps contracts have to have a clearinghouse assume a 5-day liquidation period. So there's a 5-day -- the mathematical models have a 5-day holding period. Liquid futures contracts are 1-day gross or 2-day net, something in that range. And so to the extent that we can take the liquid part of what exists in the swaps market and make it trade as liquid futures, it will be much cheaper, much less capital tied up in the industry. And that's why people are looking at this and thinking about it. We're very, very early days right now. We have a lot of work to do with the industry to get that futures contract distributed through the desktops and the back-office systems that swap traders historically use. And there's a big industry push and conversation going on about getting this particular contract listed. This one has much more interest in it than when we tried it 2 years ago. And I think the environment has moved forward, these capital pressures have moved forward, and the design of the contract is one that people understand better than what we tried before. So we're cautiously optimistic. It's early days, but the underlying business case for the standardization of the liquid part of the swaps curve is there.","Operator","The next question comes from Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I guess the first question is on the non-transaction revenue, on the data service fees as well as the listing fees. So Scott, you -- the 10% up year-over-year guidance, it looked we're already at that run rate. So I guess the question is, where do you see these lines trending? And that's even with the SuperDerivatives in it. Where do you see the lines trending? Is that guidance pretty conservative right now? And any breakouts you can give in regards to benchmark administration, contribution, et cetera, I think, would be helpful.","Scott A. Hill","Yes. I'm not going to break down the bits and pieces too much, Rich. But I'll help a little bit on the trend. We had guided at the end of last year that data revenues and listings revenues were going to be strong. We expected to come out of the gate strong as we did in the first quarter. And frankly, as I look to the rest of the year, I think the second, third, fourth quarter are going to look a lot like the first quarter. And if you look on a year-over-year basis, that's going to mean solid year-over-year growth in listings and data every single quarter the rest of the year.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Yes, Rich. We -- Scott mentioned in his prepared remarks, hopefully, it didn't go unnoticed, that we are amazed that we've had hundreds of new users come to our dataset. This is a real growth story for us, and it's happened quite quickly. Our team has done a really good job out in the field, bringing our data to new customers. And the pipeline for listings looks really strong for the next -- the visibility we have into the rest of the year. So we feel pretty good about true growth coming from new users.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I guess we're going to see whether Scott's 10% up is conservative or not then. I guess my follow-up would be -- and you didn't -- the same -- what you said, Jeff, in your prepared remarks is consistent with what we are hearing from the FCMs that there's a shift away from the U.K. banks, and there's more business moving to the U.S., I guess, U.S. banks. And then so I guess the question is, we now look at the equivalence issue as the -- probably the near-term biggest regulatory issue. But let's assume that gets compromised, have you -- as you've sort of referred to or hinted at. But this movement of customers, I -- is this, do you think, just temporary, and once the regulations get in place -- or is the regulatory framework over there just going to be different where some of these changes might be permanent? And I guess I'm asking this because of the open access issue over there, a shift to the U.S. would, I think, be in your benefit, if I'm correct.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, it's a good question. First of all, I'm not sure that a shift to the U.S. is in our benefit. We are very, very well positioned in Europe and are making real investments there to take advantage of changes that are going on. So there may be slightly different models in different regions, but we want to maximize our profitability in each of those regions. The other interesting thing that really, it's a follow-on to what you mentioned that you've been seeing is there's also a lot of capital moving towards Asia. I mean, you see it in the demand right now for the linkage between the Hong Kong Exchange and the Shanghai Stock Exchange in equities. But there is capital flowing towards Asia for commodities, derivatives and other things. So it's very, very hard for us to predict where the markets will go. Right after Dodd-Frank passed, if you were to listen to the conversation, you would have thought people were going to leave the U.S. because they didn't like Dodd-Frank. Now we see this opposite impact where people are moving business to the U.S. and seem to be more comfortable with Dodd-Frank. There are still parts of regulations like -- that affect our customers like position limits and additional capital rules and other things that are yet to be promulgated. So this may be temporary. We don't know. That's why we basically wanted to be pretty diverse, and that's why I feel very good that we've got the right tools to continue our -- on our earnings growth trajectory because we're very well positioned in each of these venues.","Operator","The next question comes from Chris Allen of Evercore.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore ISI, Research Division","Just want to follow up real quickly on Rich's question. You mentioned that 2Q versus 4 -- through 4Q would look a lot like 1Q for the market data and listings. Were you referring to growth or the actual revenue numbers? Because the growth...","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Actual revenue numbers.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore ISI, Research Division","Actual revenue numbers, okay. Just wanted to clarify that. And then, Jeff, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned natural gas. You're seeing a big pickup or a big growth in non-U.S. Is that just concentrated in Europe or you're seeing it more broadly than Europe right now? I'm just kind of looking for more color there.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Yes. It's mostly Europe although the interest level of -- as capital is deployed looking for natural gas around the world, it seems to be moving away from the U.S. towards other areas. And the big global companies that we're very close to are looking all around the world. So at this point, it tends to be parts of Europe, but I -- we're really setting the company up to be a global gas franchise.","Operator","The next question comes from Alex Kramm of UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Sorry to come back to this one more time. But I would love for you to flush out this non-transaction, I guess, call it guidance a little bit more because on the one hand, you're saying you're adding users, and you're very excited. On the one hand, you say revenue is flattish for the rest of the year. And maybe a couple of items there to point to. In particular, on the benchmark side, it seems like LIBOR, you just really got started. There was a lot of industry pushback. So maybe just flush out where you are in terms of what inning, in terms of actually charging everyone and then making sure everybody's paying. And then maybe on the other side of the coin, like, how much of that line item is actually driven by things like market data, fee pool, the NYSE, things that maybe are not driving as much as they should be, and maybe that's where that flattish is coming from.","Scott A. Hill","Yes. So I'll take exception to the flattish. So what I'm suggesting is that hundreds of new users, ICE Benchmark, SuperDerivatives, all of those things contributed to a really strong first quarter and will continue to contribute as we move through the year. So if you look at each of the quarters, even at current first quarter levels through the rest of the year, that's very solid year-over-year revenue growth, right in line with the guidance that we gave on our last earnings call. Clearly, ICE Benchmark Administration is in early days. And so we would fully expect that business to contribute more as we move through the year. The user growth that we've seen, that's in the first quarter numbers and reflected and will continue to flow through as revenue as we move through the year. SuperDerivatives, again, fully embedded, full quarter in the first quarter, will continue to flow through during the year. So what I'm suggesting is a constant trend through the year with significant year-over-year increases. Again, just do the math based on what we had for data last year and listings last year, relative to what we had in terms of absolute revenues in the first quarter.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","And Alex, maybe to get at the root of your question a little more, we saw hundreds of new users in the -- just in the commodity space. We have a much better offering now where we can go to commodity traders and offer a wider suite of data that takes in data that we've got through SuperDerivatives and through NYSE and Liffe but targeted towards commodity traders. And so there is real growth. And the idea that we have, which is we could become a better data company, have been playing out in the usage.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then secondly, maybe just coming back to the NYSE integration, which we haven't really touched upon so far today, so I think some people were probably cautiously optimistic that you, like, give a little bit more color on how synergies are progressing and maybe see some upside. So just wondering how you feel about integration, if there are any big projects you're making any good headway on and maybe get excited about seeing more things than you originally anticipate or just -- how you feel about the integration overall.","Scott A. Hill","I feel really good about the integration. I mean, look at the first quarter. Expenses are down 4%, and that's despite the fact that we added 300 employees through the acquisition of SuperDerivatives and Holland Clearing House and the other businesses we acquired. Compensation despite that was down 2% year-over-year. Professional services, down 40% year-over-year. Margins at 60%, which I'll grant you is on a very strong revenue quarter, that notwithstanding revenues grow 7%, expenses come down 4%. All of that's enabled because of the tremendous progress that we've made in our overall integration efforts. It -- I think what gets taken for granted a little bit is that the fourth quarter was well under where we had guided because we had accelerated those synergies in. And we saw continued reduction if you look 4Q to 1Q in terms of the expense performance. So I think the margin expansion that you're seeing, I think the expense trends that you're seeing, all of those are reflective of the strong integration that's occurred thus far, and there'll be more to come as we move through the year. I mean, expenses will be relatively consistent as you move to 2Q and 3Q. But then as you move into 4Q, some of the initiatives we've got going around real estate and some additional corporate function integration that we're working our way through, you'll start see the expenses come down a little bit again as we get towards the end of the year and as we move through into next year.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","And Alex, the -- we have really become known for delivering good technology. Chuck Vice, our President, and his team are driving a lot of change inside the NYSE. I mentioned in my remarks that we're moving from 5 trading platforms to 1, our new Pillar system. That will be cost savings. We are building new state-of-the-art compliance and oversight systems using our heavy technology investment in bringing then FINRA-type services in-house where I think we're going to provide much higher-quality, more real-time services at lower cost. And I think you'll see us continue and we are continuing to invest in the technology around our listings systems and the way we talk to our listed companies. So all of that technology spend will ultimately simplify that business and allow us to deliver higher-quality services at lower costs. So really good return on invested capital there that you'll see as we go through '16, I believe.","Operator","The next question comes from Dan Fannon of Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions on capital. Scott, I think you mentioned $500 million of operational cash. Curious if that's a change or just similar to what it's been. And then it's clear, your comments around the buybacks and kind of how you view your stock currently. But also, I would just like to get an update on the M&A environment and kind of how you're thinking about that and the opportunities there or how much time you're spending on that today.","Scott A. Hill","Yes. No, good -- yes. So the $500 million, Dan, what we've historically said is we'd be somewhere in the $500 million to $600 million range. I think as our capital structure continues to improve, as our access to debt markets continues to improve, that we've come to the determination that the lower end of that range is where we can comfortably manage from a cash balance. So in the range but on the lower end. In terms of the overall M&A environment and how we think about it, it's not too different. Jeff, in his prepared remarks and in an earlier Q&A, really hit on the key for us, which is we continue to focus on opportunities for growth. M&A enables that, but we only are willing to look at deals where we can generate returns on invested capital that are above our cost of capital. Just to give you a sense, if you -- our projection of where we will be by the time we get to the end of this year is we'll have our returns on invested capital back above our cost of capital, and that's going to be within 2 years of closing the NYSE deal. When you consider the size of that acquisition, that's a pretty quick turnaround. You look at other competitors in the space that have spent a similar amount on acquisitions that have the return above -- invested capital above their cost of capital ever, and we're going to be back there by the end of this year. So that's how we think about M&A. Do the deals generate growth? But more importantly, do they generate, to Jeff's last chart, growth in earnings? And to the extent they do, do they generate returns on invested capital above cost of capital? That's the objective. In terms of the environment and how much time we spend, it's pretty consistent. Again, we constantly look at new opportunities for growth, whether it's a small deal like YellowJacket years ago to get into options technology, a transformative deal like the New York Stock Exchange to move into the interest rate business. We look at a range of deals all the time and go through it in a very disciplined manner to make sure it's a strategic fit, and it's a financial -- it's attractive financially.","Operator","The next question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A question for you guys on the operating leverage. I think maybe a year ago or so ago, Scott, you outlined kind of the longer-term margin goals for the business or kind of just saying, look, steady state, even if revenues don't grow, given everything we're doing, margins could be well into the 60% zone. Clearly, you guys had a little bit of reporting change, but also the business is growing quite nicely. And you guys have, I think, taken out more expenses than, I think, some of us thought. So","I was just wondering, steady state today, where could that margin go, again, kind of flattish revenue growth, which, of course, may not be the case, but just kind of given the growth opportunities on the -- and the trajectory of expenses, hoping to get an update on net margin.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Yes. Look, it's difficult to project margin because implicit in that is a projection on revenues. But I think if you look back at what we told you, and again, I appreciate that there's been the reporting change. But add 3 points to that chart in each period, and you're right around where that trend would be. If you look at where we are in the first quarter, again, on strong revenues, we're ahead of that trend. If you look over the course of the year, I think we're tracking right where we thought we would in terms of margin expansion. We do believe that the business can continue to track ahead as we take costs out, as we grow the top line. So again, I'm not going to predict margins 1 quarter out, 3 quarters, 2 years out. But we're on the right trend. We're seeing the expansion we expected. And I absolutely think there's an expectation that margins will continue to expand, and no reason to think we can't get back to levels similar to what we had before the NYSE deal.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, makes sense. And just a quick follow-up on capital management. Can you talk a little bit, I guess, about your appetite to use some of the -- either your credit facility or revolver to accelerate some of the buybacks, just taking into account Jeff's comments and obviously your points around how strong the capital position is of the company today. You're around that 1.5, 1.6x debt to EBITDA, and EBITDA is going to grow, which is by the virtue of expenses going lower. So can you kind of walk us through that rationale?","Scott A. Hill","Yes. Look, right now, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're -- we feel very good about where we've gotten in a very short amount of time. We've got a very strong cash balance. Our leverage at 1.6x is effectively where we expect it to be. We have the flexibility now with our access to debt markets that we don't need to build up cash in order to do a deal or to pay a dividend. And so again, I think as is typically the case, what you should expect of us going forward is what you've seen from us historically. We're going to allocate capital as we said. We've grown our dividend now. We will continue to grow it. When we grow, we have continued to buy back shares. If you look historically, we've bought back pretty opportunistically. Here, you'll note that it's been a pretty consistent amount because as Jeff said, the share price, where it is right now makes a lot of sense to us as a high return on investment. And so I don't think you're going to see us lever up to go and accelerate anything. I think again, what you ought to expect from us is consistency in terms of what you've seen in the recent quarters and in terms of our forward guidance on the dividend and the increase of 15% there.","Operator","And the last question due to time constraints would be Chris Harris from Wells Fargo.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A quick follow-up on M&A. Do MiFID and EMIR change the way you guys are approaching potential M&A opportunities in Europe? Or is it just way too early to make that call?","Scott A. Hill","Yes. I think it's way too early to make that call. I think at the end of the day, as Jeff alluded to, one of the things that we've really focused on historically as a business is building a geographically diverse business. And so we are investing in Europe. We bought the Holland Clearing House on the continent. We're investing in Singapore where we'll be launching an exchange and clearinghouse later this year. And so I think ultimately, we've done well by being geographically diverse. We've done well by understanding where regulations are going and listening to our customers in terms of where their preferences are. And so we continue to look globally at M&A. And I don't think there's any single piece of legislation or rule or regulation that, at least as we look at the landscape, would suggest to us that there's any geography that wouldn't be a prudent opportunity for investment, particularly in Europe. And again, I point to the Holland Clearing House that we just recently did.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, understood. And a quick follow-up here. Just on your RPCs, you guys have had great year-on-year growth there. You highlighted it. I know there's a lot of moving parts that go into that, mix certainly playing a role. Are there any other fees that are in your RPCs today that maybe weren't in there a year ago that's helping to drive the increase? Or is it all just mix and customers?","Scott A. Hill","No. It is largely mix and customers. And again, you kind of -- you have to peel back the onion a little bit. If you look in energy, clearly, the strength of Brent has been helping RPC in terms of energy. If you look at the agricultural market, more recently, particularly you've seen a lot of strength in the sugar markets, and our ag markets are still very much commercially oriented, the OI is building, which suggests that the commercial participants in all of the markets continue to really play a strong role. And that tends to be a help in terms of the RPC. If you switch over to the cash equities side of the business, as Jeff alluded to, we've made very conscious decisions on business we don't want that's not profitable. And as we get out of those businesses, you see RPC trends up on the cash equities and options side as well. So it is -- it's not fee increases. It is very simply customer mix and then, frankly, decisions we're making on walking away from business that doesn't generate profit for us.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO, for any closing remarks.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, thank you, all, for joining us.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Warren Gardiner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Warren Gardiner","Good morning. ICE\u2019s fourth quarter 2017 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay.","Today\u2019s call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of these risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2017 Form 10-K which we filed this morning.","In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including adjusted income, operating margin, expenses, EPS, EBITDA and tax rate. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You will find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP term in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information being meaningful as well as how management uses these measures in our Form 10-K. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share.","Also with us on the call are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and joining us for the first time and available for Q&A will be Ben Jackson, our President. I will now turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Hill","Thanks, Warren. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. I will start on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our fourth quarter. ICE\u2019s consolidated fourth quarter net revenues increased 1% to $1.1 billion. Data revenues increased 2% as reported and grew 5% on an organic constant currency basis, while trading and clearing revenues were flat versus the prior period. Adjusted operating expenses were down 3% year-over-year to $479 million and adjusted operating margins expanded to 58%.","Importantly, we delivered over $70 million in synergies in 2017 and as I will discuss later, we expect to generate around half of the remaining $60 million in synergies during 2018. The combination of top line growth and margin expansions generated fourth quarter earnings of $0.73 per share, which was up 3% from last year\u2019s fourth quarter and contributed to full year earnings growth of 6%. Our strong earnings generated nearly $2.1 billion of operating cash flow in 2017. Cash flows were down slightly from 2016, but that was primarily due to our proactive move to use $136 million to fully fund the legacy NYSE pension plan. We have now largely eliminated any future pension liability. In addition by taking the action in advance of corporate tax reform, we realized an incremental cash tax savings of nearly $20 million related to the higher federal tax rates in 2017.","We leveraged our strong cash generations to return a record $1.4 billion to our shareholders, which you can you see in more detail on Slide 5. During 2017, we repurchased $949 million of our stock at an average price of just over $63 versus the 12\/31 closing price of nearly $71. And even as we returned to record level of capital to our shareholders, we also achieved our leverage target ahead of schedule and continued to invest in both organic growth and strategic M&A, including the Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch indices, Euroclear, NGX and BondPoint. It\u2019s worth pausing to note here that the combinations of assets we have acquired and divested during 2016 and 2017 will increase our revenues by over $30 million and reduced our expenses by around $25 million in 2018 versus our pro forma 2015 results. With our profits continuing to grow and CapEx needs shrinking, 2018 sets up as another solid year for cash generation and capital return. We entered the year with $1.2 billion share repurchase authorization, which is 20% higher than our prior authorization. And this morning we announced our first quarter dividend of $0.24 per share, which is 20% higher than a year ago.","Now let\u2019s move to Slide 6 where I will discuss our data and listings segment. In the fourth quarter, segment revenues grew 5% year-over-year on an organic constant currency basis and our best in class operating margins expanded to 51%. Organic growth in our listings business was up 3% in the fourth quarter. Given our outstanding listings performance in 2017 as well as a very strong start in January, we expect organic growth in listings revenue excluding the impact of the sale of NYSE Governance Services to accelerate to 5% to 6% growth in 2018. In our data services business, organic constant currency growth was 5% in the quarter with balance growth across all business lines. Of note, fourth quarter results were reduced by around $4 million due to the sale of Trayport on December 14.","I will provide some additional insights regarding our data services business on Slide 7. We entered the first quarter of 2018 with an organic ASV is up 6% year-over-year and new signings across our pricing and analytics business that increased 12% in 2017. Importantly, roughly 40% of our 2017 pricing and analytics sales were attributable to innovative new products such as our continuous evaluated pricing services, our reference data products and our index offerings. We expect this enhanced product lineup, strong signings and high customer retentions to generate organic growth in pricing and analytics greater than 7% in 2018. This is an acceleration from 5% growth in 2017, 3.5% growth in 2016 and the 2% to 3% growth at IDC prior to our acquisition in 2015. Our thesis when we acquired IDC was that a renewed focus on customers and product innovations would significantly accelerate revenue growth. That thesis is proving out.","We are also seeing very strong growth in our connectivity and feeds business. The customers increased their capacity on our network by 20% in 2017, which contributed to revenues that grew over 7% organically for the year and we expect a double digit growth in capacity and strong revenue growth to repeat in 2018. The strong growth in pricing in analytics as well as connectivity indeed were more than offset slower growth in our exchange data and should contribute to overall organic data revenue growth consistent with the longer term outlook we provided to you at our Investor Day in June.","Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 8, where I will review our trading and clearing segment. Revenues were flat year-to-year in the fourth quarter, while segment operating margins expanded to 67%. Despite a 2% decline in average daily volume for commodities, our revenues increased by 2% year-over-year supported by a resilient RPC which benefited from favorable product mix and our commercial customer orientation. We continue to build on that growth in 2018 with January total futures and options volumes up 12% year-over-year. This growth was led by strength in interest rates which were up 28% year-over-year and ads which were up 17% year-over-year. Open interest trend also remained strong with overall OI up 12% year-over-year.","Moving next to Slide 9, you can see the positive trends across our trading and clearing segment. Average daily volume in our futures and options business increased by 10% in 2017 and this was on top of 8% growth in 2016. Our 2017 growth was led by a 15% year-over-year increase in our Brent franchise, which notched its 21st consecutive year of record volumes. Our European and UK interest rate volumes increased 28% for the highest level since 2013. More importantly, open interest across the platform increased 11% in 2017 with oil OI up 8% and rates OI up 38%. Open interest is an important indicator of customer demand and future growth across our markets. And as I just noted we are benefiting from high open interest with a solid start of the year in January and the early days of February despite some temporary uncertainty created by the implementation of MiFID II.","I will wrap up my remarks on Slide 10 with a preview of 2018. As I noted earlier in our data business, we entered 2018 with organic ASV up 6% year-over-year and strong momentum in our pricing and analytics and connectivity and feeds business. The ASV metrics combined with our consistently high customer retention, new products and improving sales efficiency supports our view that 2018 organic data revenue growth will accelerate to between 6% and 7%.","We have provided Slide 17 in the appendix to help establish the organic revenue base for 2018. The strength of our data revenues accelerated growth in our listings business as well as growing open interest in revenue capture trends in our trading and clearing segment all bodes well for another year of solid top line growth in 2018. That revenue growth coupled with margin expansion, tax reform and capital expenditures, which we expect to be down by 10% year-over-year should make 2018 another strong year for capital return. As I mentioned this morning, we announced a 20% increase in our first quarter dividend and in January we already deployed $100 million of that $1.2 billion repurchase authorization.","I will turn next to expenses. We expect expenses in the range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion for 2018. This includes $30 million of the remaining $60 million in IDC synergies. When we report our first quarter results, you will see our 2017 compensation expenses restated to reflect the change in the GAAP accounting rules related to pensions. The full year impact will increase 2017 expenses by just under $10 million and 2018 comps will be accounted for in a consistent manner. FX, as well as the small net impact from our various acquisitions and divestitures will add around $15 million in expenses in 2018, but are also expected to increase revenues by over $40 million. In addition, similar to 2017, we expect to see variable expenses which are directly associated with revenue growth increased by around $20 million. Next, we will invest $35 million to $40 million in our employees through increased merit-based compensation and cash performance bonuses in 2018.","And finally, in light of the recent change in U.S. tax laws, we expect our tax rate to fall to somewhere between 22% and 25%, which should add around $150 million to $200 million to our net income and cash flow. We intend to reinvest $30 million to $35 million of those savings during 2018 to further strengthen our cyber capabilities and our technology and operations footprint. This investment will support the development and future growth of our fixed income indices, our reference data offerings, MERS, BondPoint and our Safety network. We do not anticipate a similar level of incremental investment to be required in future years and the majority of the tax savings will still drop to the bottom line.","With that, I will be happy to take your questions during Q&A, but for now, I will turn it over to Jeff.","Jeff Sprecher","Thank you, Scott and good morning to everyone on the call. I will begin on Slide 11. 2017 marked another year of solid revenue growth, margin expansion, rising capital return and for the 12th consecutive year record adjusted earnings. We have achieved this growth through bull markets and bear markets through periods of elevated volatility and muted volatility as well as through regulatory change and ever evolving customer needs. We credit this track record of growth to a consistent vision, which is to uncover and dissolve for inefficiencies across markets, while enhancing the workflows of our customers.","As our platform has expanded, our opportunity and ability to execute on this vision has grown with it. We benefit from an execution business that now spans all major asset classes and operates across multiple jurisdictions. It\u2019s complemented by a subscription-based data business that is critical to our customers\u2019 workflows, one with a proven ability to generate consistent and compounding growth through various business cycles. Combined with our efficient cost structure, we deliver a consistent high-quality cash flow that provides us with the visibility and competence to continually invest in our future growth while increasing capital return to our shareholders.","As you can see on Slide 12, this unique model was supported by a foundation of some of the world\u2019s deepest liquidity pools in its most important markets. We operate the world\u2019s largest energy market, the largest venue for European and UK interest rate trading and we are the global leader in corporate listings. We do this by levering our 7 clearinghouses and 12 exchanges across 5 major market centers. This comprises the world\u2019s largest and most flexible trading and risk management infrastructure, which drives a comprehensive suite of data and connectivity services. Our vast infrastructure is critical to linking participants around the world to the markets and information that they require to manage risk everyday.","Moving to Slide 13, in our energy markets, we are building on our position as the premier global energy platform. Revenues in our energy business topped $900 million for the first time ever in 2017 driven by a year of record energy volumes. And our Brent oil complex recorded its 21st year of volume as commercial customers increasingly rely on our platform to help meet their global hedging needs. As you can see, 2018 is off to a strong start building on our track record of growth upon growth. Open interest in our oil markets is up 9% year-over-year, with Brent futures hitting a new record in late January as investment in North Sea oilfields continues.","Similarly, in our Gasoil capital markets, average volumes are up 19% year-over-year as demand for diesel fuel rises on the back of an improving European and Asian economy. And given the Gasoil is a byproduct of a barrel of Brent crude oil, growth in our Gasoil business is generally a positive leading indicator for our Brent franchise. Notably, the extreme U.S. winter weather to start the year and the transitory market reports such as the surprise WTI inventory draw reported in January provided more speculative trading opportunities in the benchmark energy contracts of WTI and Henry Hub. While we benefited from the moves in these products, these types of trends tend to be transient in nature and not structural. Because we cater to a largely commercial customer base by offering a complete range of global energy contracts, our energy markets tend to be less cyclical in nature with an upward growth biased over the long-term.","Also in January, Europe implemented MiFID II\u2019s position limit and reporting regimes. While these created short-term challenges for many of our commodity customers, particularly in the month of December and through the first few weeks of January, these market concerns have now quieted as we found regulators to be receptive to our customers\u2019 concerns. In fact, the UK\u2019s FCA has processed over 1,000 hedge exemption applications, many of which were filed at the last minute to bring clarity to our customers. And as you can see, our crude oil market share has rebounded accordingly compared to the first few weeks of the year. Again, this was a transient versus structural moment.","Shifting to our longstanding global natural gas strategy, we continue to make progress on many fronts. In our North American markets, we operate the leading venue for natural gas basis trading, providing liquidity and hedging for over 100 gas delivery hubs. Given the structural changes in natural gas exploration in North America, we see signs that some of the large commercial customers are shifting away from hedging with the benchmark Henry Hub contract and are moving business into these regional basis markets. And this was demonstrated by record volume and open interest in our natural gas basis markets in January. The newest addition to our strategic natural gas efforts is our acquisition of NGX in December. It brings us additional trading, clearing and physical settlement solutions, enhancing our leading North American position. And when coupled with our European and UK natural gas contracts, we now offer a full range of trading and hedging tools across international markets, a service that our commercial customers view as increasingly important as this asset class continues to globalize.","Turning now to Slide 14, as we move into 2018 and look for ways to leverage our multi-asset class platform, there are many secular trends upon which we continue to capitalize. In the fixed income markets, we are creating an expanded platform that\u2019s designed to facilitate the efficiency and information increasingly sought by market participants. The fixed income market is one of the largest investable asset classes in the world with a market structure that is early in its transition from analog to digital workflow. We have assembled a unique suite of assets to help facilitate this evolution, while addressing specific customer needs along the way. We are a leading provider of independent fixed income pricing. We have a global reference data business that spans 11 million instruments across 145 countries. We have widely used fixed income analytics critical to our customers risk and inventory management work flows. We are now the second largest fixed income index provider following our fourth quarter acquisition of the Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch index suite, offering over 5,000 unique indices. And at the start of 2018 we closed on our acquisition of BondPoint, broadening our fixed income execution offering in the dealer to client segment. While we are still in the early days it\u2019s worth noting that BondPoint is off to a strong start in January registering the best volume month in its history, up 40% year-over-year. Customers are respectively engaging with the platform now that it\u2019s a part of the ICE fixed income ecosystem, demonstrating the complementary nature of our solutions. This suite of products and execution services are delivered over our purpose built secure connectivity safety platform that links the markets information and innovation essential to improving customer workflows. And so we positioned ourselves similar to how we have in times past to help evolve markets at inflection points, to bring efficiencies and to ingrain our services by the virtue of their capabilities into the daily workflows of our customers.","Shifting to our role as the leading venue in the world for capital raising, 2017 marked the seventh consecutive year that the New York Stock Exchange led in initial public offerings, raising over $31 billion. This is almost twice the amount raised by any other exchange globally. As the world\u2019s premier listing venue we have attracted 38 of the last 38 large IPOs defined as raising $700 million or more. And in 2017 we raised 89% of the technology sector proceeds in the United States. 2018 is off to an exceptional start with over $8 billion raised through initial public offerings, which is the best January in the NYSE\u2019s 225 year history.","I will conclude my remarks on Slide 15. 2017 was another record year. We grew revenues, margins, earnings and capital returns to new levels. We expanded our ability to provide unique mission critical content to drive markets. We enhanced our distribution by bringing markets, information and participants together and we continue to broaden the addressable market for our future strategic growth. So as we look to 2018 and beyond the foundation that we have created for sustainable organic growth has never been stronger nor has our opportunity set then is broad. Just a few weeks into the year we can already report on this strong foundation. In our derivatives business interest rate futures volumes rose 28% in January. Our North American natural gas volumes grew 16%. Our Gasoil volume rose 19%. In our data business global signings were up 12%, while ASV enters the New Year up 6%. And in our newly expanded fixed income business we benefited from BondPoint\u2019s 30% volume growth. And this growth is all off a base record year for us in 2017. As a leading provider of vital infrastructure and information the financial and commodity markets we continue to look for ways to efficiently connect the market participants with the risk management solutions that they need. It\u2019s a virtuous cycle, one fueled by a pursuit of efficiency and productivity. This is the platform that we positioned to generate sustainable long-term growth with benefits accruing to all stakeholders.","So I would like to thank our customers for their business in 2017. And I want to thank my colleagues for their hard work and contributions to another record year, a year in which we became the first exchange operator to join the Fortune 500 and were named as one of Fortune magazine\u2019s Future 50 companies. These credits are something that we do not seek out, but I hope that our team takes great pride in being recognized. I will now turn our call back to our moderator Kate and we will conduct the question-and-answer session until 9.30 AM Eastern Time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Rich Repetto of Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.","Rich Repetto","Good morning Jeff, good morning Scott and I guess I will start broad Jeff, you had a significant win with \u2013 in MiFID II in the open access mandate being delayed. So, I am just trying to get like how important that was to you? And then related to that, when you look at MiFID II, I know you talked about the impact in energy, but MiFID II and Brexit, you have had more time to look at Brexit as well. What\u2019s your view on it now both from a fundamental and M&A standpoint from those two items?","Jeff Sprecher","Sure. Well, I think as you know we have spent a tremendous amount of time in Europe with the most senior people in governments all over Europe discussing the pluses and minuses of the open access provision, the way it was drafted and designed in MiFID II. And there is a concern across Europe whether or not the way that that particular provision operates makes sense in the future without the UK as a part of the EU and whether it makes sense to help drive the economy together and finance the real economy without overly fragmenting markets and creating a lot of inefficiencies. So, we saw governments all across Europe coordinate a move to delay that and what you could see now and it gets reported on from time-to-time is a conversation that\u2019s going on across the EU over whether or not that provision fits with their future and whether or not there should be some modification or reworking of broadly of MiFID, but specifically of that provision. So, we are very engaged in that conversation. We had a lot to do with the delay and we appreciate that the governments did delay and that they did engage with us and that they have taken a step back. More broadly, MiFID as I said in my prepared remarks, it was \u2013 it\u2019s just the way markets work, but a lot of people were unprepared and notwithstanding that we all have been talking about MiFID for years now on these calls, but a lot of customers waited till the last minute. There are some very specific reporting requirements. There are some very specific position limits, accountability type requirements.","And so I mentioned that the FCA in particular processed over thousand applications. You did see at the end of December and into January a lot of people just stepped out of the market trying to figure out how this would work fortunately its much calmer. The FCA at our request has held a number of meetings and calls, broad calls with the market is going to continue to do more on how MiFID gets implemented across particularly our UK exchange and we really appreciate that they have engaged on that. I have had a lot of Brexit conversations with senior people over this period in addition to talking about MiFID. I think there is a lot of positive work going on underneath the headlines of Brexit, but there still has to be a deal agreed and how that\u2019s going to work and how that\u2019s going to shape out, it\u2019s very hard to know and there is certainly a possibility that things could go pear-shaped in the process. So, we have a cautious view towards Europe right now. That being said, we made an investment in Europe clear, which is a custody custodian \u2013 a custody solution for Europe. It\u2019s one that we use. It\u2019s one that we will continue to use and it\u2019s one that we want to help, grow and expand. So, while we have some broad concerns about how Europe unfolds where we have seen strategic ability to pinpoint opportunity we certainly will do it.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Ken Worthington","Hi, good morning. I want to talk about the BAML Index business, so you are providing reference data now for BAML, you have got pricing now for BAML I guess maybe you had it before is how do you see? There is analytics for BAML. What kind of cross-selling did you guys pursue in the quarter for these ancillary services? And I know it feels very early, but was there any positive impact from the ancillary services this quarter and if so or even if not maybe what is the outlook against the ancillary services provided to BAML as we look out say like a year or so? Thanks.","Jeff Sprecher","Sure. Well, first of all, it\u2019s been great. I mean in a word it\u2019s been incredibly well received. And I have mentioned this before Ken and I think also in response to some of your questions on earlier calls that it gets harder and harder in financial services to provide content to major firms, because of the connectivity and cyber security issues. And because there is so much pressure on firms today from a regulatory standpoint they need really good clean data and information distributed across organizations in a way that is easily consumed. So by having a broader package of things that we can deliver people that didn\u2019t pay attention to these offerings when they weren\u2019t a part of the ICE ecosystem are suddenly paying attention to them and so that is essentially a cross-sell. And because so many people now are hooked to our safety network and increasingly hooking to our safety network in fact is one of fastest growing parts of our company. They have a pipe already that is secure that has the cyber security promenades over it that allows us to pretty easily get behind firewalls and deliver new products and services. So it\u2019s going well. The other \u2013 the interesting thing about this market as we have talked about before on both on this call and you and I privately is that there is kind of rapid demand for clean information and so it is not a case where a customer will buy information from one provider and not buy from a second provider. If people are taking the data and information and indices from multiple providers and some as a backup if you will for their own BCP planning and some just because there is a thirst for the best information that people can find, because of the increased use of quantitative analysis in investing. So longwinded way of saying the thesis that we had is working and Lynn Martin who is running that business is excited frankly about the responses that her team is getting particularly in that area of indices and valuation.","Operator","The next question is from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Dan Fannon","Thanks. Good morning, Scott you mentioned your capital priorities are returning 100% of the free cash flow net of M&A, so I guess can you update us your thoughts on M&A after pretty active year of divestitures and small deals in 2017?","Scott Hill","Yes. I think we are looking at the world the same way, we have said it a while ago that our focus would be on incremental both on deals and that\u2019s absolutely what we have executed on. I think the good news embedded in all of it is we were very active last year and are still sitting right in our leverage range with good on the balance sheet with as I mentioned earlier 20% increase in the dividend and a 20% increase of the share buyback authorization of which we already spent in one-twelfth of the year. So I think as we look out, we are continue to focus on strategic M&A that will enhance businesses that we already have, our strategies that we are pursuing, but the key as is always for us is can we find those deals at the right price that generate the right levels of return for investors.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Carrier of Bank of America. Pleased go ahead.","Sameer Murukutla","Hi, good morning, guys. This is a Sameer Murukutla on for Michael Carrier. Thanks for taking question. Just a quick one just related to the data services revenue again, I guess one is the 6% to 7% growth including any FX benefits and I guess given the divestitures and the wind down of those businesses and I guess that they are really strong ASVs and signings, I guess why isn\u2019t this growth in \u201818 even higher than the 6% to 7%?","Jeff Sprecher","Yes. So first of all, the 6% to 7% as reported or at constant currency in each I expect will be in that range. Obviously, FX right now is a little bit of a help, but I think we will grow between 6% and 7% as reported and at constant currency on an organic basis. And compared to last year that\u2019s coming off 5 and so when you are asking why is not growing faster, it\u2019s growing significantly faster than it did in \u201817. And then I will note a couple of points that \u2013 I will repeat a couple of points that I said in my prepared remarks that includes our pricing analytics business that\u2019s going to grow faster than 7% versus 5% last year and 3.5% in \u201816 and 2% when it was owned by IDC. That includes our connectivity and feeds business that\u2019s going to grow faster than 7% again in 2018. And it\u2019s mitigated a little bit by exchange data where it will grow, but it\u2019s going to grow in kind of the low single-digits. So we are really happy, not only with the overall growth of that business, but the mix of revenues. And then the other thing not to lose sight of is we are growing revenues with a starting margin of 51%, which is significantly above anybody else in our space. So we are happy with the growth, we like the margin profile, the incremental margins will be the better. And again we feel good about the strength of data business across the board.","Ben Jackson","And one other point that gets to some of the core of what we do is we have been trying to be more open and transparent about the data that comes out of the cash equities market, the New York Stock Exchange in the cash equities market. We participate in the SIP which is the industry revenue generator. Behind the scenes, we have been pushing the SEP to be more transparent. We have a proposal that\u2019s down the table for quite a while that the SIP committee is looking at and it\u2019s going to take up shortly to become more transparent. We on our last call for the first time started to put more color around that particular business. But long story short, there is really not a lot of growth in the earnings from U.S. cash equities markets. And I think that\u2019s maybe surprised people and is partly why we want there to be more transparency around the SIP. And that\u2019s a part of \u2013 for reporting purposes that\u2019s all embedded in that data business as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alex Blostein","Hi guys, good morning. I want to go back to data again for a second, I am looking at Slide 7, so Scott you guys continued to kind of give us a little bit more color on the drivers in this business which is definitely appreciated, I want to hit on the capacity growth number that you highlighted it\u2019s plus 20% year-over-year on safety network, I guess A, how should we think about this is kind of the leading indicator for data connectivity, any sort of revenue base you can kind of circle around to think about okay this is really the base that is growing and is indicative of this 22% growth or should we think of that more of a pay customers are using more capacity and we will be buying more of our data, so that\u2019s actually a leading indicator for the other stuff?","Scott Hill","Yes. That\u2019s a great question. And look we are a couple of years into the business. My sense is that the connectivity capacity growth is very similar to open interest. If it\u2019s trending up \u2013 that if open interest is trending up that\u2019s a good thing about the future prospects of our trading business. As the capacity grows that\u2019s a good thing about our data business. And as we dig deeper into that understanding that business, one of the reasons I have that confidence is connectivity and the feeds businesses growth, so more people are taking more of their data from us. A lot of it\u2019s our proprietary data, but it\u2019s also feeds from other places as we become the single source, they need greater capacity in order to consume the data from us. And including those feeds, we are seeing customers sign up, historically it was more people connecting to the NYSE, now we are seeing more people connect up through safety, which again will help drive more trading, will help drive more data on our \u2013 on the commodities side of our business. So as I look at the capacity growing 20% last year it will grow double digits again in this year, people are moving up smaller ports to larger ports, for me it\u2019s definitely a leading indicator. And one of the reasons why Jeff talked about the additional transparency with regards to exchange data. But one of the reasons why we are giving so much additional transparency on data revenue growth is because we have metrics like this capacity, that give us confidence that the growth we are seeing is sustainable.","Operator","The next question is from Ben Herbert of Citi. Please go ahead.","Ben Herbert","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just another question around data and just the pricing in analytics, the 40% of signs from your growth [ph] products and then do you think back to your June Investor Day and that mix of data, revenue drivers, I know that\u2019s more of a long-term guide, but if we think of it this year just with newer products how that mix shift, that 20% that was guided back in June that might be a bigger share in \u201818 or maybe even into \u201819 just on some of your newer product developments? Thank you.","Jeff Sprecher","Yes, great. So, thanks for the question. So, if you look at our revenue guidance in 2018 what we expect to get from new products is very much in line with what we showed you in June. And so the contribution we expected to be strong, it is strong. In addition to that, some of these new products are also driving another part of that pie we showed you that was meaningful with new customers. And so particularly in Europe, customers who have new demands put on them from MiFID, we are seeing consume those products. And so there is a little bit of a lead over between what\u2019s the new product and what\u2019s the new customer, but each are contributing to the overall growth. And when I talk about the 40% coming from those products, you will understand that some of those are new liquidity indicators. As an example, our BestEx product as an example that continue as evaluative prices has been around for a while, so that\u2019s not really a new product as much as it is for a platform to develop future new products. So overall, the contribution that we showed you in June if you look at it in terms of pricing new products, new customers, high retentions, we have around 95% retention in our pricing analytics business again last year. All of those things are contributing in a very good balance by the way in growth in \u201817 and also again in the growth in \u201818.","Operator","The next question is from Alex Kramm of UBS. Please go ahead.","Alex Kramm","Hey, good morning. I want to stay on the data side and it\u2019s probably an extension of some of the last few questions, but maybe you can be a little bit more specific around MiFID II and what you are seeing there? I guess, because you are obviously showing the upside in signings in Europe, so maybe you can give a little bit more detail of what exactly you have been seeing, but then more importantly how far along do you think the customer base is when it comes to the data side meaning like do you think throughout 2018 there is still a very big addressable market of people that still need to get ready, you still need to get BestEx products from you. And I guess around the confidence level just for more sales there? Then maybe just real quick on the flipside as well, I mean, budgets are still coming down because of MiFID II. So, I am just wondering if you are actually seeing people also struggling with budgets even canceling some of the things that are not as must have? Thank you.","Jeff Sprecher","Yes. So, that\u2019s a great question, Alex and I will tell you I am very bullish on what we are seeing in EMEA related to MiFID II. And I think that \u2013 what I think Lynn Martin and I as we talk about it Tim Noble, who runs sales, they are very excited, but we are early days. There are some companies that have begun to prepare and have begun to understand what MiFID II\u2019s implications are, but its early days. And so as I look at 29% growth in signings in EMEA in terms of pricing and analytics as I look at ASV for pricing and analytics, which is above the 6% ASV on average, there is no question in my mind that MiFID II in particular and we noted on Slide 7 things like BestEx and CEP and liquidity indicators, all of those products are still really in demand in terms of Europe. And I will tell you that some of that confidence in that answer is reflected in the fact that our pricing and analytics signings in January were 40% higher. And so we have seen it and I don\u2019t have the geographic breakdown yet, but my guess is when we split it out, Europe is going to be a big driver of that growth just as it was for the year on Slide 7. The other thing that\u2019s really encouraging is though we have designed these products, the BestEx, the liquidity indicators to meet specific requirements of MiFID II customers in the U.S. and Asia are starting to see the efficacy of using those products as well. And so I am encouraged that those products will continue to be in demand in Europe, but also we will start to contribute more and more to the growth we are seeing in the U.S. and also in Asia. And so it\u2019s a great example where our product innovation to meet a given need with the sales team that\u2019s focused, which ours is, it offers a great opportunity to start to sell those products and their bill for purpose used to the other customers in different geographies and different industries and so excited about Europe, I believe were early days in direct response to your question, but also excited about the prospects for some of those products outside of Europe.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Brian Bedell","Hi, good morning. Thanks, folks. Maybe just switching gears a little bit to the fixed income strategy, maybe question for both Scott and Jeff on this. Maybe Scott, if you could give us a little bit of a refresh of the revenue contribution from BondPoint parsing that out from NGX, the last data we had is a little old and given the increase in volumes in BondPoint coming into January, I just want to get a better sense of the revenue trajectory in the fixed income trading platform overall? And then maybe just more strategically Jeff, on as you think about that marrying with the BAML indices if you can talk about your view of how that platform will progress during this year?","Scott Hill","Yes. So I will start and no, we haven\u2019t disclosed specifically the revenues associated with the bond business. As Jeff alluded to, we had a record month in BondPoint in January over 30% growth in terms of volumes. The way I would characterize it is it\u2019s a relatively small part of our revenue today, but a very big growth opportunity as we move forward.","Jeff Sprecher","Yes. And what we have put together is an interesting collection of assets that is all available essentially on that safety network and the way we are thinking about it is that if an existing customer in one of those businesses want to just continue as they have in the past, that\u2019s fine, but what we really are trying to do is go to that customer and say, we have a whole suite of services around fixed income and since we have a purchasing relationship on a connectivity relationship with you, why don\u2019t you think about these other opportunities and we have put those together through our sales efforts in a package if you will. And we also have the benefit of the fact that NYSE Arca is the leading listings platform for ET apps and we have a very close working relationship with the ETF providers and are also following this trend of ETF growth in the fixed income space. It\u2019s a very convenient way for people to own fixed income instruments and is one of the fastest growing parts of that space. So, we \u2013 there are lot of services that\u2019s around NYSE that we can also provide for people that are launching and marketing those kinds of products. So, it\u2019s been a great reception so far with the various bits and bobs that we have put together. And honestly, I think it\u2019s even surprised us that a lot of major companies that didn\u2019t pay attention to certain pieces that we have now that they are under the ICE name and on our connectivity platform, these customers are very engaged with us in a way that bodes well for our future.","Ben Jackson","And I will just give you one quick data point in this period, we gave you a chart last quarter that said if you look at BondPoint in Jackson, Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch indices does it add about $93 million of revenue and I will tell you that split roughly half between NGX and the other half with BondPoint and Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. So, that will give you an idea of the base from which we believe we will grow.","Operator","The next question is from Chris Allen of Rosenblatt. Please go ahead.","Chris Allen","Good morning, guys. I am getting this question a lot from clients. So, I was just wondering if you guys could clarify the market data guide what\u2019s the impact from the acquisitions in 2018, it looks about $20 million. Is that based on kind of the 2017 run-rate and does that bake in any incremental growth opportunities for those that set of businesses you acquired?","Scott Hill","So, I am going to answer your question and if my answer indicates I didn\u2019t understand, then I ask it again, but our 6% to 7% growth in the data business is an organic number. And so it doesn\u2019t benefit from nor does it detracted from in terms of acquisitions. So again going back to the models we showed you in June that model showed you that typically we will have around 10% plus or minus contribution from acquisitions, but in the 6% to 7% guide, that\u2019s organic \u2013 again organic as reported organic constant currency it doesn\u2019t matter we are going to grow 6% to 7% overall. And if you are looking for kind of the net impact of the acquisitions on data revenues, we gave you that on the last quarter that\u2019s $18 million, but again organic 6% to 7%, no benefit from acquisitions, no work from divestitures, it\u2019s 6% to 7% real growth that we are driving through all the reasons we have talked about on the call.","Operator","The next question is from Vincent Hung of Autonomous. Please go ahead.","Vincent Hung","Hey. I know you talked about a bit on last quarter\u2019s call and touch upon it today, but now having had a bit of time to look around your cliff and maybe a quarter or so, I will be interested to get your thoughts on that asset in terms of like the structural opportunities or you think you could do for them specifically and then ultimately whether you would be interested in control?","Jeff Sprecher","Well, first of all, we think it\u2019s an interesting asset and it\u2019s one that we are a customer of and we use and so it\u2019s important to us. And so we had a \u2013 have had a long pre-existing relationship. But we like the management very much there we like the Chairman. And we really feel like that we can do things with it together with that company to both help us and the ICE shareholders and help Euroclear. It\u2019s similar to all that we had when we invested in Cetip in Brazil, which allowed us to launch a number of new initiatives in Brazil that on the back of that in partnership with Cetip and even though we have now sold out Cetip as it merged into BM&F. We still have those initiatives operating in Brazil and they are still very important to us. So we see that same template if you will with Euroclear. I think that we will know more. We have been invited to join the Board and Hester Serafini, who runs our U.S. clearing operations \u2013 commodity clearing operations is going to join that Board. And so we will have more insight, at least she will have more insight into how we can contribute at the governance level. But long story short I think it\u2019s a very good company and I think we have good relationships that will allow us to find opportunities together.","Operator","The next question is from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Chris Harris","Hi guys, you are going to be moving some of your energy contracts to the U.S. I believe later this month, so just wondering can you guys can talk a little bit about that action whether that might create any complexity to your customers and could we see you guys do more there?","Jeff Sprecher","Sure, let me ask Ben Jackson who is here for the first time to take that one.","Ben Jackson","Thanks Chris. I am going to speak to all of you for the first time in this forum. So it\u2019s easy for people and we got a lot of questions around this when we move to looking at and thinking of this particular fallout from MiFID. And the reality is that this move is primarily about responding to our customers, their trade, our North American energy complex. These customers are primarily based in North America, they wanted our North American products to be based in North America. As Jeff mentioned in his comments our North American energy complex is doing well. When we looked at our portfolio of North American products, some of which were executed in the U.S. maybe our gas power complex in the U.S. and others in Europe with our natural gas liquids and North American oil complex and then you add on top of it the strategic acquisition of NGX. We have even more products in North America. So we collaborate with customers and determined that bringing this complex together in North America was the right way to service their needs. We have always \u2013 it\u2019s important now that we have always had a strategy of having multiple venues around the world to be able to have a diversified portfolio and easy way for our customers that access our various products around the world.","Operator","The next question is from Kyle Voigt of KBW. Please go ahead.","Kyle Voigt","Hi, I am just going to try one more on Euroclear, maybe one for Scott, I am just wondering if the opportunity came up we are becoming a majority owner in asset that needs a banking license to give you any pause and I believe Euroclear also has a very high credit rating, I think AA for competitive reasons, certain constraints that contain your leverage in credit ratings of the majority owned? And then lastly, maybe you could just give us an update on dividends you expect to receive from Euroclear in 2018 in the other income line? Thank you.","Scott Hill","Sure. In the 10 years, I have been here we have never been settled in the M&A. And so the concept of creed to control and all that is \u2013 that\u2019s I guess on further talk, but I think Jeff, it was very eloquently described exactly what our intent here. And I think he is right it\u2019s completely analogous to fatigue. We think the management team now does a good job. We think the Chairman is managing the governance structure in a good way. We know a lot of the customers. We are one of the customers. So this is about aligning our interest interest to try and go after interesting strategic opportunities together, that\u2019s what this is about. And so I have looked at whether I want a banking license or not, we had one of those with ICE Trust. It was a little bit painful, but we managed through it. But again, we are not looking at those considerations, because that\u2019s not what this investment is. This investment is aligning our strategic interest for somebody to whom we are a big customer right now and what we believe can be a good partner and help develop additional custodial and collateral management capabilities that will benefit both of our customer sets.","To your specific question, as was reported a week or so ago and as we disclosed further in our 10-K today, we have reached agreement to acquire an additional stake that would bring us to around 9.8% in total. That portion has not yet closed. And so it\u2019s difficult for me to tell you the size of the dividend, it could be 4 to 5. If the dividend is paid before this next set close, it could be 9 to 10, if the next round we get the regulatory approvals we need in time. And then in terms of timing, my expectation would be it would hit in first or second quarter, but we will give you more guidance as we know more on that. Again, the dividend is the nice return that we get over the short-term, but we are in this for the strategic partnership not the dividend.","Operator","The next question is a follow-up from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Brian Bedell","Great. Thanks so much. I just wanted to follow-up on your comments on the market on close offering from BAPS, your view whether that\u2019s going to end up going through despite the protest we got in NASDAQ and maybe just sort of the portion of trading on revenue that happens at the close of the NYSE?","Jeff Sprecher","Sure. So, in terms of where that is, it\u2019s been asked for the commission, the full commission to vote on whether or not that market structure should go forward. It\u2019s been approved by the staff and now it will go in front of the full commission. There is no timing on that. It\u2019s not been scheduled. So, it\u2019s hard to know when or if that \u2013 how that will be heard, but we are opposed to the proposal, because the market what we think will happen if that goes ahead is not one competitor challenging the liquidity at the close of the listing exchanges, we think all competitors will challenge all listings and what you will see is a massive fragmentation of the close and on days like Monday, where ETFs and stocks are highly volatile having a difficult time settling to have fragmented that a central moment for benefit that really hasn\u2019t been accounted. I mean, it\u2019s hard to know what the cost benefit of a highly fragmented market will be to save a few pennies and essentially in a market structure. Why one would do that? So, we have asked for the full commission to think about those issues and for the industry to really discuss those issues. Listed companies when they decide where to list their shares have multiple opportunities now to there are 3 about to be 4 exchanges that will handle a listing. And part of the listing process is a discussion about the various auctions and settlement mechanisms that each exchange uses and listed companies are coming out opposed to being forced to have their closing moved to another exchange after they have made a decision and are worried about this fragmentation. So we will see where it goes. I am a bit surprised that this is even being promulgated honestly that the highest priced closing, the person that charges is the most at the closing is the one that\u2019s actually trying to promote this idea. In my mind, I don\u2019t know why they wanted to put that offering that they have at risk, but nonetheless the proposals out there and I think the industry will have a pretty vigorous debate and we will see where this lands, but it won\u2019t be without a lot of negative input from market participants who as they think through the repercussions of the idea.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Sprecher for closing remarks.","Jeff Sprecher","Thank you, Kate and we appreciate your time today. Thanks for joining us and we will continue to update you through the quarter and through the year as we build out on the strategy that we discussed. Thank you everybody.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect."],"11970":["IntercontinentalExchange Group (NYSE:ICE) Q2 2014 Earnings Call August  7, 2014  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Kelly L.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kelly Loeffler, Senior Vice President. Please go ahead.","Kelly L. Loeffler","Good morning. ICE's second quarter 2014 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of our website at theice.com. These items will be archived, and our call will be available for replay.","Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2013 Form 10-K. In addition to GAAP results, we've also referred to certain non-GAAP measures, including adjusted operating results from continuing operations, adjusted net income and EPS from continuing operations. These measures adjust GAAP results for certain extraordinary items, including the NYSE acquisition and discontinued operations, and, we believe, are more reflective of the core business performance than GAAP results. You'll find the non-GAAP reconciliation in the earnings release and presentation, an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful and how management uses these measures. Net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses.","With us on the call are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Chuck Vice, President and Chief Operating Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Scott.","Scott A. Hill","Thank you, Kelly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4, where I'll provide a summary of our first half performance.","Despite the continued headwinds of low volatility, which resulted in futures volumes declining 19% in the first half, ICE's consolidated net revenues of $1.5 billion were basically flat year-on-year on a pro forma basis. We expanded adjusted operating margins to 50%, and we grew adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations 2% to $4.38 per share.","In addition, during June, we completed the IPO of Euronext and used those proceeds to effectively reduce our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA leverage to our target of 1.5x. We also reached agreements to sell the nonstrategic NYSE Technologies businesses. Then, moving into July, we repurchased 1.8 million shares of our stock for $350 million. And finally, we continue to make good progress on our integration plan, including the successful transition of the Liffe US contracts onto our ICE Futures exchanges. Our improved full year guidance now reflects the achievement of nearly half of our original $500 million synergy target, and we have increased that target to $550 million to reflect additional synergies related to our cash equity and equity options businesses.","Our ability to grow earnings in the first half against the backdrop of declining volume is driven by many factors, including a favorable mix of products, diversification across our global markets, continuous product development and our disciplined focus on expense management. Importantly, there remain numerous metrics, from rising open interest levels to customer log-ins, that indicate volume declines are cyclical rather than structural. Open interest across our asset classes grew 5% from the end of 2013, and we established several volume records despite the overall low volatility environment.","Please turn to Slide 5, where I will briefly discuss our second quarter results. Consolidated net revenues were $750 million. Adjusted operating expenses were $387 million, and our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 48%. We also received $15 million in dividends from Cetip in the second quarter, which are reflected in other income. This includes an $11 million annual dividend and $4 million in quarterly interest and dividend payments, reflecting an increased payout ratio and a shift to quarterly versus annual dividend payments in 2014. This quarterly income is an important and recurring return on our investment and our partnership with Cetip.","Our tax rate came in towards the higher end of our range at 29% as our business mix this year has shifted more towards the U.S. given the softer volumes in Europe.","Adjusted net income attributable to ICE from continuing operations was $243 million, and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.10.","For the first half of 2014, operating cash flow was $836 million, an increase of 1% versus the pro forma operating cash flows of the 2 companies in the prior 6 months, excluding discontinued operations. During the same period, investments in operational capital expenditures and capitalized software were $87 million.","Now let's move to Slide 6, where we detail revenues and expenses for the second quarter. On the left side of the chart, you can see that over 60% of our $750 million in net revenue is made up of transaction and clearing net revenue, which totaled $460 million. Market data revenues were $96 million. This includes Liffe market data revenues, which declined about $6 million from the first quarter as we transitioned to separate data packages for Liffe and Euronext. We expect to recover at least half of that decline in the third quarter. Market data revenues for legacy ICE increased modestly, indicating continued strong interest in these markets. We also generated $83 million in revenue from listings. Excluding the purchase accounting adjustment, listings revenue would have been up 5% year-to-year. Other revenue contributed $111 million in the second quarter.","The right side of Slide 6 shows our expense detail. Second quarter adjusted expenses were $387 million and came in below our guidance primarily due to a $6 million R&D state tax credit reflected in compensation expense, which relates to 2012 and '13. While future credits and the timing of such credits depend on the continuing extension of federal R&D tax credits, we expect to receive a recurring benefit for the current and future years. Adjusting for this benefit in the quarter, we would have come in at the low end of the range of our expense guidance. And importantly, adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 48%, reflecting the benefit of the more than $200 million in synergies we've already realized.","Moving now to Slide 7. I'll discuss our derivatives revenue and volumes in greater detail. Total futures and options revenue was $329 million on volume that declined 20% year-to-year, reflecting low volatility across most asset classes. This includes European interest rates that declined significantly compared to 2013 volumes, which grew 25%, and against the backdrop of recent ECB rate cuts that have kept short-term interest rates near 0 in the EU.","Despite the decline in volumes, open interest trends are encouraging. Open interest was 79 million contracts at the end of the second quarter, a 5% increase from the end of 2013. Excluding natural gas, open interest was 58 million contracts at the end of the second quarter, up 17% from year end. Brent and other oil open interest are at record levels, up 25% and 17%, respectively, at the end of June compared to year end. And interest rates open interest is up 17% year-to-date. And as we've seen before, once volatility and seasonal activity returns, these types of healthy open interest levels generally translate into volume growth.","We announced July volumes on Tuesday, and despite declining volumes in energy, our July energy revenues were up versus the prior year and up significantly from the second quarter of this year. This is a tangible example of the growth in Brent OI turning into a meaningful revenue contribution as volatility returns. And the slight RPC decline was due to the typical declines we see related to customer mix during volatile periods and remind us that it's revenue, not RPC, that generates profit.","Continuing with our derivatives markets on Slide 8, I'll update you on our CDS business. CDS revenues were $41 million in the second quarter, up 3% year-to-year. This was driven by a 6% increase in clearing revenues to $24 million. In the first half of 2014, we continued to enhance our product set, including clearing for the market iTraxx Senior Financial CDS Index and sovereign CDS instruments on Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ireland. In the course of just a few months, we've cleared $537 billion in gross notional value in these new contracts.","Turning next to Slide 9. You will see a summary of the second quarter performance of our U.S. cash equities and U.S. options exchanges. While second quarter volumes in cash equities were down 12% year-to-year, we achieved market share gains both year-on-year and sequentially. And as you will hear from Jeff, we continue to focus on a constructive dialogue with our industry and regulators to reduce market complexity.","In our U.S. options business, we also saw muted volumes, resulting in average daily volume declining 21%. Though market share was down year-over-year, market share and RPC were steady sequentially.","And as reported on Tuesday, our July volumes were mixed, with U.S. cash equities average daily volume of 1.3 billion down 4% year-over-year but with U.S. equity options average daily volume of 3.6 million rising by 1% year-over-year.","Next, on Slide 10, we provide an overview of our cash generation and debt profile. Operating cash flows grew to $836 million during the first half. At June 30, we had $2.1 billion in unrestricted cash. On a trailing 12-month basis, our cash earnings per share were $9.64, which is a 6% increase in cash earnings over the same period in 2013. We calculate cash EPS using operating cash flow less capital expenditures, divided by the weighted average shares outstanding. We believe this is an important metric for investors to consider as it reflects the cash-generative capability of our business.","We completed the IPO of Euronext in June and received total net proceeds of $1.9 billion. Following the receipt of the proceeds, we set aside $1.3 billion to repay the June 2015 euro notes when they mature. In addition, the proceeds were also used to reduce our outstanding commercial paper by $563 million during the quarter. As a result, adjusted gross debt-to-EBITDA is 1.5x.","Our target debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of 1.5x will remain an important focus. However, you'll see us moving around that target from time to time based on the cash flow of the business, the timing of strategic investment opportunities and our capital return program.","Please now move to Slide 11, where I'll provide an update on our capital allocation. We remain focused on driving both earnings growth and delivering strong returns by investing in our business while also providing a prudent level of capital return to shareholders, both through dividends and share buybacks.","As you can see on Slide 11, capital returns were modest in 2012 and 2013 as we prepared to close the NYX transaction. However, prior to that, from 2008 to 2011, we repurchased nearly $600 million of our common stock. And in July, after using Euronext proceeds to achieve our leverage target, we spent $350 million to repurchase 1.8 million shares of our common stock under our existing $450 million share repurchase plan. And our Board of Directors recently expanded our share repurchase authorization by an additional $600 million. As the chart indicates, based upon our current dividend level and assuming we utilize the remaining $700 million for future share repurchases by the end of 2015, we may return as much as $1.7 billion to shareholders during 2014 and '15 combined, including over $1.1 billion in the next 17 months. Importantly, we believe we can do this while continuing to invest in our existing business and while participating in strategic M&A to drive long-term growth.","I'll wrap up on Slides 12 and 13. Slide 12 shows the evolution of our expense base and synergy achievement. The chart begins with the data we provided when we announced the NYSE acquisition in December 2012 and includes adjustments to remove Euronext and NYSE Technologies from the expense base. Importantly, as noted on the first bullet of this slide, after a comprehensive review of the NYSE operations, we have identified an additional $50 million of expense synergies. This includes the technology platform rationalization we discussed last quarter, as well as efficiency gains across other areas of the business. The increased total of $550 million in expense synergies exiting 2016 means we will have reduced the combined company's total expense base by roughly 30% and the NYSE Liffe expense base by well over 40%.","Moving to the graph, you will recall that in our November strategic and financial update, we noted $95 million in expense synergies had already been achieved. We subsequently noted that we would achieve between $35 million and $40 million of synergies from the discontinued NYSE Technologies businesses. Adding those 2 together, you get $132 million of synergies achieved and a continuing ops expense base of just over $1.6 billion.","Our current full year expense guidance reflects an additional $108 million in synergies versus that new base, bringing the total to $240 million in 2014. And as we exit this year, our first quarter 2015 expenses should reflect a run rate to achieve 70% or $350 million of our original synergies, excluding any additional investments we may make during 2015. You can see that as the synergies increase and as we divest nonstrategic businesses, our total expense base comes down significantly. You can also see this progress in our operating margin, which, as noted previously, was 50% for the first half of 2014.","Turning quickly to Slide 13. I'll point out our updated guidance for the third quarter and full year. All guidance completely excludes Euronext and the to-be-sold NYSE Technology businesses. You'll note improvement in virtually every element of our expense guidance. Importantly, you'll also note that D&A is 2x larger than operational CapEx, which is another important factor when considering the cash generation of our business.","I'll be happy to answer any questions about our guidance or any other topics during Q&A. For now, though, I'll hand the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Thank you, Scott. Good morning to those on the call. Since completing our acquisition of NYSE, we've moved quickly to achieve the objectives we established when we announced our transaction. With many of the strategic changes implemented, we've provided guidance related to our business model post Euronext. We're working to innovate for our customers amid a time of tremendous change in the industry, and we continue to drive improvements in market structure in each of the asset classes we serve. Through new products and services being introduced, we're well positioned for the return to a more normalized volatility levels over time. Periods of change are when ICE excels, and throughout our history, we've developed risk management tools and infrastructure that reduces friction in markets and creates efficiencies. In short, we're focused on these objectives to grow and to lead. While specifics around regulation around the world may diverge, the common theme is that trading and risk management continue to move on exchange and into clearinghouses. Therefore, we're taking our cues from the opportunities that come from this trend rather than from the current period of low volatility.","As you can see on Slide 14, we have continuously evolved ICE to lead global financial markets into the future. With our humble beginnings as an OTC energy market, today we operate 11 exchanges, covering 9 asset classes, and have 5 clearinghouses. And we're preparing to expand with the relaunch of ICE Futures Singapore and ICE Clear Singapore in the coming months.","With our acquisition of NYSE and Liffe, our markets now include some of the largest markets for interest rates, cash equities, equity options and global commodities. And despite competitors with aggressive payment for order flow programs in our flagship products, our markets remain the venue of choice for risk management due to our breadth of products, liquidity, capital efficiency and our focus on designing our products around our customer requirements.","We've built infrastructure to extend deeper into risk management and workflow activities. We launched ICE Benchmark Administration, which now oversees both LIBOR and ISDAFIX to rebuild confidence in these vital benchmarks. And with the demand for automation, we developed the compliance and workflow tools such as ICE Trade Vault and ICE Link. So taken together, the value of integrated trading, clearing, data and post-trade services offers value beyond trade matching, which is why our adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations declined just 4% in the quarter amid double-digit volume declines.","I'll walk through some of our volume trends, which you can see starting on Slide 15. In addition to the secular trends that produced annual growth in ICE's Brent crude volume, recent geopolitical unrest has also driven volumes. In June, ICE Brent ADV increased 18% year-on-year, and open interest reached a record all-time high. As we reported this week, Brent volume in July grew 26% year-to-year to 827,000 contracts per day. So you can see we started the third quarter above our 2013 level of 700,000 contracts per day. Longer term, we believe the growth trend is solid due to our Brent Crude Oil benchmark's global relevance and the capital efficiencies across our oil complex of more than 400 related futures contracts.","Moving to Slide 16. You can see North American natural gas volumes remain depressed, but open interest remained significantly above precrisis levels. The North American natural gas market continues to transform as it adjusts to the new shale supply. The market is still working through how the additional supply will be stored, transported, exported and consumed. Such infrastructure takes time to come online, so this is a multiyear shift in reshaping the U.S. natural gas markets. This also means that natural gas markets will likely globalize as projects and regulation to manage LNG transportation and export come online in the next few years. In the meantime, low prices are driving increased consumption as energy producers increasingly switch from coal and propane to natural gas.","The right hand of the chart is our European natural gas futures volume, which is traded on ICE Endex and includes our U.K. and continental European natural gas hubs. Again, in the second quarter, volume more than doubled year-to-year and open interest continued to grow as customers seek efficiency and liquidity of exchange-traded markets. Historically, the European natural gas markets have been a bilateral over-the-counter market, but over time, this business has begun to migrate on exchange.","Now if you move to Slide 17, you can see a solid base of volume in our financial futures and options markets. Low interest rates across most of the Eurozone are impacting our euro-denominated Euribor futures volume, which is also up against tough comparisons due to strong rates activity in last year's second quarter. This is somewhat offset, however, by solid performance in our U.K. sterling futures and options contracts, where volume and open interest were up 27% and 67%, respectively, year-on-year in the second quarter due to the changing expectations for U.K. interest rates. Open interest across our European interest rate futures complex is up 17% from the start of this year.","In addition, with equity markets getting slightly more active, particularly in the non-U.S. products, we saw equities derivatives business expand year-to-year, with solid performance in our MSCI and Russell Index futures contracts.","I'd like to highlight our global listings business on Slide 18, where The New York Stock Exchange continues to lead in capital raising during 2014, including in technology IPOs. NYSE's IPO issuance in the first half of the year is trending above the 2013 record pace. It's up across all metrics, and it's up 38% in the number of transactions. The first half momentum has continued through July and into August with 14 IPOs raising $7.5 billion in just those 5 weeks. Year-to-date, over $28 billion has been raised in 82 transactions, and that has created $140 billion in new market capitalization. In addition, 26 companies have listed a spin-out or a carve-out business on the NYSE, with more than a dozen yet to come in the balance of the year.","I've had the honor to meet many entrepreneurs and business leaders coming through our building, and these IPOs are great moments in a company's history and are supporting overall economic growth. We continue to take a leadership role to advocate on behalf of our listed companies about the importance of an improved market structure. To that end, we unilaterally began reducing complexity and filed with the SEC last month to remove 12 order types and to harmonize all remaining order types at our 3 venues.","Both NYSE President Tom Farley and I testified in front of Congress this summer to ensure the debate is balanced from an issuer perspective. Later this month, the SEC's plan for pilot programs relating to tick size and trade-at are expected to be announced, followed by their implementation to measure proposed solutions. We're working with the SEC and with our peers to ensure that we're taking positive steps to improve market structure and reduce the complexity that market participants are faced with today.","Turning to Slide 19. I want to summarize our progress on our NYSE integration. However, before I begin, I want to make special mention of my counterpart, Duncan Niederauer, who led NYSE Euronext for 7 years through significant change and transformation in our industry. As he transitions from the NYSE at the end of this month, I want to thank Duncan for his leadership and recognize his shared vision for the future of NYSE together with ICE. In addition, I'm grateful for his mentoring to Tom Farley over many months, who became the President of NYSE in June.","On the slide, you can see that we've added some new accomplishments to the checklist on our call in May. We continue our customer-centric growth with new products and expanding our global roster of listed companies. We finalized what was a very complex reorganization to separate Euronext and Liffe and then completed the IPO of Euronext, which unlocks significant value ICE for shareholders. We migrated Liffe US to ICE, moving the GCF Repo, Eurodollar, MSCI and metals contracts to other ICE exchanges, eliminating both cost and complexity for our customers. You see we're on track to complete the sale of our Technologies business in the quarter, and our Liffe U.K. integration is progressing very well.","Our work to integrate multiple trading platforms for the U.S. cash equities and equity options exchanges is underway, and we've laid out for you the additional synergies available as a result of that and our continued work on the NYSE model. And we completed significant debt repayment and immediately began returning capital to shareholders, starting a repurchase program for our shares of stock.","This morning, we also announced that we've acquired certain patents and related ongoing patent applications that relate to calculating and making trading decisions, under terms that will allow us to license this intellectual property to others. These patents have been the subject of prior litigation, which resulted in firms having to pay significant settlement fees. ICE decided to make this purchase to allow us to more broadly protect our customers when they make trading decisions that provide liquidity to ICE and NYSE markets. We're currently developing our own licensing plan, and we'll be contacting our customers in the coming months with more information. So as you can see, we're not waiting for volatility to return or for business to come to us. We're bringing back our customers new solutions needed to trade, manage risks and comply with regulations at a very dynamic time in our industry.","By focusing on our customers' needs every day, we will grow. And in doing that, we will drive shareholder value. I want to thank our customers for trusting us with their business in the second quarter, and I want to thank our global team for delivering these results.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Andrew, our operator, for the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","The question's on Slide 11 and the capital return you outlined. So you can see the buyback of the $700 million over the next, what looks like, 5.5 quarters, until the end of 2015. And I think most would agree you're aggressive right out of the gate here. But looking at that $700 million, is that sort of written in stone? It looked -- it appears like it's about half the capability that we think you could buy back reasonably. If the stock stayed at these types of levels or lower, would you get more aggressive than the $700 million?","Scott A. Hill","Yes. I mean, Rich, you touched on a number of important factors. How and when the buybacks flow will depend on market conditions. It depends on timing of our cash flow. It depends on where our leverage levels are. But our expectation, the reason we showed you the chart, is that over the -- between now and the end of 2015, we think it's likely that we will buy back the $700 million. We will continue to pay the dividend. And as I step back and think about a payout of $1.7 billion, which is what that total would be over the course of '14 and '15, or even the $1.15 billion that will be paid out over the next 17 months, I'll let you guys figure out what your 2015 estimate is. But you're going to calculate that out to somewhere around 60% to 70% payout. I think that's very strong. I think we've been very consistent in saying that we are going to leave some capital so that we can continue to invest in the business, so that we can remain flexible to expand through strategic M&A, where the return on investment is appropriate. So it's not ever been our intent to calculate how much cash we'll generate and to pay 100% of that out. In fact, I think that leaves you in a position that when the right opportunity does come along, you've got to use an expensive currency like stock to go make a deal as opposed to having the cash and the debt capacity to do it.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Understood. That's very helpful, Scott. And I guess my one follow-up, Jeff, is the volume picture right now, the thing that is sort of impacting numbers is what's going on with the European interest rate volumes. And I guess I just want to get your opinion on -- do you think this is what you call extended period, where -- it looks like Europe is just starting to go into -- or potentially going into the QE phase that we're coming out of, and you see a big divergence between short-term interest rate volumes in Europe and the U.S. Are we in for something that's -- the stagnant volume picture, how long do you expect it to last over there?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, I wish I had that crystal ball. It's very, very clear that the short-term interest rates are highly driven by central bank policy and that you've seen the U.S. central bank policy moving U.S. short-term rates. We've seen now the U.K. central bank moving U.K. short-term rates and our respective volume in trading. And I agree very much that our euro-denominated interest rate complex is highly sensitive to what the ECB will do with short-term rates, which is lagging those other 2 central banks. That being said, we saw the opportunity to acquire a fabulous rates franchise, one of the best in the world, at what we think are historic lows in volumes and hopefully, ride that trend back up to the benefit of our shareholders and our customers. And we are going to use that footprint there to expand what we do in the financial markets, so we do not intend to be wholly dependent on European central bank policy as we build out our franchise.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Maybe first, Jeff, more of a big-picture question. The U.S. is moving towards energy independence. What are the implications for ICE's energy trading volumes? In particular, for Brent, does shipping east versus west change the way Brent is hedged to the benefit or detriment of volumes? For WTI, is shale oil going to be benchmarked to TI or to another marker? And how does that impact your business, both in WTI and Brent? And then, in gas, we see the longer-term benefits to volumes and what's going on in gas, but is there anything in the near term in terms of implications of greater gas production and consumption that would benefit or further hurt gas volumes in the U.S.?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, that's quite a good question. Thank you. I think, first of all, obviously, the United States has a huge opportunity to become more energy independent in terms of its supply resources. But becoming energy independent does not mean that we become disconnected from the world's pricing of energy. What we're seeing, for example, is a big influx of natural gas-sensitive businesses into the U.S., particularly petrochemical businesses in the Gulf states, refining of oil in the Gulf states, whose goals and objectives will include export of their finished products out of the United States into a world market. Those exports and participation in global markets for LNG and refined oil products will ultimately drive the value of the raw material back home here. You're correct in that shale oil is not a particularly -- is not particularly well correlated to WTI. WTI is a pipeline-borne oil. And the shale oil, because of the transportation infrastructure, is moving by truck and other means and is making its way into the Gulf. And oddly, it's probably more highly correlated with Brent, which is a seaborne crude that happens to also come into the Gulf. As a result of that, I would expect that the market is either going to want to develop a Gulf Coast crude marker, or it's going to -- or that the WTI marker itself will be modified to include other grades of oil to make it more correlated to where oil may come in the future in the United States. Or we may continue to see it trade as -- shale oil trade as a differential to some combination thereof. But that oil complex is so highly correlated and related. Both the WTI and Brent benchmarks are very important, and that's why we want to trade both. And I think all of this movement will only be more positive for our volumes because it's massively expanding, it appears, the footprint of energy-dependent users that are going to want to hedge these global prices. We see that showing up in the requests for user IDs and passwords and the increased demand for the data that we sell around these markets.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then just very simply, ICE launched a host of new interest rate products in Europe. They've yet to get meaningful traction. I know it's really early days. Is there any desire to get more aggressive here? And does central bank policy just make it harder for those to work, and is it just not the right time quite yet?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, you should know that the plan that we alluded to in our prepared remarks to integrate Liffe means that we intend to move all of the Liffe -- remaining Liffe European products onto a new matching engine and into a whole new installation that we've built using legacy ICE systems in Europe. And we've launched these new products on the old Liffe matching engine. And we have been telling our customers that that old system is going to be abandoned, and we have been working with that customer base to connect to the new system and to -- and they are actively doing testing right now and getting ready for a new launch. So to a certain degree, we launched those products because we wanted to be in the market, but they are severely handicapped by the way we've done it. And we would expect, really, our push into these markets to be contemporaneous with being on a more widely distributed and faster and more reliable platform that we have in the ICE matching engine.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Scott, just on the synergies and the expense outlook, just given the volume backdrop, I guess it's slightly difficult to kind of parse the synergies related to the deal and then just the core expenses given the revenue or the volume backdrop. But I just wanted to get your thoughts on how much flexibility or variability do you have in the model if some of these sluggish volumes, whether it's in nat gas rates, continue for some time?","Scott A. Hill","Yes, it's a good question. A couple of thoughts. So first of all, I think you got to remember that we do have a pay-for-performance culture. And as you've seen over the past couple of years, to the extent our results come in below where our expectations are, we've adjusted our compensation accordingly. I think if you look at the trend through the first 6 months, we're a little bit behind where we'd need to be to get to those objectives. As we monitor the second half of the year, if that doesn't start to recover, you'll likely see, just as you have the past couple of years, an adjustment on that level. And as you've seen in the past, that's not an unmeaningful adjustment. And again, I think it aligns our team and our shareholders because the pay is aligned with performance. And the second related thought is, and we said this a couple of different ways in the prepared remarks, is we do think this is a cyclical issue and not a structural one. And so what we don't want to do is overreact and start to cut off investments in things like ICE Benchmark or Singapore or Cetip, where we believe those are the future additional growth drivers that we're going to see. That notwithstanding, if the volumes remain soft for an extended period, we can look at dialing back a little bit on some of those investments. And then at the end of the day, if it does become more sustained, I look at it as we have a $1.5 billion expense base in over 3,000 resources, there's absolutely opportunity to get more efficient in that environment.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then quick follow-up just on the capital management or cash deployment. When you think about 2015 and even longer, like how should we think about, like, the dividend level versus increasing the dividend as earnings grow? I mean, is that the strategy, like a certain payout, or will you be steady state and focus on buybacks in the near term?","Scott A. Hill","Yes, that's the conversation that Jeff and I have and have had with our board and will continue to have to really look at -- I think embedded in your question is what's the optimal way to return cash to shareholders. As I've said a number of times, I think the great thing about the cash-generative ability of this business is we can return meaningful capital to shareholders and invest in the business and continue to do strategic M&A, so we don't have to pick one or the other. As we think about the capital return to shareholders, the mix of dividend versus share buyback really is going to depend on market conditions, on tax policy, on a number of factors. As we sit here today, I wouldn't expect a big change in the balance. The focus is, as is indicated on the chart, is on share buyback. But I wouldn't predict in '16, '17, '18, as you get out in time, I don't know what's going to be optimal at those periods, but we are committed to a meaningful share -- capital return to our shareholders.","Operator","The next question comes from Neve Alexander of KBW.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","If I could touch on credit derivatives, you had some nice revenue there. You've really seen that kind of re-base of the tiering as more of the Europe came onboard. But we're still a couple of years out of kind of regulation being fully implemented over there for the trading and the clearing. So can you give me an update on where you are now versus maybe where you think you can get to? And then what's going on with a futures product?","Scott A. Hill","Yes, I'll touch on the first part, Neve. So as I kind of mentioned entering the year, we were very encouraged by what we saw in our January CDS clearing results because we were seeing meaningful uptake from the buy side. We were actually even seeing meaningful uptake from some European customers in those results, and that trend's really continued. Second quarter dialed back a little bit from the first quarter, but as you know, there is an index roll in March, so the first quarter tends to be above the second quarter anyway. But as I look at where we are for the first half, we're trending right towards where I thought we'd be, which is probably around $90 million of revenue or so this year. That's 15% more than what we had last year, and that was 30% more than we had the year before that. So I think the trend is right. And I think you touched on an important point, which is we still don't have a mandate for European buy-side clearing. There's still a number of products. I talked about some of the products that we rolled out on sov, which adds to Turkey, and a number of others that we've done. So there's still a meaningful opportunity for more products. The European client isn't even mandated yet, and we continue to see growing interest from clients here in the U.S. So I'm not going to give you a number other than to say it was $60 million, then it was $80 million, and now it's on its way to $90 million, and I think the trend is up.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","And Neve, this is Jeff. With respect to the futures product, I think you are aware that we tried and failed to launch a futures product, and so we've gone back to the drawing board to figure out why we failed and what we can do to make a relaunch more successful. And it's really two things. One, we're redesigning the product, and that's largely complete. We've had huge amounts of customer consultation to get input into exactly what the market thinks would work. And secondly, we're really waiting for the timing, and it was somewhat implicit in your question, which is we're looking to launch a true futures contract, in other words, a 2-way bid\/offer, continuously traded, completely transparent, highly liquid contract. This is not a swap future. We already have a dominant position in the swaps market, as you know. So the question is will the market want to transition fully to a completely transparent liquid, 2-way bid\/offer market. And we believe the market wants to do that. People are interested in that. And the question is what is the timing, and it will largely be driven by the need to get -- to move forward due to regulation and Basel rules kicking in. That all being said, we think that, that launch is probably this year still and that the market will support a launch later this year as people are starting to think about 2015 and 2016 organization of their trading activities.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Appreciate the update. And for my follow-up, if I could just come back on the capital distribution. Just because you have such powerful cash earnings and you have been acquisitive [indiscernible], even before the NYSE deal, with smaller ones that you can kind of fund as well. But if you don't come across some deals or some M&A, is there additional capacity over and above kind of the guided $750 million of potential share repurchases, like if you don't come across some deal opportunities?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","I think the way we approach M&A is we always look at will it meet our return on invested capital thresholds. And actually, that's historically how we looked at buying shares of ICE, and we loved having the opportunity in the past to buy on dips. So I think to the extent we have excess cash here, we'll be thinking what is the best and highest use for shareholder value and where can we deploy that, either through our own share buybacks or possibly some other person's share acquisitions. But the point there being that we will deploy that capital for high shareholder returns. I don't think we're going to be hoarding it, if you will.","Scott A. Hill","And just, I mean, 2 metrics you guys may be interested in. The payout ratios in our industry average around 60% to 70%. And again, you do the math. I think that's what you're going to see we're talking about. In the S&P 500, something closer to 30%. So it's not an unmeaningful payout ratio that we're talking about.","Operator","The next question comes from Alex Kramm of UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I just want to come back to the volume picture, and I know it's been asked several times. And obviously, you proactively talked about the whole structural versus cyclical, and I agree with the cyclical side. But you're also very quick to point out the log-ins continue to go up and so forth, so very much appreciate it, but can you talk a little bit about the negative side? I mean, there are going to be -- there are some structural things that I'm sure you see and maybe some things you can even share, like has the market participation of certain members changed at all? In the energy side, something that we're hearing all the time is that there's no liquidity on the long end of the curve anymore. I know a lot of your trading is short end, but it's got to impact the market. So maybe give us a little bit of the negative things you see as well.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Sure. Look, there's no question that there's -- particularly, starting with commodities, where you targeted your question, there's definitely a change going on as assets are coming out of banks and people are coming out of banks. And we see those assets going to sort of a more highly identified new class of holder, which are these merchant energy companies. These companies have been customers of ours for a long time. We know their senior managements very well, have ongoing dialogue with them, but many of them are really now emerging as very large, significant players in the global commodity arena. And they are putting assets together. They are active hedgers. And what we've seen is open interest going up, and as soon as there's any hint of volatility in the market, there's just an amazing explosion of volumes. I mean, the kind of volatility that has driven our record Brent volumes, for example, has not been particularly huge. I mean, if you really look at the price of Brent, it's actually pretty amazing how with all the global conflict going on and given where the conflict is going on, that Brent's absolute price remains in a range that is reasonable to most of us as consumers. So it doesn't take a lot of volatility to really spike volumes for us, and that's because these assets and traders are sitting, waiting for volatility. We have also seen this trend where traders in Europe, for example, who are professional traders and are not seeing as much volatility in Europe, are coming cross-border, and they're looking for volatility. So we see people moving from their traditional asset class into other asset classes as they seek volatility to trade. And I see that trend in our own markets. I can see it in subcontext in some of our competitors' numbers as well. But again, that says that these people are there. They're ready. They're poised for when their traditional markets come back. They're not leaving the market. That's why we keep getting this sense that this is -- while there are some structural changes that are going on in terms of volume capability of the market to use risk management services that we provide, it's sitting there, ready to go. And that's why we continue to build out a product suite for those people.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And then, I guess, staying on the volumes, and I know someone already asked about the interest rate business, and I think you talked about, obviously, the ECB action or nonaction, whatever you want to call it, but is there anything else you'll be looking for to maybe accelerate the business, either because of new products? But also, is there any -- when you talk to traders, is there a sense that maybe, in a couple of months, even if we stay in this environment, the market normalize and some volumes that might be depressed right now are coming back, or even, let's say, if the U.S. or the U.K. is getting more active in terms of rate hikes that it actually impacts trading in ECB-related products as well? Or is it really wait until the ECB does something, in your opinion?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","It's a good question because when we talk to people in the markets, there is a sense of forbidding that it feels like something is going to happen, but no one can tell what. And I think broadly, as you read articles about the markets, that you see a lot more bearish sentiment coming in and people talking about -- that there are unintended consequences of global economic and central bank policy that are yet to be discovered. And when we talk to people, that's kind of the sense and a lot of traders trying to come to understanding of what -- where the next risk management issue may arise and positioning themselves for that, which is why I think open interest is going up. I mean, there is positioning going on that is anticipatory of some kind of change. It's not anticipation of flat-line central bank policy into the foreseeable future. It's setting up for an unintended consequence of that policy.","Scott A. Hill","And I mean, to a large extent, we're setting up, too. The earlier question asked about the new products we launched, we're launching new products. We're building out clearing capabilities. We're building out our rates franchise generally. So while we can't necessarily do anything to make rates move right now, we're definitely not waiting or sitting on our hands. We're investing to build out the franchise so that when all the things Jeff just talked about start to flow through, we're well positioned with a very comprehensive rates offering.","Operator","The next question comes from Kenneth Hill of Barclays.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","First one I want to start with, I was hoping to get a little bit more of an update on the Benchmark Administration. You guys recently assumed some administrative roles for some of the ISDA benchmarks. You've got the LIBOR in there. So what's the kind of outlook for that? How do you guys think about monetizing some of those opportunities longer term?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, it's a good question. So we've been making significant progress on those businesses. We like those businesses because we're really starting -- we're starting with a nucleus that we think we can grow and build as opposed to acquiring mature benchmarks, which are trading at very, very significant valuations right now. What we've done so far is we started by moving LIBOR into our own auspices, and then just recently, we have now launched technology that will allow data gathering to come in and be more automated and auditable. We are still gathering the kind of data to create LIBOR that people have criticized. And the next step is to expand the way LIBOR is calculated to include more transactional data, correlated transactional data. And there is a process going on right now with an advisory group that is very, very broad and industry representative of what the next changes will be. But we needed to get the product moved over to ICE and then get the infrastructure in place, which it now is. So I think you will start to see the true evolution of LIBOR along the vein that the market is calling for. ISDAFIX has now moved over to us again. It's early days. We're just getting started. We intend, again, to gather transactional data to improve ISDAFIX. That means that we're going to be receiving data from a number of the MTF facilities there. We're working to automate the trade capture of that and analytics around that, that we'll use to publish ISDAFIX. With respect to the monetization of those things, we began a licensing program that we've rolled out. It's caught some people by surprise. It's interesting. There has been a lot of criticism by people that they wanted LIBOR to be better, but then when they're asked to pay for it, they're surprised. It shouldn't be a surprise. These are relatively modest licensing fees for major users of LIBOR. We've started that licensing program right now. We continue to take input from people. We're fine-tuning it. We're finding -- it's amazing how broad the use of LIBOR is in the world, so we're getting a lot of feedback from different kinds of users on how they use LIBOR, and that's informing our licensing practices, which we continue to evolve. So you'll see that. It's going to take multiple years for all that, I think, to roll out and start to bed itself, but that process has been started by us.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Appreciate all the color there. I guess my follow-up would be kind of another development area. You mentioned in your prepared remarks some of the upcoming ICE Clear Singapore launch. I'm kind of wondering what your outlook is for that, kind of what the customer feedback has been as you've been laying the seeds for that and how we should think about it going forward.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","It's great. I've been there a number of times myself to talk to customers, and we have people on the ground that are working every day in that regard. There's actually a lot of excitement around this launch, and I mean that genuinely. There are some very, very interesting risk management opportunities in Asia. There are geographical issues and tax issues and political issues that really drive the way those businesses work throughout the Asia region that certain types of contract designs may be able to solve and therefore, provide meaningful volume to us and meaningful risk management tools to the market. So there's a lot of input going in right now on opportunities, things that we have never thought of ourselves, never dreamed of but that our customers are bringing to us as tools that they would love for us to offer. We've got a very good team there. Now we've been building it out. We're putting our own people in place, working very, very closely with the regulator, going through with the regulator a litany of product offerings that we intend to launch and setting the stage for the regulatory approval of those things. So we'll have more to say about it as we move through the year, but progress is going well, and we're really, really fortunate to have that infrastructure there under our banner.","Operator","The next question comes from Jillian Miller of BMO Capital Markets.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just wanted to get your thoughts on CME's acquisitions of Trayport. And from your perspective, does this impact your competitive positioning for energy in Europe? Specifically thinking, does this give CME some advantages, especially when going after new products that may be transitioning from OTC to more standardized futures, kind of like European nat gas?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, thanks for the question. First of all, whatever process the Board of Directors went through to sell that asset, we were not a part of it, so I really have not looked at that business particularly closely. We were not afforded the opportunity. But that being said, we've paid a lot of attention to comments that have come out around that acquisition and are confused, I would say, at best. We're hearing and have been told directly that the company is going to run as an independent autonomous unit, and that message -- and those drums seem to be being beat, but then -- and that is the message that's being delivered to us and other users of the platform. But then separately, shareholders are being told that it's highly strategic, that it's going to provide a lot of information and somehow inform how new futures contracts and clearing will be done by its owner. And those 2 things are in direct conflict. And so until we see what remedies are going to be put into place and how that business intends to be managed, it's very, very hard to answer your question.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, fair enough. And then just moving over to interest rates. You have launched a bunch of new products and moving forward with some of these benchmark administrations. And the one thing that we haven't heard a whole lot about is interest rate swap clearing. And I know, obviously, you've got a lot on your plate with the transition and technology changes going on, but I was just wondering what your plans are there. Is it still something that you guys are thinking about offering? And if so, like what's the timeline? When do you need to start working on that?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, we don't have anything to announce today, but I will tell you that we want to have a rates franchise, and we're looking at where are there parts of the market where we can do something that's incredibly innovative. We're not a company that just says, \"I'm going to launch another guy's product and pay for order flow.\" That's just not something that we've ever viewed as a market model. We like to figure out if there's something unique and novel that we can do that will really bring benefit to our customers. So we're having lots of conversations. I think, as was mentioned earlier in the call, the movement of the swaps business into clearing is taking probably longer than many have thought it would in terms of the regulatory mandates on how this is going to work right now. There is a large dialogue going on between global regulators about how global regulation of the swaps market is really intended to work and how information and oversight is going to be shared. And until there's a little more clarity as to how that's actually going to unfold, particularly between the U.S. and Europe, it's very, very hard to really get your arms around what a good OTC clearing franchise might even look like. We do think that those issues are on the table, they are under active conversation and that we'll have more visibility, I think, hopefully, by the end of this year.","Operator","The next question comes from Chris Allen of Evercore.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. I guess just one follow-up. I just want to follow up on kind of the expense outlook. Obviously, Scott, you noted the flexibility there as we kind of move to the back half of the year. You noted the first half top line was a little bit below expectations. Should we be thinking about, from a modeling perspective, modeling along the lines of your margin guidance for the year in terms of building in our expectations around the back half on the top line and then getting to that margin level? Is that kind of the right way to think about it?","Scott A. Hill","Yes, I mean, because I always hesitate to guide to a margin in any particular quarter. What we've said is we kind of expect it to be 48%, 49%. We're tracking that through the half. I don't think that's an unrealistic expectation as you look at the year. I think as you think about modeling, the important is -- again, if we don't see the business start to recover a little bit, there will be an adjustment in compensation. I can't call that right now or I would have booked it in the second quarter. But it's clearly something that would be a reduction to that expense forecast. I'll note, though, that we would then restore that in 2015, so it's not a synergy because our expectation as we enter every year is we're going to meet our objectives and pay 100% of our bonus out. But as you're modeling second half, again, I think we've given you some pretty clear guidance on what we think the quarters are going to be. It doesn't include any adjustment in the bonus, but again, if the business doesn't start to recover, the pay-for-performance nature of our compensation will mean that you'll see comp come down.","Operator","And the next question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Jeff, a follow-up on the oil markets, and I think you alluded to that as well that given all the geopolitical unrest, it is a little surprising that we haven't seen more volatility in the oil space. Why do you guys think that is?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","It's hard to know. I think the market is becoming, unfortunately, used to political unrest, particularly in the Middle East, and has never fully embraced, for example, a Urals or Russian marker as a way of calculating oil. The Russian oil production, just taken on its own, could be a global marker, but the market has never fully embraced that as a marker because of the geopolitical activity and has urged us to continue to develop the way the oil infrastructure is reported and risk-managed through other venues. And I see that kind of playing out right now. There's no question that the back end of the curve, if you look at price adjustments in oil, I think the back end of the curve is up something like 13% or double-digit, low double-digit percent. And so the market is sending some longer-term price signals that they do think that there will be supply impact as a result of what's going on here.","Scott A. Hill","Yes, and I think, I mean, just numbers-wise, again, July volumes were up 26% year-to-year, and for Brent, open interest is at record levels. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that translated to very strong energy revenue. So even despite a specific volatility change, I would suggest there's been a very evident interest change with the events that have occurred recently.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then a quick one, Scott, for you on the expenses again. When we think about the leftover expense savings, so call it $310 million, I guess, or so, which you'll see at the end of this year, what's the pace, I guess, of the recognition of these savings?","Scott A. Hill","Yes, I don't think we're really in a different place than we've talked about before. I think, as we enter into the first quarter, as we showed on the chart, I think we're on pace for $350 million of the original $500 million. I still think it's 90% as we exit '15, and so that will be reflected in the first quarter 2016 run rate. I think if you think about the $50 million additional synergies, my current expectation is you'll probably see us realize 30% to 40% of that as we go through 2015, with the remainder during 2016. So I don't -- the percentages don't move materially in terms of rate and pace, but again, I think we're well on track by the time we get to the end of 2016 to have removed the $550 million, which, as I noted, is well over 40% of the original NYSE Liffe expense base.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","And I think another way to think about it from an operational standpoint, which is how we run the business, is our next big move is to transition the European Liffe products onto the ICE platform. We're waiting until after the summer European holidays to begin that process, as soon as people get back in September. Work begins in earnest moving into October, November. Once we've moved those products over, we no longer need that platform and all of the support that goes around it. There will be people exiting. We also are selling off a number of technology businesses. Once those leave, their support people and others that have been left behind will be exiting. And so we're going to be going through a process as we reorganize these businesses, and it just sort of looks and feels like the end of the year, when a lot of that change will really kick in for us.","Operator","The next question comes from Dan Fannon of Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Actually, my questions have all been asked and answered.","Operator","The next question then comes from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So another question on the volumes. I'm really just wondering, as you guys see who's trading in your markets, how the commercial hedgers are actually behaving in this kind of low volatility environment. And the reason I ask is you wouldn't think that really depressed volatility would be impacting your activity, but you guys would obviously know better than me. Is there any light you could share on how that customer group is behaving? It'd be great.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, it's interesting. They're a part of our market, and they continue to be active in terms of gathering data and logging in and what have you and open interest levels. But the reality is that these are people that are -- the commercial guys are taking longer-term views on what's going to happen. They're not actively trading necessarily every day. So we do see them sort of setting up for some future event, which means buy open interest, longer-date it, and sit and wait for events. Shorter-term traders, liquidity providers and others that trade pure volatility as a result don't have as much to work against under that scenario. So that's why you see certain depressed volume, particularly in front-dated products.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Great. And my other follow-up would be European natural gas. I mean, I know it's a small market for you guys but clearly growing very nicely. Jeff, can you help us understand the market setup there, I mean, who the competitors are for European nat gas? And then how big do you think the potential market is as more of those volumes kind of migrate to exchange?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, it's interesting. One thing that may or may not be known is that when the EMIR legislation was passed, which was basically the Europeans' equivalent to Dodd-Frank, gas and power were exempted from clearing, the clearing mandate. So those have historically been bilateral markets, and they will, under the new regulatory regime, continue to be able to be bilateral markets. And so a lot of electric utilities and gas utilities that have good balance sheets have always continued to trade those bilaterally. What's changing is the way banks and other counterparties are margining each other in the bilateral market, and at some point, it becomes somewhat equivalent to putting it in a clearinghouse. And as people put business into a clearinghouse, we can look at their entire portfolio of gas, power and oil and related products and give them meaningful margin offsets. And also, the clearinghouse allows us to extinguish contracts. If you buy and then sell and put it in a clearinghouse, you have gone completely off-risk because we've netted the 2 and extinguished them, which is not the case in the bilateral market. So people that are paying more attention to bankruptcy concerns and the fallout of the MF Global collapse and the like are generally trending towards moving that business on exchange. We have lots of competition and new competitors seemingly announcing every day. So none of that can really detour us. It's why we bought the Endex exchange. We wanted the Continental European people and the infrastructure that have close relationships in that market, and all of that has really worked to our advantage and has helped us grow the business. I suspect we'll have people coming in. They'll be paying for order flow. They'll be doing all the nonsensical things that happen in other markets, but none of that really has seemed to have any negative impact on us. And frankly, some of it has probably, overall, expanded the market and, in a backhanded way, inured to our benefit.","Operator","And our last question today comes from Akhil Bhatia of Rosenblatt.","Akhil Bhatia","Could you just give us a sense on how much cash you expect to receive from the sale of the Technologies businesses and how much cash you spent on the patent acquisitions?","Scott A. Hill","We don't -- we haven't disclosed those amounts, Akhil, so unfortunately, I can't provide that. I will tell you that with regards to the NYSE Technologies sale, that's an additional source of cash that we'll be putting to good use, either through capital returns or investments in our business. But we haven't disclosed those amounts publicly.","Akhil Bhatia","Okay. And then just a follow-up. What types of M&A opportunities are you seeing out there? Is there anything you're particularly focused on? Or what are you seeing out there?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, there've been a number of -- we've been invited into a number of very sort of high-profile dispositions, particularly a number of things by banks and others that have gone to auction. We have declined to participate in a number of them simply because we haven't been able to meet our return on investment thresholds. And some of them have been amazing franchises and very interesting things, but we don't feel like we should destroy shareholder value in order to own them. So it does seem to be a pretty active market for things that are coming up for sale or what have you, but we really haven't necessarily been participating. We have a buy-versus-build strategy around here, so we look at where do we want to go, and then once we determine where we want to go, we figure out how quickly can we build it or are there parts of it that we need to acquire from others and are those available to us. And so that's really what drives our thinking here. And it's worked well for us and created a lot of value for shareholders over a period of years, so nothing has changed in that regard. But it has been interesting to see sort of some of the high prices that have been discovered for some of the other assets that have traded recently to our peers.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, for any closing remarks.","Jeffrey C.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Kelly Loeffler, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications.","Kelly L. Loeffler","Good morning. ICE's fourth quarter 2011 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investor section of our website. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. ","Today's remarks may contain forward-looking statements. These statements represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements. For a description of the risks that could cause results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our Form 10-K, which is filed with the SEC today. ","The results presented today include our adjusted operating results. We believe that these are more reflective of our business performance. A non-GAAP reconciliation is included in the earnings materials. We explain why this information is meaningful and how management uses these measures. ","With us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Chuck Vice, President and Chief Operating Officer. ","I'll now turn the call over to Scott.","Scott A. Hill","Thanks, Kelly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We had a good end to another record year in 2011 and we're off to a very solid start in 2012, including January revenues that were up more than 10% over the prior year. ","I'll begin this morning on Slide 4 by reviewing our full year 2011 results. ICE grew consolidated revenues 15% to a record $1.3 billion, our eighth consecutive year of revenue growth at\/or above 15%. ","Each segment contributed to our performance with ICE's future and OTC revenues increasing by 20% and 10%, respectively. ","Strong top line, coupled with disciplined expense management, delivered expanding operating margins and a 25% increase in adjusted earnings per share. ","These financial metrics distinguish ICE from our peers. Our operational achievements were equally strong. In order to continue to drive long-term growth, we expanded our post-trade footprint, we made strategic investments in Brazil and we added hundreds of new products for clearing, including sovereign CDS. ","We executed on this diverse range of initiatives while delivering record operating cash flow and increasing our return on invested capital. ","ICE's consistent growth is the result of our willingness to solve complex problems and to invest in growth-oriented initiatives in a disciplined manner throughout the economic cycle. ","Let's now move to Slide 5 while I discuss our fourth quarter results. Revenues rose 15% over the prior fourth quarter to $327 million. Combined with expense growth of just 5%, operating income grew 23% to $195 million and operating margin expanded 4 points to 60%.  Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 30% to $1.76. ","For 2011, CapEx and capitalized software totaled $88 million and cash flow from operations were up 34% to a record $713 million. You'll also note that our full year tax rate came in at the low end of our guidance and our fourth quarter rate was only 29%. This is not the result of any single or fleeting factor. We continue to see strong growth in our non-U.S. businesses and U.K corporate tax rate continues to come down. Thus, we expect our tax rate for 2012 to be in the 28% to 31% range. And to be clear, as our tax rate improves, so does the net income we deliver for our shareholders. ","Revenue and expense components for the fourth quarter are detailed on Slide 6. Starting on the left side of the slide, transaction and clearing revenues grew 14% to $287 million. Futures revenues grew 13% to $143 million. OTC Energy revenue increased 18% to $103 million and credit revenues grew 10% to $41 million.  Finally, market data revenues increased 18% to a record $33 million. ","Moving to the expense side of Slide 6, you can see that operating margin improvement was driven by modest increases and expenses. Core operating margin increased 2 points to 65%. You'll note that we provided additional detail on the expense side on this slide including a new line item for our technology and communication expenses, which we've separated out from SG&A. Given that it was the largest component of SG&A and that many of our growth initiatives contain technology elements, we believe that this information will further enhance shareholders' understanding of our expenses. ","We maintain a lean expense structure while we invest for future growth. Regardless of the global economic climate, this ensures that our spending remains focused on those initiatives that generate returns. ","Based on our current business outlook, we continue to expect double-digit revenue growth in 2012 coupled with modest expense growth, which means profit should once again grow faster than revenues. ","Specifically, we expect that expenses will be up slightly on a GAAP basis and up 3% to 6% on an adjusted basis, including compensation expenses rising 6% to 7%. ","We've included additional financial guidance in our earnings release, so please refer to it for more detail. ","Let's turn to Slide 7 and review the fourth quarter performance of ICE's future segment. Volumes grew 11%, generating a 13% increase in revenue. Average daily volume at ICE Futures Europe grew 22%, contributing to the exchange's 14th consecutive year of record volume. This is further confirmation of the rising importance of our benchmark contracts and the critical function they perform around the world. ","ICE Brent and Gasoil futures and options posted average daily volume growth of 36% and 21%, respectively, during the fourth quarter. ","In January, the Brent contract achieved an important milestone, reaching $1 million contract in open interest. ","Conversely, WTI volume has underperformed as idiosyncratic issues with the contract have made it less useful for hedging for customers with international price exposure. ","ICE's emissions contract also continued to perform well as volumes grew 51% and open interest grew 26% over the prior fourth quarter. ","In our North American futures market, volumes decreased slightly in the fourth quarter with demand in ag markets lower primarily due to European financial market conditions. ","Russell Index volume was up 30% and open interest grew 25% on the back of heightened levels of U.S. equity market volatility during the fourth quarter. Volume in the U.S. Dollar Index grew 11% year-to-year. ","Last week, we reported a 6% decline in futures volume in January. Though average daily volume was up 36% from December levels, volumes were restrained by lower volatility, particularly in the WTI and sugar markets. However, improved revenue capture resulted in solid futures revenue growth in the month of January. ","Turning to Slide 8, I'll review our fourth quarter OTC business starting with energy. OTC Energy average daily commissions were $1.6 million. North American natural gas revenues grew 23% to $67 million. And importantly, open interest grew 91% compared to the prior fourth quarter continuing a trend seen throughout 2011. ","Global oil revenues increased 65% to $13 million as a result of solid traction and new cleared products. ","In 2011, we launched 260 new cleared OTC Energy swaps and we now offer 650 cleared OTC Energy contracts. New OTC products generated $38 million in 2011, nearly double the $21 million generated in 2010. We believe demand for our cleared OTC products will continue to increase as regulation in the United States and Europe progresses. ","Into January, we've seen continued strength in average daily commissions which surpassed $2 million a day during the month. Trading activity in our natural gas business was solid throughout the month of January and into February as a result of new products and more importantly, volatility. ","While we caution against extrapolating this level of activity across the entire year, we believe the fast start reflects the importance of volatility, rising open interest and product innovation versus the absolute price level alone. ","Turning to our credit derivatives business, fourth quarter revenues were up 10% to $41 million. CDS clearing contributed $18 million, up from $15 million last year. Creditex revenues were $23 million in the quarter, up 2%. Notably, 69% of Creditex's revenues came from electronic offerings versus only 53% a year ago. ","During the quarter, ICE Clear Credit became the first clearing house to clear sovereign CDS with the addition of 4 Latin American names. We continue to lead in CDS clearing and continue to support the evolution of the industry. Clearing is a critical step in the evolution of the credit derivatives market. Having cleared over $27 trillion in notional value to date, we believe clearing is contributing to the liquidity and recovery of the credit market. ","I'll conclude on Slide 9 with a few additional metrics that highlight our consistently strong performance. In 2011, cash flow from operations increased 34% and we ended the year with $823 million in cash on hand. With effectively no debt net debt, a strong balance sheet and access to nearly $2 billion (sic) [$3 billion] in credit facility, we have flexibility as we evaluate ways to continue to build value for our shareholders. ICE has improved our return on invested capital each of the last 3 years and remains the only major U.S. exchange to produce returns above our cost of capital. This is a critical distinction. For firms who are unable to achieve returns above their cost of capital, returning capital is an obvious choice. However, as long as ICE can effectively invest in strategic growth initiatives which provide appropriate return, we will continue to deploy our capital in a disciplined manner to create increasing value for our shareholders. ","To further validate our approach, we screened the S&P 500 to search for other companies with similar performance metrics. Among companies in the S&P 500 to have a 5-year average revenue growth rate at\/or above 20%, ICE is one of only 14 companies that also has generated returns on invested capital above 15% and that is expected to deliver double-digit annual earnings growth for the next 3 years. Make no mistake though, ICE returned $175 million of cash to shareholders in 2011 via share repurchases. And we still have another $334 million available under our remaining repurchase authorization. We will continue to act opportunistically to repurchase our shares when the price disconnects from the fundamental value of our company or when the purchase of ICE shares is more attractive than other currently available alternatives. We believe there remains ample opportunity in our industry to grow our business and we will continue to be disciplined and deliberate when opportunities arise to deliver the next stage of growth. ","I'll wrap up my comments by stating that we are confident in our strategic and financial position. We are focused on delivering meaningful value to our shareholders and solutions to our customers. And with January revenues up more than 10% over the prior year, the momentum from a solid 2011 has continued into the first quarter of 2012. ","With that, I'll be happy to address any questions during our Q&A, and I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As you just heard from Scott and you can see on Slide 10, our consistent growth across each of our business segments continued in 2011. This performance has produced 6 consecutive years of record revenue and record net income, setting a new record year each year that ICE has been a public company. ","To that end, this morning I'll review the drivers of our performance and then provide our perspective on 2012 and longer term. ","Turning to Slide 11, we detailed the secular trends that continue to drive growth in our markets. From our positioning in the commodities market to growing demand for risk management and the increased use of clearing and technology, we're meeting the global demand for more of these services. We've managed the company's expansion deeper into the derivatives market to ensure that we're well positioned in the context of these trends. ","ICE's culture remains one of anticipating customer and market needs, particularly given our focus on the end user. We've invested in clearing and post-trade businesses when they were not well appreciated or understood. In particular, we saw the need in the OTC Energy and credit markets and our team built both ICE Clear Europe and ICE Clear Credit despite concern and doubt that it could be done. ","We've also implemented greater regulatory controls in our markets over the past decade. Following the implementation of position limits in our key U.S. energy contracts in 2009, our markets continued to grow and are at record levels of volume and open interest. Our OTC market model for both clearing and execution has served as a framework for financial reform. ICE has successfully navigated and in many cases, introduced change. We continue to evolve our markets alongside of our customers and this partnership strengthens our position today. ","On that note, if you'll turn to Slide 12, we've included statistics on our customer base that help explain our growth. The first chart shows that nearly half of our revenues in 2011 came from outside the United States, up from 36% in 2009. With our global reach and established infrastructure, we believe ICE has exposure to more opportunities. ","Our geographic diversification continues to serve as a catalyst for growth. It's driven growth in our customer base, which is illustrated on the second chart on Slide 12. And this, in turn, drives trading and clearing volume. This could be demonstrated in a couple of ways. In 2010, connections to the ICE platform averaged 8,000 per day. At the end of 2011, we averaged 10,000 daily connections. And you should note that a single connection may represent one or many more than one users on the platform. ","Similarly, in our OTC natural gas markets, the number of companies transacting has grown each year. 11 years after the launch of our OTC natural gas markets and amid consolidation of our customers and the financial crisis, we continue to grow this business. ","On Slide 13, you can see the volume trends in our energy markets. First, in oil, Brent and Gasoil have become widely relied upon benchmarks for global crude and refined products. And while WTI futures volumes are down sharply this year across both energy exchanges, we continue to view this contract as an important U.S. benchmark. However, ICE Brent prices the majority of the world's physical oil and we see increasing demand for Brent by major oil exporting and importing countries, commercial firms and commodity indexes that track the price of oil. ","With our open interest surpassing $1 million contracts for the first time just 2 weeks ago, we see strong evidence of the increased use of Brent for hedging and trading. And coupled with Gasoil and our cleared OTC oil products, participants are benefiting from margin efficiencies by doing the portfolio of their business on ICE. ","Similarly, the volume trend for North American gas has been solid despite declining gas prices over the past year. It's our view that natural gas is becoming an increasingly vital North American energy input, which is driving interest in our products. There's deep liquidity, record open interest and strong market participation despite low price levels. Our average daily commissions exceeded $2 million a day in January demonstrating the help of trading in this market. ","We also continue to look for new products to serve the changing market dynamics. And in December, we announced the expansion of our Platts relationship in which Platts energy information services will be distributed via the ICE stream. This is just one example of the value that the ICE platform continues to offer our market participants. ","Because we continue to invest in our markets and provide more functionality, more products and more liquidity for our customers, our revenue capture has been increasing. ","On Slide 14, we've listed a few of our strategic initiatives and the results that they have produced. Some of these provide optionality longer term and others are more advanced in their contribution, but nonetheless, each is responsive to a demand or an opportunity that we see in the market. For example, new product development supported by ICE Clear Europe has generated meaningful incremental revenue since 2009. And despite a very challenging CDS market environment, our CDS revenues have increased. ","ICE's clearing services support our customers' regulatory requirements and we have a strong framework for clearing swaps that we believe remain unparalleled. We know that well-developed clearing capabilities are critical to addressing the opportunities that exist today. And to support the move to clearing, we've completed many clearing enhancements in the past year to improve capital efficiencies for our customers. ","We introduced portfolio margining at ICE Clear Credit, and last year, we completed a 2-year project at ICE Clear Europe to transition from third-party clearing technology on to ICE's more efficient proprietary systems. ","In 2011, we also expanded our foreign-exchange products and set volume records in the U.S. Dollar Index futures. We look to Asia, Brazil and North of Canada to meet the demand for clearing and commodity markets. And we've seen good progress with our BRIX partnership in Brazil with 70 participant firms and electricity volumes rising. ","Our strategic state in Cetip has provided further exposure to Brazil and we anticipate providing additional updates about that investment later this year. ","I also want to note our successful integration of Climate Exchange, which is delivering strong growth including 2011 revenues of $63 million. Taken together, this collection of initiatives leverages our unique and valuable infrastructure to offer new areas of growth. ","If you'll turn to Slide 15, I'd like to discuss a few themes that are top in line as we begin 2012. As always, there are uncertainties about what lies ahead. However, these uncertainties are often the very drivers of growth at ICE. Companies rely on our markets to hedge their risks where uncertainty exists, and we consistently deliver growth on top of growth and believe that, that will continue to be the case. We're investing in our markets to support their evolution and to grow them. To that end, we're leveraging our existing platforms, clearing houses and other infrastructure to expand their relevance even further. For example, our clearing houses will be used to clear many new products and ICE's eConfirm is being leveraged to establish a swap data repository. We also believe that our electronic platforms will be asset to serving at energy and credit swap execution facilities. ","We continue to work in the U.S. and in Europe to meet the needs of our customers as they comply with new regulation. In the past, we've highlighted a significant investment that we've made in leading edge surveillance systems, reporting and compliance tools. And as a result of our leadership in implementing regulation, our efforts to bring greater transparency to markets, ICE is well positioned with customer-centric solutions that are in place today. ","Following the bankruptcy of MF Global, we anticipate further rules relating to FCMs and clearing houses and believe that these will be aimed at restoring customer confidence and fixing the segregation framework. I want to note that in regard to MF Global's bankruptcy, we completed the transfer of customer positions last year and we continue to emphasize the importance of a timely return of customer collateral in working with administrators and trustees. ","Finally, we remain focused on delivering growth in a way that creates value for shareholders and opportunity for our customers. We again beat expectations in 2011 with a 25% adjusted EPS growth, 3 points of adjusted margin expansion and 19% returns on our invested capital. ","This performance was delivered by supportive fundamentals, our strong futures, over-the-counter and clearing franchises, coupled with new customers, products and geographies and highlight ICE's ability to execute. I hope that these differentiators that we have established for ICE are evident to you. We're levered to expanding markets outside the U.S. Our customer base and revenues are rising. And we have meaningful contributions from new initiatives. We're well positioned for financial reform given our role in the over-the-counter markets and with our clearing houses. Ours is a growth business and we see many opportunities for innovation and reducing the complexity of risk management in the global derivatives markets. And that's what's drives the ICE team to innovate and outperform. ","So on behalf of everyone at ICE, I'd like to thank our customers for their business in 2011. I'd also like to thank the institutional investors and the sell-side analysts who recently recognized me and our Investor Relations team. And most of all, I'd like to thank my ICE colleagues for delivering the best year in our history. I'm confident that 2012 will be another strong year for us. ","With that, I'll now ask the operator to open the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First, maybe, Jeff, I was hoping you could further flush out the comments that both you and Scott made on product development. I guess, first, how does the pace of introduction of new products compare over the next year or 2 to what you've done over the past 2 or 3 years? Because you've done so much in terms of, like, gas and power and oil and the OTC products. Can that pace of innovation continue? And if you could flush out a little more -- I know you touched on it a bit, but where you see your focus really being?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Sure. I think the short answer is yes, the pacing continues. There's a continued move, more broadly in trading generally to the derivatives space, and we've been particularly focused over the last few years in building out things like our options capability. So we have an opportunity to list options on many of the flat price contracts that we already have launched. And then we continue to find an nexus from our existing portfolio into highly correlated related asset classes that are going to be cleared for which people would really like the ability to have that portfolio margining offset. So the spider web continues to get bigger, if you will.","Scott A. Hill","And just -- Ken, just to give you a couple of numbers, we launched over 100 products in '09 and I think nearly 100 in 2010 and I mentioned the 260 we did this past year. And as I also mentioned, revenues last year were $21 million in OTC Energy, up to $38 million. So not only are we continuing to launch products, but we continue to see the products we have launched generate incremental revenues for us.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And then on NYBOT, it doesn't seem to be kind of keeping pace with the business in Europe in the OTC area on a volume basis. Again, Scott, you touched on it in the prepared remarks, but can you further flush out the dynamics playing out there? Like, is the MF bankruptcy having an impact there? And then how are you addressing the issues? You mentioned that revenue capture is up there, you're bringing on new clients. Is that the way you're kind of dealing with the lesser volume growth there?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Ken, this is Jeff. I know you directed that to Scott, let me just take a bit of it. First of all, MF Global started business in life as a sugar broker. And sugar is our #1 agricultural contract so there is a relationship between its bankruptcy and some of our customers that continue to do business through MF Global. The bigger impact, however, in our mind has been the restructuring of many European banks that provided trade financing to the agricultural market. And those banks have been pulling back that merchant financing. And this is not just financing of futures margins, but also of warehouse space and other things that really affect the agribusiness. What we have seen in the recent terms -- in the recent time, and I've read about this elsewhere so other people are seeing it, is that gap is being filled by new banks that are coming into this market so we have started to see a recovery. We see a recovery of our open interest coming back in sugar and, in fact, many of those banks are Chinese banks, which is quite interesting to us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I guess, the first question, just to go back a little bit, Scott, I know you were cautious on the above $2 million in OTC average daily commissions in January and I was wondering whether you could help us if $2 million isn't -- could you give us more color on what's driving the $2 million number, your opinion for seasonality versus volatility, versus new products so to give us a better feel of what we should look at the model if it's not, say, $2 million?","Scott A. Hill","Rich, not to be trite, but it's really kind of all of the above. I mean, there was a significant amount of volatility in January and that's always a contributor to good volume growth. Clearly, the new products are providing some substantial revenues for it. In particular, the options product that we launched throughout 2011 are seeing some terrific uptake. So I think it's really all of those factors that are contributing to the above $2 million that we not only saw in January, but are also seeing in the first few days of February. As I said in my remarks, I don't think you'd take that number and multiply it x12 for the OTC, but it clearly does indicate that it's a line build [ph] and you get into volatile period that the volumes and the revenues will follow.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Got it. You're making it hard not to model to that number, Scott. Just kidding. And I guess, my one follow-up, Jeff, trying to follow the breadcrumbs as you sort of referred to before. ICE has been probably arguably the most innovative in gaining traction in totally new markets. So with this OTC market, I see you're doing things with the swap data repository, eConfirm. You've talked about setting the box in the past. I guess, it's just hard for me to sit back and say you're not getting get more involved than what you already are with CDS in the OTC. So anyway, the question is where do you see the big opportunities and how was ICE positioned beyond CDS in -- with the Dodd-Frank reform?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","It's a very good question, Richard. It's obviously the thing that we spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about strategically and I think that the high-level takeaway is that the Dodd-Frank and EMIR and MIFID and the BFOE rule and Basel requirements and things that are going to follow suit in Singapore and throughout Asia are incredibly complicated for many of our customers and to the extent that we can show up with ready-made solutions that allow them to easily do business with us and we take care of all that back-end regulatory stuff for them. We think it will drive more business and make customers incredibly loyal to us. And so we have spent an enormous amount of time both participating in the rule makings that have been going on around the world, but then bringing that knowledge back and trying to figure out how we can make life easy for our customers because I think that, at the end of the day, where value will -- where customers will pay for value is if you can simplify this ruling.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo Securities.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So I want to come back on this issue on the OTC January volumes here. Clearly, very strong. Is power having a recovery in the OTC complex? I know we've had kind of 2 years of flat kind of power volumes and I know these tend to be correlated with GDP to some extent. We've had a recovery in GDP. So are you seeing recovery in the power business? And if not, what is the catalyst really to get that business growing again?","Scott A. Hill","Yes, the power business, I would say we saw some modest levels of recovery. The strength really continues to be in natural gas and then also in global oil. We haven't talked a lot about that, but our global oil business for 2011 is literally 3x the size of what it was back in 2009. That's another area where we continue to launch new products. So it's really broad based in OTC with, again, a bit of a modest recovery in terms of power. And power, similar to what we're doing in the other asset classes, we are launching new products, trying to get options and adding delivery points to try and get that business going a little bit more. But again, I would characterize the OTC performance as largely nat gas and oil with a modest contribution from power. One point I don't want to get lost on is we had a terrific OTC Energy month of January but other parts of the business that are also doing particularly well. Brent volumes are good and OI is good. I mentioned in my remarks that overall January revenues were up 10%. So it's not a one trick pony in the month, just as it's never been in any single year. It's really reflective of the diversity of the business that we've built. We don't rely on any one single contract to determine whether or not we can grow.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then, Jeff, this came up on the CME conference call, but I'd like to maybe get your perspective on what the CFTC is looking into in the kind of examination of the high-frequency trader impact in the futures market. I know you've been somewhat critical of those traders and I just wanted to get your input here on where you think that goes.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Sure. And I didn't listen to CME call so I don't want to -- I really respect those guys so I don't want to contradict them so I just have to give you my view and hopefully we're thinking alike. First of all, we value high-frequency traders. It's just that we haven't built a business that solely targets them. They're one of a complex array of people that exist in the market. They're an important element of the market, but they're not the only part of the market. And so it really seems, right now, that regulators are just trying to figure out what a high-frequency trader is, to define what that is and then to figure out the value of that liquidity in the marketplace and to look at whether or not there's any abusive practices, which we haven't seen because we do have a regulatory function here. So had we seen them, we would certainly be alerting people to them. But nonetheless, I think it just comes out of a lack of information. The point that I make to the regulators a lot is that if you encourage markets to splinter and you want to fracture liquidity, then the natural outcome of that will be for the market itself to try to reassemble that liquidity so that people can see the actual bid offers in the market. And so to a large degree, the growth of [indiscernible] trading has followed the growth of changes in regulation. And so I think it's good that government wants to take a look at what the cause and effect is because, to a certain degree, they have a strong hand in the growth of that business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Scott, I guess -- you mentioned this on your new comments around WTI. I guess if you could maybe expand a little bit on what's happening with the volumes there in January and whether that's more temporary and expect that to kind of come back as the year progresses.","Scott A. Hill","Yes, Dan, I mean, WTI volumes have been down, not just at ICE, but also in our competitors and I don't really think it's anything we haven't talked about before. I mean, they are issues that are specific to WTI that have been specific to Cushing. And I think the most fundamental factor is you no longer hear anyone except our competitors talk about WTI as the global benchmark for oil. And commercial customers who might have stayed with WTI because that was the easy thing to do over the last 12 to 18 months given the disconnect -- and as I said, showing off my English words, the idiosyncratic issues of WTI, they've had enough. And they've moved to Brent oil as the global benchmark. And I think you're seeing that in volumes. Again, not just on our exchange, I think you're seeing it in OI. And frankly, well, I do think that the WTI contract remains a relevant contract and you will eventually see some bounce back, I think you see in our share, which now every day is well over 50% of the oil, that Brent has established itself as the global benchmark for commercial customers and that's the people we build our business in.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Let me just mention to you that since part of our investor roadshow and our IPO was that we told our potential shareholders that we thought we could grow the relevance of Brent in the marketplace. And so I mentioned that only because we have had an active marketing program for many, many years to try to get people to pay attention to Brent. And in fairness to our competitors, we are probably cannibalizing our own WTI markets much more than we're cannibalizing theirs as we're moving people to Brent because we have visibility into who trades WTI on our markets. We also, as we moved into the options business more favorably, we have people that may have, if they wanted to do WTI business on ICE they might have carried it as a flat price future, but today are carrying a WTI position in options as a synthetic flat price position. And so we've also cannibalized WTI with our own options business.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then I guess, in terms of capital deployment in 2012, I guess if you can maybe give us a back draft of kind of what the M&A environment looks like from your perspective and kind of what -- how big or how kind of deep is the opportunity set.","Scott A. Hill","I think there's a lot of opportunity out there. There's going to be a lot of change that goes on as a result of regulatory change and the movement clearing, which was already in place before regulators tried to stimulate it. And some of these more recent events like MF Global, like continued concerns over the balance sheets of the banking system will create a lot of opportunity, I think, for services that customers need. I continue to -- I say a lot and sound like a broken record, I know, but I think there are some things that are mispriced in the market. I think a lot of -- there are some things that are overpriced that aren't going to survive and I think there's some businesses that, on their own, aren't going to be able to satisfy customer needs fast enough given the fast rate of evolution that's going on. And they may have to look for partners or other infrastructure providers to get them to where they have to be. So I'm relatively optimistic about the M&A opportunities that may come. We're, as you know, serve opportunistic when it comes to M&A and we also really believe that if we can build it, we prefer to build it as opposed to buy it. And so we run everything through that same sieve.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Roger Freeman with Barclays Capital.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just in CDS, can you just update us on where you are with clearing single names? I guess my understanding is on the financial EMEAs frequent large dealers are still not cleared and wondering what the obstacles on that are opposed to getting that resolved. And then just on CDS, in general, the revenue guidance, you didn't give it this time. I assume that it's just to give it plenty of variables for this year?","Scott A. Hill","Yes. So let me start on financials. You're right, we don't clear those. We've got a number of things that are in kind of development queue, if you will, for CDS. And the financials aren't one that's in the front of that line. There are some complexities with clearing CDS for the people who are the members of the clearing house. And you've seen how deliberate regulators have been whether it's EU sovereigns or providing decomposition model, which we did finally get approved for the sell side and then work can get approved for the buy side. And so we don't feel like right now is the right time to go and launch the clearing of the financials. We'll eventually get there. We cleared today well over 300 products and we're doing them in the order of where is the demand and where is the volume. Financials, clearly, is one with volume that we will get to. But it's not a friend of mine, if you will. On the CDS revenue guidance, you nailed it. It's -- fundamentally, there are a lot of moving parts as we go in 2012 just as we always do as we come on to each of these calls. As we have better visibility, we'll share that visibility. But within the span of a company that just did $1.3 billion, I don't want to try and project every $60 million to $150 million piece of the business.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Sure. Okay. And then just on your expense guidance for the year, is your sort of, the CDS and regulatory-related expense expectations, everything you're working on, is that growth in line with the overall expense? Or is it growing faster?","Scott A. Hill","The CDS expense is actually -- as I mentioned going into last year and I'll say it again coming in this year, we're managing those expenses down ever so slightly. And we've done a lot of the build in terms of the risk models. A lot of what we're through right now is approval on model improvement and approval on new products. But I think we\u2019ve hit a pretty good groove swing and are actually now driving efficiencies in that expense base as opposed to having to increment it. There's no question. All the moving parts around the regulatory landscape are driving expenses for us. As we consider what it means to be assessed and how we're going to build it and what are the rules in the clearing going to be and how we're going to adjust for it. So you'll see in our professional services. In our big uptake, you saw our overall guidance was 3% to 6% growth, which is relatively modest, but you'll see professional services continue to take long because we do have some legal fees and other associated fees related to the regulatory world.","Operator","And our next question comes from Chris Allen with Evercore.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to, I guess, ask a little bit about the emissions business. I guess there's a temporary auction platform tenders that are coming up for bid. I was just wondering what's the process there and kind of what the outlook is for that business currently.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Sure. We are -- we announced that we're going to participate in a tender. The tender is coming from Continental Europe and we're going to use our U.K. Infrastructure to respond to that tender. So I'll let you figure out whether you think, probabilistically, you should put that in your model or not. We are going to respond and it is an important business that we'd like to have. It's just that the dynamics of the politics of Europe right now are quite complicated.","Scott A. Hill","And as I look across where our emission business is getting done in Europe today, it's getting done on our platform. I talked about the revenue growth. I talked about the OI growth. As we've mentioned or we foreshadowed in prior years, you got the airlines coming on as customers in 2012. So as we go into that competition and we put forward our platform, we can demonstrate that we got a robust business with this operating today.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just wanted to come back on the CDS clearing question real quick. Clearly, on the sell side, you have been doing really, really well, but on the buy side, I think the open interest number has not really matched up that much anymore and obviously, it's very small in the context of the overall market. If I look at your competitors in some other markets, like interest rate swaps, CME and LCH, it looks like they're getting some real traction with, I don't know, like, 10, 20 buy side firms consistently clearing now, at least that's what we're hearing. Like, where is that on your end? Why is the buyer side not embracing CDS clearing as much? And what needs to change here?","Scott A. Hill","Based on the information I got in the CDS world. $11 billion, that's more CDS clearing by the buy side than any other platform. I won't challenge what you've heard in terms of the numbers that are actually actively participating on other platforms but I would suggest to you that's more inflated than anything, I believe, is occurring. Look, fundamentally, one of the big things that we need to do in order to get the buy side in is get the decomp model approved and just sort of the quick 2-second dive into the reef. All that fundamentally does is it says, \"We're going to take your single name, position, and we're going to decompose the index and the same thing on name, position and give you offsets.\" And as you can imagine, that's necessary for capital efficiency. We've gone to the regulators including the CFTC and the SEC who have approved it for the sell side and said that the buy side wants it, needs it. The buy side has spoken and written and said they want it, need it. I fundamentally believe that we will get that approval and when we do get that approval, that will be a catalyst for the buy side to come into our clearing.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Yes. Remember unlike a lot of our competitors, we have a clearing house if you decided to half of SEC and CFTC regulated because CDS is both SEC and CFTC regulated. So just clearing the index business in one clearing house and clearing single names in another clearing house doesn't make sense. So we have tried to move our offering as a combined, as Scott calls, decomposed offering that would give these tremendous margin offsets to a typical portfolio. And I think, as Scott said, we're making good progress there because deadlines are for -- government's own self-imposed deadline for wanting to get clearing available for the buy side approaching in 2012.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just very quickly. Similar topic, but on the energy side. Obviously, OTC Energy doing pretty well so far this year. Are you -- is part of the growth that you're seeing actually new participants also coming online because of Dodd-Frank, Basel III and all those other stuff? Or do you still think that people are still waiting there? I mean, I guess what I'm trying to say is people are always talking on CDS and interest rate swaps as a big opportunity with all these regulations. But do you think on the energy side, you could actually get very much surprised too? We're not seeing a lot of that yet.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Yes, look, there's no question, in my mind, we're seeing people move in the cleared -- our cleared OTC products. Again, I think that's particularly evident in the oil offering which is, I said, is 3x as large in 2011 versus where we were in 2009. You look at the metrics. When I started 5 years ago, I think we're in the low 80s in terms of the percentage cleared in OTC. We're now 97%. There's no question that the market has started to move. I still believe though that there is an opportunity for more participants to come our way as the rules are finalized and understood. And the other thing, it's not just in our OTC Energy business. You go over and look at ICE Futures Europe. Our natural gas volumes in '11 were 2x where they were in 2009. We've got a power contract that's starting to do a little bit of business. Our coal contract, our volumes are up 2x where they were in 2009. And again, those are in our OTC Energy group, but there are other contracts that were predominantly traded bilateral, but are now moving on to an electronic platform and into a clearing house. So there are clearly signs. I'd hesitate to say whether I think we've seen 10% of the opportunity or 40% of the opportunity. I will say we've seen meaningful uptake and I believe there's still meaningful participation to come.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Heinz with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","If I could just go back to the OTC Energy business for a moment. Thanks for the color you gave on January, but wondering if I could just get a little more information on kind of what you're seeing in the nat gas business and clearly the recent volatility in the commodity had boosted volumes. But how do you expect hedgers to behave if we kind of get to a new floor here in the commodity?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","This is Jeff. One of the reasons we wanted to mention this trend on our call was that we have a lot -- we're getting a lot of investor calls that were concerned that it's very low-priced natural gas, having a $2 handle on that was somehow bad for our business. The reality is the forward pricing curve, if you look at it, has expectations for higher prices in the future so people are trying to lock in low prices. There's obviously a lot of storage issues going on as people try to lock in these low prices and figure out where to store this gas. So there's a very good fundamental going on right now. I mean, there are predictions that gas could go very, very low in the spot market because of all the storage fundamentals. But longer term, the forward pricing curve is really suggesting this is a good time to be trading and that there's going to be volatility against expectations going forward. So if you had to extrapolate, we're suggesting don't take our current numbers and multiply them up, but the reality is there's a pretty good pricing curve out there that would suggest there's going to be a lot of active trading. We just don't want people to be disappointed at a $1.9 million fund.","Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","That would be awful. So I guess, it's more about the steepness of that curve than the actual -- than just the outward price of the quantity?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","There a lot of people that -- natural gas -- there are a lot of people that were -- that had a short on natural gas, were kind of waiting for it to fall. I mean, there was an expectation that things were going to happen. They seem to be happening now with this recent inflection point in terms of the activity of trading that's going on.","Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And if I could just -- on the follow-up, just kind of M&A real quick. Continue to read headlines regarding better leverage for the LME, but seems like most of the industry have sort of thrown in the towel on M&A at this point. So it seems like an ICE -- it seems like a time when ICE would historically be opportunistic. So I guess my question is, in your previous transactions with several co-ops like the IPE and NYBOT where a potential closure of the floor can kind of be a sensitive issue with the members, how would these discussions go and kind of how did you handle those scenarios?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Sure. Let me first -- I can't talk specifically about LME, our relationship with LME. But let me address your question, which is we successfully acquired these neutralized companies with an overwhelming vote of the members. And that was because we spent time hearing out their needs and addressing them in the deal. I think the LME is looking at itself and trying to figure out what its needs are, which is always a healthy thing for our company. And I believe that they could use a much better clearing infrastructure that would allow them to roll out more products more quickly. I believe they'll come to the conclusion that they have tremendous growth that's coming globally and to the extent they can get more global distribution. It would be a good thing for them. And I think that they're -- they are a company that is centered in London and I think that, that is an important element of their business going forward. So if I had to presuppose what the Board is going to be looking at, it would be those things, whether or not they do it because if they did make a determination to do anything, it remains to be seen.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just one question on the OTC Energy. Do you happen to have the open interest at the end of January?","Scott A. Hill","I don't think we've put that out. And it's not a new metric I want to start talking about every month. But again, I did mention in the fourth quarter that nat gas OI was up 91% over the prior year. Volumes remained strong into January. So we're seeing good open interest trend, generally speaking, without giving you an update on any single month.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. That's fine. And then, Jeff, I think -- when you look at how your position in most of the clearing houses, obviously, like from a structural standpoint given what's going on with regulation continues to be a net benefit. Given the issues around MF, there's some concern that depending on how regulations change, the pressures on the FCMs can place more pressure on the users in the market. So obviously, it's early in that process, any types of changes. But in terms of what can change, do you feel like there could be enough kind of market structure changes with FCMs, but the end users shouldn't see too much change or increased cost for them to do business?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","It really depends -- this is one of the things where the devil is the details. There's no question that there's going to be a large discussion about changing the FCM handling of customer-segregated funds. And in that context, the trend is for that discussion to have the clearing house take over some of the responsibilities that are right now borne by the FCMs. That, on its face, is probably a good thing for us as a clearing house owner in terms of being to provide more services for our customers. But in the absolute, if you actually take away all the incentives for an FCM to handle customer credit issues, you could really dramatically lower the risk protections that are in a clearing house, which would mean that costs are going to have to go up and they could go up dramatically for the end users. So it's when you step back and think about it, I mean the system can provide a lot more protection if people want to pay for them. But at some point, you have to decide if the juice is worth the squeeze. And I would submit to you is that if everybody prepaid for everything they did, there would be no risk in the system, but there would also be no reason to transfer risks. So there's going to have to be a balance down there. I do think that people on both sides are aware of that and will find a happy medium there. We have been advocating, by the way, that some relatively minor changes that we think are within the power of the CFTC and the United States, the FSA in the U.K. could help the current system without wholesale restructuring.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jillian Miller with BMO Capital Markets.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just want to get an update on your outlook for the credit broking markets through Creditex in 2012. Do you guys still feel like kind of the main headwind for trading activity in those markets? Is the uncertainty related to regulation in Dodd-Frank? Or at this point, the issue is more related to the banks just in terms of lower trading profitability and some deleveraging?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","I think to some extent those go hand in glove, but again it's a little bit of each. There's no question that the CDS market remains very uncertain of what the rules are going to be. That's never good for a market. We absolutely are seeing the size of trading debts in the CDS market shrink. If you listen to Goldman and Citi and other banks talk about their performance in the fourth quarter, generally speaking, their fixed income businesses were down significantly and they're taking actions to reduce some of those impacts, so it's clearly a soft market. But in that soft market, we're positioning ourselves for when that market comes back. As we said in our remarks, we believe that the clearing we're providing is stabilizing the CDS industry and ultimately will enable it to grow again. As we also mentioned 69% of our business in the quarter was electronic versus 53% a year ago. And so we're already moving more towards electronic and we're continuing to drive efficiencies out of our broker cost base even as we maintain leadership positions in most of the key single name and index products. So there's no question, Jillian, it is a soft market right now. One of the reasons we're not guiding on that right now is there is still a great lack of clarity on when it will recover, but we still retain a good deal of confidence that it will ultimately recover and we position ourselves to more than benefit from that recovery.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then, Jeff, I think on the last quarter call you had mentioned that you thought a lot of the drive behind some of the open access clauses in MIFID to -- would, I guess, wane if the New York and Deutsche Boerse deal were to fall through. I just wanted to see if that's still kind of the feeling you have and whether you've had any discussions with regulators recently that might give you an idea for how the regulation's progressing and just a sentiment surrounding it.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Sure. I mean the Deutsche Boerse and NYSE through its like franchise, had a very difficult time discussing this issue while they were in the middle of their antitrust reviews. But now they are able to turn their focus on, along with the rest of the exchanges, on providing a common voice on the risks of going too far with some of these proposed initiatives. And so I think that now we'll get a healthy dialogue going on, and I know that dialogue has started. I also think that there is a sense that there's not going to be a single dominant clearing house in Europe so that competition can be preserved and you see other actions going on in Europe around clearing that will further -- should they go forward, will further improve competitive landscape for clearing. And I think ultimately, once customers are satisfied that they have sufficient choices and sufficient competition in the marketplace, that they will also back rational reform. And I see that happening right now. So I feel like we're in a pretty good place right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Niamh Alexander with KBW.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Can I understand, Scott, the tax rate guidance a little bit better. I mean, what's changing here that it's moving significantly lower?","Scott A. Hill","Number one is on one of the charts we did in the presentation. We continue to see our revenue mix shift outside the U.S. Clearing, for us, is a business and we continue to capture a lot of value in our clearing house and ICE Clear Europe is our largest clearing house. So that means that, that revenue shift outside the U.S. is even more significant at a profit level. And then just in terms of something that you'd hope that other governments might look at as a benefit, the U.K.  Government is actually doing things to improve their tax rate to attract business. If you go back to 2008, their corporate tax rate was 30%. In 2012, it's going to be 25%. And it's proposed it could drop further as you move forward to 24% and 23%. Now the drop to 23% still requires some action, but a 5-point decline in a country where we're earning more and more of our profit is a big help to our overall tax rate. And as I said on the call, what that ultimately means for our shareholders is more dollars on the bottom line, more cash and greater returns.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And then if I could just go back to the MIFID thing. Jeff, I mean with half of your revenue now in the OTC business where, technically, I guess it doesn't enjoy any structural benefit from open clearing or not and -- doesn't that kind of position you relatively well compared to some others anyway if MIFID and its initial current proposal form does make it through to kind of require open clearing? Because technically, I guess, you have that right now in the OTC business that you have and we're not seeing kind of exclusive price pressure or anything there in that business. Does that kind of position you better than your peers? Is that a good way to think about maybe what the futures might look at?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","First of all, you're right on your premise that we -- the last time I looked, I think we've accepted trades from 140 different trading venues for OTC clearing. So we are not the exclusive venue for that business. And in many products we have a minor or maybe even a 0 market share in the execution business. So yes, we're well positioned. Yes, we understand those dynamics. I don't know if our peers -- I don't want to say our peers are not, however, positioned. This is something that we started in year 2001 and 2002. So it's about a decade-old model that we've been working under, so a lot of people have been able to look at it and see what we're doing and how we're do it and emulate it. And so we'll just have to see how well prepared they are. The thing that we have been investing in for the last decade is connectivity to our customers straight through processing, ways of getting trades in and out. We mentioned on this call we're going to make it easy to get into a swaps data repository. Through -- because of the work we've done with the CFTC, we already do reporting of the OTC business through large trader report into government databases. So a lot of the proposed Dodd-Frank infrastructure that's going to be required of OTC market participants is something that we have already built as a natural extension of our business and it remains to be seen whether others have been spending time in a laboratory working on that.","Operator","And next in line, we have Daniel Harris with Goldman Sachs.","Daniel F. Harris - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I just have a quick one here in Europe. We've seen a lot of changes in the banks and deleveraging has been a common theme that we continue to hear, inclusive of some of the things are on commodity trade finance with some of the large French banks seemingly exiting that business or at least getting a lot smaller. How do you think that impacts the commodity trading business over there? Or maybe more broadly among globally, do you see other banks coming in to fill that? And does that play an important need for trading in general?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","The answer is that you're right. We have seen and we hear a lot of anecdotal remarks about how European banks are deleveraging. Scott recently redid our own credit facilities which has a pretty broad syndicate in there, so we were firsthand getting knowledge from people that we have had a long relationship with, how they're thinking about risk inside their own companies. And we have seen a pullback by many of these continental European banks. There was a void in the market. It seemed like in the, I don't know, the third quarter or so, but we're now, more recently in the fourth quarter and into this year, we're seeing new entrants come in and what we find fascinating is a lot of Asian and particularly Chinese banks actively and aggressively trying to fill that void. So I think it's probably a temporary phenomenon, but it is interesting to see where the new money is coming from.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Casteleyn with Susquehanna.","Jonathan E. Casteleyn - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","It sounds like Creditex cost you 5 points of operation margin for the year. So I guess, in a double-digit revenue environment, what does fully loaded margins look like? Just wondering how much opportunity you think is left.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Yes, I mean, you're looking at a fully loaded basis. I'd tell you that the Creditex business on a cash basis was very modestly accretive. And if you look at EBITDA margins for the year, they were a little more of about 10%. So the business is contributing in its small way. But again, it goes back to the question I answered early. It's a very soft market and so what we're focused on right now is being efficient as we can in our brokerage business while we maintain our share and continuing to launch new electronic offerings and to move people towards those electronic initiatives. In the current market, that's what we think is the right strategic move to position us still when the market does recover.","Jonathan E. Casteleyn - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. Yes, I mean, I guess I was broadly talking about the overall complex margins. I mean, how much opportunity -- I mean, can we see 65% pretax for the complex, including all initiatives?","Scott A. Hill","Jonathan, I always hesitate to project where margins can go because as you've seen in the past, one of the things that we like to do is to go out and invest in the businesses that may be a little bit lower margin than our current business, but where we see an opportunity to grow those businesses and improve their margins. So at the end of the day, I don't believe in the 5 years I've been here Jeff has ever asked me to hit a margin target. He has consistently asked me to hit cash and profit. And that's what we focus on. Where I'm going to continue to focus is, as I said in our prepared remarks, our board objective is to grow profit faster than revenue and to keep those growing at double digits and margins are going to be what they are.","Jonathan E. Casteleyn - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay, that's great. And just my follow-up here, can you set some expectations on pricing within futures? I mean, obviously, a good drift to higher in RPC during '11. Is customer mix, do you think, at the most profitable level now? Or would you expect pricing to continue to kind of gather some steam in '12 or do you think we're going to flatline here?","Scott A. Hill","There's a risk of answering your second question in an also unhelpful manner. You never what mix is going to be in any given period, particularly in energy business. We clearly are taking some pricing action to reflect some of the new costs we're seeing from the additional regulation and rules and changes like that, that will stabilize and support some of the trends you're seeing in RPC. But in any given month and any given quarter, it's hard to predict what customer mix will be. What I would point you to is a history of very stable RPC up and down in any given month. But if you look over a year and really even over the quarter, it's been relatively stable. And as I said, some of the upward trends that you're seeing, I think we can hold on to as we move our way through the quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with ISI Group.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Jeff, obviously, your net of energy markets is very well. I just wanted to get your view on what you think pricing in volatility trends might be longer term past the summer both in -- we've seen Brent and WTI spread now, re-widen, obviously, to these different supply issues. And then also you mentioned supply and natural gas coming into the summer. Do you think these are temporary phenomenon over the next, say, couple of quarters? And do you think that would normalize as we get towards the end of the year and into 2013?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, it's really hard to project. But at a macro level, the interesting thing about the commodity business in general is that every new source of supply, whether it's energy or agriculture or metals, comes from an increasingly difficult place to find it with increasingly complex technology to get it. And none of that goes in a straight line. I do -- I'm -- and maybe I'm biased because I came out of a power industry where we had a lot of natural gas exposure, but the U.S. is in a really good position in terms of having new sources of natural gas but there are significant questions being raised about environmental impacts and other things that will mean that we will have absent starts in that market and all that will be reflected in price volatility. And we've got this continuing volatility in the Middle East where, obviously, our oil is. And couple that with problems in the United States with pipelines going the wrong place or wanting to get built or not being able to be built. And so all of that really -- supply and demand issue creates volatility and that's why people have to hedge on a macro level. There's just nothing that you can see in the future that's going to change that dynamic. If anything, it looks even more complicated.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","That's great. That's very helpful. And then, Jeff, you've also been correct on the -- on your speculation on M&A, global M&A, officially not working. What's your view on -- obviously, we'll probably see a reversion to smaller deals for the exchange industry over the next 12 months or so. But what's your view over the next couple of years in terms of whether you think that gets restarted? And then also your interest in building out your complex overall, more broadly into financial futures longer term.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Yes, I actually think M&A can be done today. I don't think anything has really changed in the history that I've been running the firm. M&A is always hard and I haven't been always right. By the way, I appreciate the compliment, but it's not true. The interesting thing is that they have to be well thought out M&A. It's no longer just -- I don't know if you could ever just say, \"This got to be Chairman. This got to be CEO. Oh good, we have a deal and let's go forward.\" I think you have -- there are a lot of constituents around the exchange space and all of their needs have to be met for a thoughtful M&A to go forward and I think that's always been the case. And that was the case in 2001 when we acquired the IPE, for example. So in terms of our own need, I like to tell people that we jumped into a stream and it's taking us someplace. And I'm not going to row upstream. We're going to row downstream and we'll see where it takes us. We've had a couple of attempts to get into financial futures that was -- our premise on trying to buy Chicago Board of Trade was to try to get into the clearing of OTC interest rates. Had we had that property at the time we had that vision, it would be interesting to see where we'd be today given the trends now in regulatory demands to clear OTC. We obviously expressed interest in the Liffe exchange with NASDAQ. So there have been opportunities going down that stream that we couldn't resist. But at the end of the day, I feel like our company is very global. You can see it in our numbers. I feel like we have really good distribution. I think we have a really good brand. I really like the people that I work with. And so it's really about whether or not something comes along in that stream that would meet our rate of return objectives. But strategically, I don't think we have to do some kind of a global deal.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Rutschow with CLSA.","Rob Rutschow - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I guess I'm sorry to keep harping on or going back to the OTC business, but the CFTC data that you guys provide or that you report to them wouldn't have necessarily suggested such a strong increase in natural gas activity in January. So I'm wondering if there's a disconnect there just in terms of data or if you're starting to see a different segment of trader come into the market. And so put it in other words, can you kind of categorize with the volumes are looking like in terms of the market participants in January so far?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Yes. I'd be honest with you, I haven't tried to compare the large trader report to what we've seen in volume side. I have to go back to what I've said earlier, which is what's driving the good volume growth right now is new product options in particular, volatility that we're seeing in the market and people trading around what has been a sustained buildable interest throughout 2011. Large trader reports are -- should be indicative, but they don't necessarily reflect the breadth of participation the market growth. There might be some small disconnect, but as I said, we saw this pretty consistently throughout the month. I mean, this wasn't a situation where we had 4 good days, 4 great days followed by average days. This was good day, followed by good day, followed by good day, which is trended right into February. And that typically means we're seeing consistent participation, not spikes and not unusual participation.","Rob Rutschow - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful. My follow-up question would be, it appears that CME is trying to develop some sort of web-based trading or sort of end-to-end trading for energy. How would you view that from a competitive standpoint? Is there a concern that they might be addressing an area that you guys are in a strong end? And then also how might that impact the inner dealer space and might that drive more activity to you?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, they're good competitors and smart people and so I'm sure they're going to be working on things that they think can do well for them. But we have built an infrastructure over so many years that is so widely distributed and frankly, CME lists all of products on Globex, which is the bulk of them, which is a really widely distributed, very well-respected platform. So I'm not sure it's about the platform. It is really about the millions of things to go into building a stream of liquidity and getting eyeballs to focus on our liquidity. There have been lots of attempts in the marketplace to launch electronic trading of energy against our platform. And Dodd-Frank may provide stimulus for others to try again, but the fact remains a lot of people have tried and failed and the reason is that it's a very good platform that has a lot of proprietary content on it and it's well priced. And these are sort of niche markets in many cases where the market itself has not wanted the liquidity to split. We are aware that it's up to us to constantly make that platform relevant. We haven't set on our royals. We announced that we're working with Platts on the Platts Global Alert. They're going on the platform a couple of years ago. We did a deal with Platts where the Platts price assessments were done using our platform. We brought a company and rebranded it and rolled out ICE mobile so that our platform has tremendous mobile capabilities now. We've bought a small company that had instant messaging technology called YellowJacket. We build that into the platform. So it is a platform that is incredibly robust and has earned desktop space, and I think it's going to be a challenge for people to dislodge. But nonetheless, I think there will be competitors that will try, as a result of Dodd-Frank or any other excuse to see if they can dislodge it. At the end of the day, we have a huge clearing franchise and to the extent liquidity is split, the odd impact of that is it creates arbitrage, probably increases volume and increases clearing revenue. So I'm not sure that it's particularly a negative thing to have more execution competition.","Operator","And at this time, I'd like to turn it over to our speakers for any closing remarks.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, this is Jeff. Thank you all, again, for supporting us in 2011. It was a great quarter. Thank you to our customers. I like to thank all of you on the call here who helped us get our story out throughout the year, and we look forward to talking to you again next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Kelly Loeffler, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications.","Kelly L. Loeffler","Thank you, Bethany. Good morning. ICE's fourth quarter and full year 2012 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of our website at theice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay.","Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. Please note that the numbers discussed today refer to our adjusted operating results, which we believe are more reflective of the performance of our business. You'll find the non-GAAP reconciliation in the earnings release and presentation, as well as an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful and how management uses these measures. The materials presented today reflect futures volume that has been restated to include previously cleared swap contract volume. For a discussion of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the company's Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC this morning. With us today are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Chuck Vice, President and Chief Operating Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Scott.","Scott A. Hill","Thanks, Kelly. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. Our performance in 2012 once again set us apart, as we generated our seventh consecutive year of record revenues and earnings. We demonstrated that it is possible to sustain growth on top of growth, even in a lower volatility risk averse environment. Amidst significant regulatory change, we've delivered responsive solutions based on our investments in clearing, technology and innovative products. This strong execution, along with positive secular trends, a market and customer-focused strategy and a global business model continued to enable our growth.","I'll start this morning on Slide 5 where I'll recap our 2012 performance. Revenues grew 3% to a record $1.4 billion on a 10% increase in futures contract volume. Net income attributable to ICE was $552 million, up 8% year-to-year. Operating margin increased to 61%. Diluted earnings per share rose 9%, and operating cash flow grew 3% to $733 million. We achieved many milestones over the course of the year. Brent became the world's leading crude oil futures contract. We provided solution for regulatory reform. We introduced over 150 new commodity products, and we expanded our options market with more than 100 million options contract traded in our energy and ag markets for the first time. And in December, we announced our plans to acquire NYSE Euronext to form the world's premier global derivative and equity market operator.","Moving to Slide 6, I will detail our fourth quarter results. Consolidated revenues were $323 million, down 1% from the prior fourth quarter. However, consolidated operating expenses were also down 1%, yielding operating income of $192 million, which was roughly in line with the prior year. Excluding our NYSE Euronext transaction expenses, adjusted operating margin was 62% and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 5% from last year's fourth quarter to $1.84. Importantly, we delivered this margin expansion and earnings growth even as we executed on a number of strategic initiatives listed on the right side of the slide. We expanded our efforts in the emissions, OTC FX and CDS markets. We transitioned our swap contracts to futures market, and we began developing the clearing solution for Liffe and reached an agreement to acquire NYSE Euronext. This performance demonstrates our ability to simultaneously meet our customers' needs, respond to market and regulatory evolution, advance strategic growth initiatives and innovate in our market to deliver growth and value to our shareholders.","Turning to Slide 7, you can see the detail of our revenue and expense components for the fourth quarter. Transaction and clearing revenue were $277 million, a decline of 4% year-to-year as market participants remain cautious against an uncertain political, economic and regulatory backdrop. Volatility was also relatively low in virtually all of our products though Brent, emissions and ag grew at a healthy pace. Market data revenues grew 14% to a record $37 million in the fourth quarter, demonstrating continued demand for the commodity markets we operate. Our OTC credit revenue, while down from the prior fourth quarter, improved sequentially to $36 million, including $19 million in CDS clearing revenue. And during the quarter, ICE Clear Credit set a daily record of $14.5 billion in notional cleared.","On the right side of Slide 7, you can see that operating expenses declined 1% to $131 million and operating margin was 59%. Excluding $9 million of expense associated with the NYSE Euronext deal, operating margin expanded from the prior year by 2 points to 62%. For 2013, as noted on the lower right side of Slide 7, we expect adjusted operating expenses to increase in the range of 3% to 5% compared to our 2012 adjusted operating expenses of $527 million. The expense guidance excludes expenses related to the NYSE Euronext deal and some duplicate rent expenses expected in the first half of 2013, all of which will be excluded from our non-GAAP expenses. This information is included in the guidance section of our earnings release.","Please flip to Slide 8 where I'll review the fourth quarter results for our futures products. Revenue declined 2% over the prior fourth quarter on a 1% decline in average daily volume amid a risk averse environment and lower volatility across most of our asset classes. Within our energy futures market, Brent, emissions, European natural gas and energy options all posted solid volume gains. Brent crude volume increased 6% over the prior fourth quarter, and as we reported in January's volume release, Brent volume grew 17% compared to the prior January with record open interest. Brent futures and options open interest today stands at approximately 3 million contracts, which is 75% above last January's levels. Continued growth in the Brent futures contract is supported by the development of Brent options and complementary contracts such as refined oil futures.","For the fourth quarter, emissions average daily volume grew 40% to a record 48 million contracts as Phase III of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme approached. In November, ICE began auctions for the U.K. government on our auction platform, which is integrated with our liquid WebICE screen for secondary trading. The middle distillate market remains relatively soft as the Gasoil market remains in backwardation. However, there continues to be strong participation in this market, and Gasoil options volume doubled from the prior fourth quarter. In the North American natural gas market, low volatility and low prices, along with mild weather, significantly curtailed trading activity at the end of 2012 and in January. Our user base remains solidly weighted towards commercial, and the move to futures market has been extremely well received. Finally, we saw volume and revenue growth in almost all of our ag markets. Average daily volume in sugar increased 12% from the prior fourth quarter, and our total ag open interest grew 9% in 2012.","Let's turn now to our credit business on Slide 9. Fourth quarter CDS revenues were $36 million. This includes $17 million from Creditex and $19 million from CDS clearing. Our clearing houses continue to set the industry pace, with more than $37 trillion cleared in gross notional across nearly 400 unique CDS instruments. While the credit execution business remains challenged, we see several catalysts for improvement in CDS markets over the course of 2013. Later this quarter, mandated clearing for U.S. indexes will begin. We also announced regulatory approval for portfolio margining for the buy side where we've now cleared $120 billion of gross notional to date. We filed for the necessary approvals for client clearing in Europe and will expand our product and customer base further in 2013. Finally, we continue to work with the industry on developing the CDS features product and will update you as we progress towards launch.","Let's review our cash generation and returns on investment on Slide 10. For the year, we generated $733 million of operating cash flow and we ended the fourth quarter with $1.6 billion in cash and no net debt. We did a small borrowing to facilitate some intercompany transactions at the end of 2012, which increased debt and cash by an equal amount. This borrowing will be repaid during the first quarter. We used more than $50 million of our strong cash flow during 2012 to repurchase 417,000 shares of ICE stock. And perhaps most importantly, our returns on invested capital remained well above our cost of capital and above the returns of the S&P and our competition. Our cash generation, strong balance sheet and consistent value creation support our ability to continue to invest in growth and innovation to the benefit of our customers and shareholders.","I'll wrap up my remarks on Slide 11. We're proud of our track record of organic growth and successful integration of acquired companies. While 2012 featured another challenging market environment, you can see on this slide that our revenues have consistently risen, our expenses remained well managed and our earnings have continued to grow. And as the chart reflect, this performance clearly distinguishes us among our peers. We do not rest on past accomplishments, though. Rather, we continue to raise the bar on how we define success, and we remain committed to delivering revenue and double-digit earnings growth in 2013. That's what our investors expect from us, and that is the measure of success to which we hold ourselves. And as you saw in 2012, if we come up short of our expectations, it's a self-correcting problem due to our performance-based culture and compensation. Our current business is solid and well positioned to continue to benefit from strong secular trends. We have identified and are executing important strategic initiatives across geographies and asset classes. We are leading market through extraordinary change, and we have a great opportunity in front of us to integrate within NYSE Euronext to create a premier global exchange and a growth company that will be focused on our customers, innovation and value creation. With that, I encourage you to review the guidance in the press release, and I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. Jeff, over to you.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. I'll recap some of the drivers of our 2012 performance and how they position us for the current year and beyond. Then I'll provide an update on our transaction with NYSE Euronext and on our clearing services agreement with NYSE Liffe. As Scott detailed, ICE's seventh consecutive record year came amid a dynamic macro environment. I want to recognize our team at ICE who drove double-digit volume growth while exercising very strong expense discipline.","On Slide 12, you can see that growth in our customer base has continued amid extended economic uncertainty and regulatory change, demonstrating the rising demand for risk management. In 2010, connections to the ICE platform averaged 8,000 per day. In 2012, we averaged 15,000 per day. Our revenues were driven by a balanced mix of U.S. and international customers, as a result of our global commodity products. We've positioned the company at the forefront of global change by responding to shifts in the environment and in our customers' requirements. This responsive culture is consistent with ICE's founding principles that were formed when Chuck Vice, Edwin Marcial and I began mapping out the business many years ago. While ICE has expanded significantly from that time, these objectives remain central. We focus on the needs of end-users in our markets, we promote market transparency and we remain flexible enough to evolve. Scott walked you through the performance of our futures business, and on Slide 13, I'll provide more detail on our global energy markets. Total energy volume grew 13% in 2012 and open interest rose strongly to 70 million contracts. Open interest in Brent futures and options contracts doubled year-on-year to 2.7 million contracts at the end of January 2013. The Brent North Sea crude oil contract continues to drive growth. We're working with the global oil industry to respond to demand for contracts to meet their hedging requirements. The underlying physical production of seaborne Brent crude continues to increase, protecting its longevity of the global oil benchmark. In 2012, Brent became the world's largest crude oil futures contract by contract volume, outtrading WTI by more than 1 billion barrels. Commitment of Traders report confirm that commercial customers have moved towards the Brent benchmark, which causes commodity indices to re-weight in favor of Brent. We continue our strong support for the WTI contract as the leading U.S. crude oil benchmark, and we believe that WTI volume could benefit from growing U.S. production as storage and pipelines adjust to a less import-driven U.S. market. And while WTI futures volumes were down sharply this year across energy exchanges, we believe that if the Brent-WTI spread were to narrow, we would see a return to spread trading that has diminished in recent years as the contracts largely disconnected.","Turning to natural gas. Our volumes in 2002 (sic) [ 2012 ], we recorded a 27% increase in European natural gas futures volume and a 12% increase in U.S. natural gas volume. In recent quarters, U.S. natural gas prices have shown variable volatility and basis relationships have been evolving with the rapidly changing production landscape, causing trading activity in both North American gas and power to be muted. We maintain a close dialogue with our end-users who tell us that the transition of our swaps product to futures contract have allowed them to seamlessly continue risk management in the normal course of business. We do believe that the ongoing uncertainty around the U.S. and EU swaps rule-makings have had overall trading activity limitations and has caused them to some extent to be turned down. That being said, we're very pleased with the reaction from end-users in our energy market who provide consistently positive feedback on our futures transition. Our customers have been willing to take on the increased regulatory requirements of the futures market where possible, rather than face the complex and uncertain remaining issues in the swaps market.","Going into more detail on Slide 14, we continue to introduce new products to meet global demand. In 2012, we added 150 new products that contributed to our $64 million in new product revenue. Product development, supported by ICE Clear Europe has generated meaningful incremental revenue since that clearinghouse's launch just over 4 years ago. And just last week, we announced the slate of 16 new products, including iron ore, Chinese coal and refined oil futures. We continue to drive our Brazilian market initiatives towards -- forward to meet their needs of the developing OTC energy and fixed income markets. And while those revenues won't be material this year, we're very pleased with our progress and our partnerships at both Cetip and BRIX. In Europe, our emissions business grew, with futures and options volume up 23% in 2012. Prices in January have been very low, but emissions volumes actually grew 31% in January versus last year. I also want to mention that despite a challenging CDS market environment, the market remained highly engaged in clearing and planning for its further evolution. We have deep experience in meeting our customers' regulatory requirements, and our framework for financial swap clearing remains unmatched.","We move to Slide 15, I'll provide you an update on our transaction to acquire NYSE Euronext and our clearing services agreement with NYSE Liffe. So starting with the NYSE Liffe clearing agreement, NYSE Liffe chose to utilize ICE Clear Europe as its clearing provider once its clearing delivery timeline, expense and development requirements became evident amid an evolving regulatory environment. Liffe concluded that an outsourced solution would provide the greatest certainty required under the proposed EMIR legislation compliance requirements. Due to the extensive development work, testing and approvals that are needed prior to the transition to ICE Clear, it was important that this work begin right away, which it did in December of 2012. We're also very pleased with the progress and pace of our planning work to acquire NYSE Euronext, and we're eager to begin executing on the growth opportunities that this expanded portfolio brings us. We've outlined on the slide the main areas of focus at this time, including our focus on integration planning and synergy capture, the integration of Liffe's business and portfolio optimization. The move of business on exchange has been amplified by global regulatory reform, and there are many areas of need to provide compliant solutions. As ICE moves into larger addressable asset classes, we'll be able to serve more of our customers' demands for capital efficiency investment and risk management tools, which are driving end-users to reduce operational risk. This will continue to be a long-term growth driver in our industry. ICE's expertise in derivatives will be extended via this transaction into the interest rate space, with opportunities for serving customers across futures and OTC markets. And while both rates and equities appear to be at cyclical lows, there are indications that these markets are poised to grow. Importantly, our customers in the global OTC market are interested in what ICE's solutions for interest rate swaps could look like, based on how we supported their evolution in the energy and credit markets. The range of opportunities available in this transaction is well suited to our strength across clearing, technology, new products and regulatory compliance.","In the United States, NYSE's visibility and brand have again made it the #1 listings venue for IPOs globally despite a very tough equity market. And we believe there's a very solid case for new opportunities in NYSE's U.S. equity business and its many valuable pieces, including its data, listings, options market and its various other initiatives. We'll continue to put a focus on areas where together we can bring more confidence and regulatory parity to markets.","We started a discussion with European stakeholders regarding the potential IPO of the Euronext business, which includes Continental European operations. Our planned approach to these strategic assets would be to make a prudent investment case for new shareholders, provide for a stable and local capital market operator, create a strong independent competitor in the exchange space. Our focus, however, is on completing the steps to close the acquisition. So we'll provide additional information on the potential for a Euronext IPO as those plans are developed. And finally in terms of process, last week we filed our first draft of our registration statement with the SEC. And on January 16, we completed our Hart-Scott-Rodino filing in the U.S. The EU and the U.K. approval process is very extensive, but we're working to streamline these approvals through a dialogue with regulators. And as the approval process continues, we'll keep you apprized of developments. I hope that you can see, however, that we remain very enthusiastic about this transaction and our future as a growth leader in the global marketplace.","We turn to Slide 16, I'll highlight key themes for ICE in 2013. While economic and regulatory uncertainties remain, these are often drivers of growth at ICE. Companies rely on our markets to hedge risk where uncertainty exist, and we're expanding the ways in which we can serve the needs of our customers around the world. We have consistently delivered growth on top of growth, and we believe that this will continue to be the case by developing customer-centric solutions that support our users. The strong secular trends we've seen in commodities have not abated, and our customer growth continues as we expand our product set. We believe that financial reform implementation will bring confidence back to the derivatives market, and together with cyclical improvements in credit markets and the move to exchange trading and clearing, a healthy volume environment can be supported over the long term. With our strong core business, new growth initiatives and our NYSE Euronext transaction, we believe that we're best positioned to capitalize on change and to continue to lead. We had a very solid 2012 with 9% EPS growth, adjusted operating margin expansion and 18% returns on invested capital. ICE's growth drivers and our growth targets remain differentiated.","So on behalf of everyone at ICE, I'd like to thank our customers for their business in 2012. And I'd also like to thank the buy side and the sell side professionals who recognized Scott Hill, Kelly Loeffler and the ICE Investor Relations team and me in the 2012 Institutional Investors Survey. And thank you to my colleagues at ICE for delivering the best year in our company's history. I have every confidence that 2013 will be another record year for us. I'll now ask Bethany, our operator, to conduct the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I guess -- and congrats on a strong quarter, but since we're limited on questions, I'm going to focus on the transaction with the NYSE. Jeff you mentioned in your prepared remarks and you'd mentioned in the media about strength in the equity market structure. I think you mentioned something about parity in your prepared remarks. How much time you'll spend looking at, and what are some of the -- can you give us some hints on how you would try to improve the NYSE's position, I guess, in the U.S. equity market structure?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Sure. Well, first of all, NYSE graciously allowed us to do diligence on their business as we were negotiating the transaction, and we were pleasantly surprised by many of the things we saw inside their U.S. equity franchise, particularly the strong listings business that I mentioned to you and the fact that they have a very robust data and data dissemination business that they're strengthening right now. So there's very good components in there. Also, we maintained a strong interest in the options business in our core commodity franchise, and we're looking to help expand that through acquisition of NYSE's equity options businesses. But I think when I talk about changes to market structure, it's very clear that there's already an existing dialogue going on, NYSE has been a very strong part of that dialogue. And I'm hoping that attention that will be paid to ICE and to NYSE as a part of this transaction will increase the pulpit that both we and the New York Stock Exchange have to make comments about how the market structure can be improved. And so to a certain degree, we're taking advantage of the attention that you all are giving us to point out problems and try to be creative with our will-be solutions. I generally think the pendulum has swung too far in some of the reforms that were put in place in the market and that the market itself needs to come up with solutions that it can take back to market participants and to regulators in a collaborative way. And I know just from our short time having announced this deal 5 weeks ago, that a lot of people in those industries have reached out to me and my colleagues at ICE with ideas on how things can be improved. So I'm relatively optimistic that the pendulum has swung far enough and is going to come back to a more rational environment.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. I thought you might say some about rebates because I know you haven't been fond of the rebate structure there but...","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","All right, I'll say something about rebates. I've just read where another exchange has offered up a rebate structure where it has a negative capture rate for the company. I learned a long time ago, if you want to stand out on a corner and hand out $5 bills, you will attract a line of people. I do not understand why anyone would take their shareholder value or take -- to benefit one class of customer, and in this case, target it at one specific company to move their business and treat that particular company and its customers differently than all other people in the marketplace. And I hope that kind of behavior will stop in that industry. It's disruptive. It's not good for shareholders, it's not long-term good for investors. And where we see those kinds of things, I'll be vocal about them because I do come in as an outsider, and hopefully, can have some credibility along with my colleagues to point out things that patently seem absurd.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I'm glad I dragged that out of you. I'll consider that my follow-up.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Howard Chen with Credit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Jeff, a question on your core energy and commodities trading business. When we look back at the underlying user growth expansion in 2012, it looks like you saw a flattening of total user growth in the first half and then a sharp acceleration in the back half. So I was wondering if you could provide maybe a bit more detail and color on where you attribute that flattening and then that re-acceleration too, and what does that all tell you as you set up into 2013 and beyond?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Sure. I think a couple of things are going on. One, in our Brent market, which is our flagship energy product, commercial users have long known about Brent. And in fact, when we brought the International Petroleum Exchange of London, it was a commercial exchange for all intents and purposes. There were almost no noncommercial participants in that exchange other than the floor community. And what you've seen now is a bit, I think, of a lagging response, where indices and other people that look at volume trends in rebalancing their indexes and portfolio managers that look at how to approach commodities look backward to rebalance and saw the performance of our Brent markets in 2011 and then took the beginning of 2012 to think about how to readjust their portfolio and then found us in the back half of the year. The second trend that's going on, which is quite an interesting trend, is that the U.S. energy markets are fundamentally changing as we speak, and the country is becoming more natural gas-oriented and that natural gas is coming, because it was associated initially with frac-ing, you got gas coming in areas that were oil-oriented. And so you have a different basis relationship between the gas markets. And that was not well understood in the beginning of 2012, but as we move through the year, more and more people are starting to think about their exposure to natural gas. And we see increasingly a lot of mix change going on in the gas business. And the last trend that hit us in the back half of the year was we announced that we were moving from swaps to futures. When you -- the difference in those markets are profound. A lot of people tend to underestimate the regulatory differences of being fully regulated futures. But our OTC markets were principals only. In other words, there were no brokers. In regulated futures, we can have regulated futures brokers who can act on behalf of their customers. So we opened up that. Secondly, when we were OTC, you had to have a high capital requirements to participate,  in regulated futures retail investors can participate. So we broadened our addressable market. And I think those 3 trends are what played out in the back half of the year.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. Thanks for wrapping that all together. And my follow-up, as we get closer to these mandatory and clearing deadlines, I was hoping you could speak to some of the trends you're seeing in CDS clearing post-portfolio margin approval. And then just a broad question, how active are you able to be on the interest rate swap clearing conversation, given all that you have going on at the company?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Yes, so just with regard to the CDS part of it, Howard, we are seeing the interest in activity around the CDS clearing significantly increase as you might expect over the last kind of 2 to 3 months, particularly with the approval that we got on the portfolio margining, which was the key element of the buy side offering. We had it for the sell side, we needed it for the buy side. So once we had that locked down, the conversations have accelerated, and it's our full expectation that as we get to the mandatory clearing later this quarter and certainly throughout the rest of the year, that you'll see a quick acceleration in the buy side's clearing. And with portfolio margining, it's our expectation that it will go beyond just the mandated index because as you know what the portfolio margining does, it allows people to move in their index and single names and get the efficient capital treatment that they've desired. So we're quite hopeful, and that hope is based on customer conversation that as we get into March and throughout the rest of the year, we will begin to see a significant ramp on the buy side clearing.","Scott A. Hill","And on interest rates, a couple of things going on. First of all, because we don't have regulatory approvals, we're not actively engaged with NYSE in a joint dialogue because we would have fund jumping issues, but ICE is and long has been looking at and working behind the scenes on the interest rate space. We have a lot of domain knowledge in our company about that space that we've acquired over time and so we have independently been working on initiatives here that will allow us, we hope, to move relatively quickly once the acquisition is completed.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I would actually love to follow up on Howard's question. So the 2 things, the change in basis for nat gas and the migration from OTC to listed, you said or maybe implied that it depressed volumes and probably was further hurt by the low volatility. But as the market gets used to these changes, the volumes kind of -- or participation, just kind of recover back to where they were? Or does these kind of changes set up for greater participation in the future and therefore, greater activity levels at any given level of volatility. I'm just trying to understand what the implications are longer-term. Is it just a recovery or is there actual paradigm shift leading to further growth? Does that make sense?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Yes, absolutely. I think there is a paradigm shift. I think the United States is going to become a gas -- a natural gas-oriented energy economy. And while prices will be low, because we have an abundance of gas, on a percentage basis, a $0.10 or $0.20 move is a large move. And as people become more dependent on natural gas, they will want to hedge out their risks. What we see going on right now is, as mentioned, natural gas used to -- in this country, used to be largely a south to north movement, and now it's an east to west movement. And so the relationships that people had on how they hedge their risk versus the benchmark contract that we offer are changing and some of those relationships are unknown because of the logistical challenges of moving this gas around are great. And in talking to some very senior people in the industry, they're starting to get a handle on how the markets will work in times of low volatility and high volatility, and as I think they become more adept at that, you'll see the larger dealers more proactively offering to hedge their customers' business because they can understand the risk. So I'm long term bullish on it and I think, in other words, you want to be in the U.S. natural gas business as the U.S. is becoming a natural gas economy. And if you look at the numbers, Ken, in September, October, we were seeing a decent reacceleration in nat gas and people kind of took November and December off. But January got us right back around those same levels. So even in the near term, we did see some tick-up in the fall and in January, it's an encouraging start. Down against a really difficult compare, but an encouraging start relative to the last half year.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Awesome. Okay. Thank you. And then on emissions, I'd love to hear outlook, you had some stuff in the prepared remarks, we're in Phase III, volumes zoomed in 4Q, prices are really low. So what are the political and regulatory themes that drive activity maybe in '13. And then pricing has dropped so much, it feels like it's going to cost as much to trade one of these contracts as the cost of the contract itself. So does pricing need to change here given the decline in the value of the contract itself?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Those are good questions. First of all, there's a lot of uncertainty around the political response to the low prices, as you're aware, I believe. And we are participating actively in that dialogue. Prices fell because in Phase III, we moved to a price-based auction process to -- for new contracts, and we ran those auctions in the U.K. So far, our auctions have been successful and have cleared the market. There was a failure in auctions run on the European continent by others. But we continue to see robust trading. The one thing I can say, Ken, having spent time over there and really worked in these markets with our colleagues, is there is a true commitment to reduce carbon in Europe, and there is a commitment to doing that in the most free-market, rate-based way possible. And so I think the politicians and the regulators over there will come to some rational conclusions. They are working quickly to shore up the program because they want it to continue to succeed. And so all that bodes well for us. Very hard to predict volumes as we go through an uncertain regulatory condition. We've seen that in other markets, obviously, in the past few years, regulatory uncertainty. But it does appear that in Europe, that people involved want to get this quickly nailed down, which is a good thing.","Scott A. Hill","And then again, just looking at the numbers, Ken, I mean the fourth quarter emissions volumes were up off the third quarter, which is unique among a number of our products. So even with all the dynamics that you suggested, it increased 2Q to 3Q, then increased Q3 to Q4. So the interest in trading those products on our exchange remains high.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Allen with Evercore.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Scott, I just wanted to talk a little bit on the expense guidance. You inferred flexibility on the compensation side. Just looking at the guidance range, should we -- I mean, should we be thinking about that the level that would be -- I mean, a good level to think about to produce double-digit earnings growth if we see a scenario next year where it's more flattish revenue growth you'd see a pull back as we saw this year. I guess, I'm trying to drive at like how conservative is your guidance estimate looking forward in the expense side?","Scott A. Hill","Look, as I said in my prepared remarks, our compensation is tied to our performance. Our expectation this year is we'll grow double-digit earnings. You can figure out from that, in my expense guidance, that suggests that we think we're going to have a solid revenue growth year. If that's come -- if we don't make that objective, just like you saw in 2012, the compensation self corrects. It's the model we've got. I mean, just to give you an example, we get performance-based restricted shares, and the number of shares people get are completely tied to the performance of our company. And those shares go down to the manager level of our company. So that tells you that a large number of people in our company get those shares, that even if we were very close on our objectives, we came under, or we came out just short, and yet there was a 25% haircut on the number of RSUs that was granted. So when we say we've got a performance-based culture, our compensation plans back it up. And it's a meaningful impact if we don't get to the objectives we set.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Great. Thanks, guys. And then just -- I just want to ask a little bit on the data service fees line, continued stable to upward progression there. Yesterday, it seems you talked about lower screen count and then a pull back in terms of co-location demand implying less user demand overall. Just wondering if you've seen any impact given announced pricing change that's kicking in first quarter 2013? Based on this chart on Slide 12, it seems like you've seen continued growth in your user side. So any color on that front will be helpful as well.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Let me take part of it at the higher level. We have a co-location regime, but we've never really looked at that as a driver of revenue. The reason is that, over time, computers generally get smaller. And over time, the power consumption of a computer goes down. Over time, the cooling consumption goes down to the extent you're selling real estate power or cooling, you're in a market where the footprint is going down. And so that particular part of trading is not something that have we focused necessarily as a revenue opportunity. We provide co-location services and all the things I just mentioned to help facilitate people who want to trade, but not necessarily is a different line. On our data business, we have a history of entering new markets and when we enter new markets, almost de facto, the data that we have is scant and poor. And as we penetrate markets, our data becomes richer and we have a history of giving away data or making things free initially and as they become more certain, then we bring them up to our normal rates of charging, and I think you can see that in the case of how we penetrated certain new markets now and have such a rich data set that people are willing to pay for it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just wanted to come back to the deal for a second. It sounds like -- obviously 1.5 months ago you announced this deal, seems to be a lot of focus on ICE Clear, given the relationship there. But wondering how much of an opportunity the management team or you personally, has had to meet with more people at NYX and I know that the deal is public, get to know the businesses a little bit more. I know you can't really get the ground -- hit the ground running yet, but to what degree has your thoughts about synergies or rationalization of certain businesses changed since maybe 1.5 months ago?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well it's a good question. First of all.  Duncan Niederauer and his management team have been fabulous and completely engaged with us. Daily conversations going on for planning, integration planning, and also continue to help -- helping ICE just understand their businesses. They have a 200-year-old company that has many, many more complexities than our 12-year-old company. And so we continue to learn about it and discuss ways of improving and working -- proving they're in our business as we combine. We look at the synergy buckets really pretty basically, which is one bucket of synergies on how ICE can integrate Liffe and move into the interest-rate business, which are all cost-based, no revenue synergies there. One bucket on how we can put together our corporate cultures and technology. And one bucket that really NYSE has already previously identified as their Project 14, which we wanted to validate and also take credit for it as we would continue the work that they've started post-merger. We've not looked at or talked about synergies with the potential spin-off of Euronext. There are other parts of their businesses in -- that they continue to move forward on various initiatives that we will inherit and we'll have better opportunity months from now to see what those look like. They have -- as they mentioned to you, I think, on their call yesterday, a number of initiatives where there are positive momentum and noises around them, and so we have the advantage of waiting to see how those play out and then we can make more important decisions on what those look like in a combined company. So in that regard, we have our antenna up and the dialogue is very deep and robust, but we have not announced any new synergies.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then maybe just for Scott. Just to come back to Chris Allen's question here on the guidance, I think the guidance range is something like $10 million in total and I was a little surprised to see the D&A range of $5 million here. So can you talk about the comp obviously being a big variable, but it looks like there's some variability here. And it looks, to me, I would say this is something where you should have some sort of visibility. So maybe you can just explain why you have such a big range there and what the moving pieces are?","Scott A. Hill","Yes, so if I understand the question correctly, on $0.5 billion of expense, why we have a $10 million range. I think that's fairly tight and we've been pretty good about giving you expense guidance. At 3% to 5% expense growth and double-digit earnings growth, you will see a return on the comp line to 100% budgets or bonus assumption, and that costs me about $6 million out of loans 1 point of the growth, if we take that out, it's 2% to 4%. The D&A we told you we'd spend about $60 million to $70 million in capital, ultimately that's going to flow back to the D&A line. There's some growth there. We spent about $60 million or so in non-real estate capital in 2012. So as I kind of step back and look at it, if go down line by line, SG&A is going to be about in line from where it was last year, D&A is going to be only slightly up from where it was last year, professional services is going to be about in line with where it was last year and you're going to see a bit of an increase in comps. And again, frankly, that's getting us back to 100% achievement of our double-digit target. It's hiring a very modest number of people and it's supporting growth again on top of growth. So I think it's a pretty tight range for a company pretty focused on growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Roger Freeman with Barclays.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Jeff, you want to come back to a point you touched on interest rate swaps in that you've been kind of doing work in the background. One of the things I wonder about is the timing of the deal closing and the sort of inability to directly work with NYSE in the process. But the market is going to be pretty much switched over to swap clearing by third quarter, which is about  when the deal may close. So you said relatively quickly you need to come to market. I mean, it feels like it also has to happen within a short number of months. I mean is that a fair way to think about that?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, if I had a magic wand I'd close the deal tomorrow and so we can all proceed and get working. But I think what you're referring to is largely U.S. timetable. Europe is slightly behind that, and as you may have seen, the EMIR legislation just suffered another timing setback in the last couple of days. And if you look at the NYSE interest rate footprint, it's largely European-based. So I think we certainly have more time there. But longer-term, I'm really convinced that clearinghouses that can manage customer capital in a way that people feel confident about and do it transparently and with a close relationship with the treasury functions are going to attract business. And I really think we can differentiate our capabilities. We have the benefit, frankly, of building a new clearinghouse and looking at best practices across all existing clearinghouses when we did that, and we have the benefit of building technology in the Internet age that can be lightweight and easily connectable. And underneath, we have been hiring a lot of quantitative people and treasury-type people, which is really the hiring that Scott just referred to, to build out our capabilities that I think ultimately over time, we will be able to attract business and thereby, build growth across asset classes. And that's the basic investment thesis that we're making in this transaction.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Good. And a fair point on the European time line. And I guess the other question is going back to CDS and kind of the outlook there. One of the issues I think on kind of broader adoption is the challenges in clearing financial CDS. I just want to see if there's an update on whether that's been worked out. And then also on the sovereign CDS, I was wondering if you have any thought on why the SEC has taken so long to approve. I would have thought Europe would have been a tougher regulatory body to get through.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","That one was a tough regulatory body to get through. I'm kind of like, yes, I'd like his magic wand to wave it through. But at the end of the day, I think all the regulators are wanting to be more cautious and to better understand the risks [indiscernible]. With western European stocks, just as an example, those are European names, clearing European clearinghouse and regulatory approval we need is from the U.S. regulator, the SEC. But they have oversight, amongst many other regulators of ICE clearinghouse, and they want to make sure they understand the business that's going through there. So I think it's just people being prudent and cautious. It's frustrating for us because we're very confident in the solution we've got. The FSA signed off on it. We're already clearing [indiscernible] in ICE Clear Credit. So I wish I could give you a better reason as to why but I think it's just an abundance of caution that's coming across regulators today, wanting to make sure every T is crossed a couple of times. So we're continuing to work through because there is demand for those products and we are ready to clear them. So we'll just -- we'll continue to work closely with the SEC and try and get it over the hurdle. With regards to the financials and other products, I would tell you we will continue to develop more products as we move forward, working through options and tranches and a number of new products to make available for clearing. The financial CDS has some unique risks in that some of those financials aren't clearing members. And so those  probably aren't up at the front of the line in terms of product development but there's still opportunity for further product development to be had and to get revenue growth from that. And then as i mentioned in our prepared remarks, an area where we are focused is we now have a license for market and an opportunity to develop a CDS future and we're working very closely with the industry. The early reaction has been positive and as I mentioned in my remarks, we'll give you guys an update as we move forward and get closer to a launch, but that's a product where we are spending a lot of time right now and where we think there is a good opportunity for it inside 2013.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Niamh Alexander with KBW.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And yes, I'm going to follow up on the credit derivatives because you gave us a really neat update last quarter and you made some huge progress in getting the license and incredibly getting the dealers to move on screen and we since heard about the client dealer venue on screen, which really bodes well. I guess in the meantime you've been busy raising your prices for NYX. But can you tell -- give -- what can you share with us about the credit, the next feature product, is it this quarter, is it next quarter? And have you gotten kind of commitment and incentives for dealers yet? Maybe you can share a little bit on how to think about the economics?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Sure. Well, first of all, we've gone out to the market and asked the question and the question that you see in the press, do you want to just take the existing swaps-tied contract and futurize it? Or should we take the opportunity to develop a contract that is a little more conducive to the way people may handle risk? Or do you do both or some combination? And how big should this contract be and what should the tick size be and who are the natural users of the contract and that kind of thing. So we're doing our homework because we think that there will be ultimately a large suite of credit products that can be traded on exchange, but we would like our initial entry into that -- we'd like opening night to be a hit so that we can lever off of that. And so that's just taking a lot of conversation. As Scott mentioned, the conversations have been good. People are interested. The OTC credit default swap market in single names has been very challenged, frankly, since the Lehman collapse. It's been on a downward trajectory and there are a lot of people that want to manage credit risk that would like to have the tools to do that. And so we see people helping us in trying new things. As you alluded to, we now have companies that are streaming prices in the OTC market and we have been engaged with those companies about the types of futures products that we could potentially offer and how they could modify those streaming algorithms to help us frame the markets and give us prices on the first day. And those conversations are going well. So it's a very different environment today, I think, than just a few years ago, where there is a real appetite in our minds to create a headline product and a lot of good dialogue. Frankly, there's no negativity, the dialogue is all around the nuances of what would be the best product and how should it relate to existing risks that's out there. So we're cautiously optimistic. It could be a very good opportunity for us. And I think you know I personally stuck my neck out that I think credit is an undertraded asset class and it wants to be standardized and listed. And I think if we do it right, it will do well. And we've seen a huge uptake in trading of cash credit in the form of bonds, and I think that the market would prefer to trade risk in a more standardized derivative and concentrate that risk on an exchange. And so that's what we've been working out for the last few years. And I do think it's a 2013 opportunity and I do think it's something that we will be launching at the end of the first quarter or early in the second quarter, depending upon the readiness of the market.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Thanks so much, Jeff. I appreciate you expounding on that. And then secondarily, back to the energy product and I guess we talked about everything but the dynamics of the pricing in gas markets and how maybe that's shifting the volume demand and then some of the characteristics there. But coming at it from the customer perspective, you've got this morning's Journal article about how some of the large pension funds are reconsidering the strategy of investing in options indices, or just in commodities indices, shall we say, and if there's one consultant telling one pension fund, oftentimes a lot of consultant is telling others to do something similar and engage in some of the strategy. Is that something that you've seen yet or you've been able to identify maybe some of those customers pulling back a little bit?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Yes, I think what -- another what we see is conversations with our salespeople about how less correlated commodities are to equities. And that phenomenon bodes well for institutional investments that are looking for diversity. As I think you're probably uniquely aware of, after the Lehman collapse, everything seemed to be correlated, and everything seemed to be correlated to government action, and to a certain degree. And now it does feel like we're going back to a disconnect where fixed income and equities and commodities will have their own unique trading behavior going forward. And I think that bodes well for commodities. And bodes well particularly for Brent, particularly as those indexes have started to add heavier weights of Brent, which has contributed to our growth and will continue to do so.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Well, it's kind of opposite to what, I guess, they're saying that some of these pension funds are pulling back from index investing in commodities.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, I think right now, it looks like everybody's rushing into equities. And then we appreciate all of those -- all of you listening that have done that in ICE stock.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So my question would be, in Europe, with the financial transaction tax that they keep talking about, I mean, seems like they have a group of 11 or 12 countries are interested. How much of that concern you about negatively impacting the long term value of the NYSE Euronext franchise?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, first of all, taxing a product that you sell is probably never a healthy thing, but the way I look at it, frankly, is that the marginal user what will no longer manage risk or make an investment because of the transaction cost is probably a de-sensitive customer. And that, in our world, is probably an algorithmic trader, who has the least net income contribution to the company. So I think while on a volume basis, you hear people talking about large downturns, I'm not sure on an economic basis, it's as draconian. We have seen in our markets -- we've always, at ICE, I think, has been a little bit of a lagger when it comes to bringing algorithmic trading into our markets. We want it and it's a part of our industry right now, but we want it to be constructive and provide liquidity. And we have seen that in markets where we don't have algorithmic traders, we can provide liquidity with people with a mouse who are actually willing to pay us more for the opportunity to capture the bid offer spread. So I'm not sure it's as negative as maybe the press would make it to be with respect to NYSE. And frankly, anything that can help prevent the fragmentation that goes on in the equities markets is probably a good thing in the long run and that tax, in an odd way, may actually contribute to less fragmentation.","Scott A. Hill","Yes, and Patrick, you've got to remember, it's 11 out of 27, and 3 of those 11 announced plans already that are completely different. And now all 11 of them have to agree on exactly the same plan for it to come into effect. So you can imagine, just getting to a point where you have an agreed tax is likely to take quite some time,  if ever. And then once that happens, it's just as Jeff said.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","The U.K. has a stamp duty tax on shares that trade there. The difference, in my understanding, is the difference in the transaction tax being discussed now is the revenues would go to Brussels, the E.U., whereas the stamp duty tax in the U.K., the revenues are going to the U.K. government. But it doesn't look like the London Stock Exchange has necessarily suffered that much to me. It's actually been doing quite well under Xavier's leadership.","Operator","Our final question will come from Brian Bedell from ISI Group.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Jeff or Scott, can you give us a sense of the revenue impact from the Liffe clearing arrangement beginning in the third quarter? Obviously, it makes a lot of sense given your platform is already built. So from the expense side, it's not any kind of significant increase. But just to get a sense of the maybe annualized revenue, obviously, it depends on volumes and maybe if you could base it on, say, either January Liffe volumes for example?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Yes, we haven't really given guidance on that. It's out in the back half of the year and we haven't provided those terms of the contract. So I really -- I don't want to provide a number to you here. What I will tell you is that it was a heavily negotiated deal. It is a good commercial arrangement from Liffe's standpoint. As you said, we benefit because it leverages most of our existing infrastructure, so we're able to do it at a far smaller investment than would have been the case otherwise. And we've got a track record of having done this. We did lead LTH [ph]. We did transition a big amount of OI over. So it's a good deal for both sides that gives Liffe the certainty they needed. It gives us the opportunity to drive some more volume to a fixed infrastructure. But in terms of specific guidance, I'd ask your patience a bit as we get further into the buildout for us to give any specific numbers.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","That's fair enough. And then just maybe a follow-up question on the long term use of excess capital that you'll be generating from the very strong free cash flow from the deal you look out into 2014 and 2015. Can you just give us a sense of what your priorities would be for deployment of that excess capital and including the potential capital from the IPO of Euronext?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Yes, that's a great question. And I think what we would expect to do in the future will be largely guided by what you've seen us do in the past with one exception. As we've noted post-close of the deal, we will begin to pay a dividend, a dollar amount about the same as you see today of $300 million. So that will be one use of capital that you haven't seen us do historically. Beyond that, there are really going to be 3 focuses, and I'll give them to you in order. We are going to continue to be a growth company and we will look for opportunities to invest in further growth, whether that's internal CapEx, internal software development, M&A opportunities, et cetera, we will continue to focus on that. In the immediate term right after the deal, we will focus on deleveraging. And depending on when the deal closes, we'll likely be around 2.5x levered on a combined basis. As you know, historically, we've been closer and a little below 1x, and we will quickly work our way towards that number. I would expect, within a year, we'll you get down below 2 and quickly into the 1x to 1.5x range with objective to get to 1x over time. And then in addition to that, just as we did on admittedly a smaller scale with the Creditex deal, there is going to be a number of shares that will put dilution into the market and we'll use cash flow to buy those shares back opportunistically to reduce that dilution impact. So again, it's a combination of what you've seen in the past. There's going to be growth, there's going to be de-leveraging, there's going to be share buybacks. But then post-close, for the first time in the company's history, we will begin to pay a dividend.","Operator","That does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn it back to management for any closing statement.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Thank you, Bethany. And thank you, all, for joining us this morning. We'll keep you informed as we proceed with the NYSE Euronext acquisition and also with the progress of the many other initiatives that we have underway. And I'd like to wish you all a Happy New Year of snake.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Kelly Loeffler, please go ahead.","Kelly Loeffler","Good morning. ICE's third quarter 2015 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of theice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay.","Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements which we undertake no obligation to update represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements please refer to our 2014 Form 10-K.","In our earnings supplement we refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including adjusted income, operating margin, expenses, EPS, EBITDA and tax rate. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP terms in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful as well as how management uses these measures. When used on this call net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses, adjusted net income refers to adjusted net income from continuing operations, and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted continuing operations earnings per share.","With us on the call are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Chuck Vice, President and Chief Operating Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Hill","Thank you, Kelly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will begin on Slide 4 with some highlights of our strong performance through the first nine months of 2015. Our overall revenues grew 7% versus the prior year. Transaction revenues were up thanks to strength in our commodities markets as well as in our U.S. cash equities market. Our data services revenue grew 22% and listings revenues grew 11%. In addition to solid top line growth, adjusted operating expenses declined 5% from the prior year, which enabled adjusted operating margins to expand 5 points to 59%. All of this combined to generate 26% year-over-year growth in our adjusted earnings per share and we generated $890 million in operating cash flow in the first nine months of this year enabling us to return nearly $850 million to shareholders, while continuing to invest in our business.","Please turn to Slide 5, where I will discuss our third-quarter performance. Our adjusted earnings per share rose 24% from the prior third quarter to $2.91. Net revenues grew 10% year-over-year to $816 million. This was driven by record quarterly data services and listings revenue and solid growth across commodities and U.S. cash equities. While revenues grew, adjusted operating expenses declined 2% year-to-year to $337 million and margins expanded 5 points to 59%. Operating expenses were slightly above our guidance due to a true-up in our bonus accrual for the full-year reflecting our expectation that we will exceed our challenging 2015 financial objectives with notable strength in our commodities and in particular our data services business.","Our pay-for-performance culture rewards our team and our results exceed the appropriately high expectations of ICE investors. Importantly though, well over 85% of that overachievement dropped straight to our bottom line. Our strong third-quarter results cemented our path to record results for the full-year.","Moving now to Slide 6, I will highlight our third-quarter net revenues of $816 million, which were up 10% year-to-year. Transaction revenues accounted for 56% of our total revenues and increased 3% year-to-year. Our transaction revenues are diversified across nine asset classes, which benefit from both secular and cyclical trends and include our energy revenues that grew 5% during the quarter. The remaining 44% of total net revenues were subscription or what we previously referred to as non-transaction revenues. Those revenues increased 20% over the prior third-quarter. Our subscription revenues encompass our data services offerings, including proprietary data, connectivity and valuation and benchmark products from SuperDerivatives and ICE Benchmark Administration. These revenues also include our listings business, which continues to lead in helping our customers raise the capital they need to grow their businesses.","I'll provide some additional detail on revenues on Slide 7. Within transaction revenues, commodities revenues grew 5% year-to-year due to strength across our energy and Ag markets supported by ongoing price volatility. In addition U.S. cash equities revenues were up double-digits year-to-year. Though financial revenues declined, we continue to expand our product offering and are well-positioned when the European economy begins to improve. As you can also see we generated record data services revenue of $209 million in the third quarter, which was up 24% year-to-year as we continue to attract new users and offer new services such as those provided by SuperDerivatives and ICE Benchmark Administration. And finally you will note that listings revenues of $101 million increased 10% year-to-year and remained at record levels, which is a testament to the strength of the NYSE market model and our unrelenting focus on remaining the leading capital raising platform for companies around the world.","Next on Slide 8, I will discuss our third quarter adjusted operating expenses. Expenses during the quarter declined 2% to $337 million. Adjusted operating margins expanded 5 points to 59%. The 4% increase in compensation and benefit is the result of the higher bonus accrual we made during the quarter to reflect the outstanding results we believe we will deliver for the full-year 2015. Professional services expenses as well as SG&A and rent expenses declined double-digit year-to-year as we continue to integrate the NYSE. And finally, strategic investments in our business caused technology and D&A expenses to increase modestly compared to last year's third quarter.","I will conclude my third quarter remarks on Slide 9 with a review of our solid cash generation and capital returns. At September 30th, we had $708 million in unrestricted cash and short-term investments and an adjusted debt to EBITDA of 1.6 times. During the first nine months of 2015 we generated $890 million of operating cash which enabled us to invest in growth and to return nearly $850 million to our shareholders through dividends and buy backs. And by the end of this year even though we've now suspended our share repurchase program pending the close of the Interactive Data deal, including the share repurchases completed in October and the dividend that we will pay during the fourth quarter, we will return nearly $1 billion to shareholders during 2015. We are on track for a record year in 2015, including solid revenue growth, operating margin expansion, double-digit earnings growth and significant capital returns to our shareholders.","I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Sprecher","Thank you, Scott and good morning. Today I am pleased to report on one of the best quarters in our company's history and to share the strategic vision for the continued evolution of our company. Before I discuss ICE's expanded data services opportunity, I want to first highlight our diverse range of growth opportunities. I'm often asked how we plan to grow revenues over the long term. So I will begin with a few of these drivers on Slide 10.","These are just a few of the areas that give us confidence in our ongoing double-digit earnings growth. Many of the areas listed on this slide; energy, listings, data, and U.S. equities contributed to our 10% revenue growth and our 24% earnings growth during the third quarter. I'm pleased to note that on November 17th, our initiative to serve the growing demand for trading, clearing and risk management in Asia will launch as ICE Futures Singapore and ICE Clear Singapore. Our initial products include Mini Brent and gasoil futures, gold and Mini RMB futures and we expect to expand the range of tools we offer based on the needs of our customers as market participants demand more risk management services in the Asian region.","Moving on to Slide 11, I will turn to our unique growth opportunity in data services. Today our data business includes a growing number of subscription services ranging from trading and settlement data to data delivery to Analytics. Trading and settlement data comes directly from our exchanges and clearing houses including real-time, view-only, historical and customized data. Our data delivery services help our customers connect or receive our data using co-location or as well as our secure conductivity known as the Safety Network. And the Analytics tools that we have acquired and developed that make raw data more meaningful, such as index price creation, benchmarks, valuations and forward pricing curves for the commodities and financial markets.","This area includes products from SuperDerivatives and will include products from Interactive Data Corporation following the closing of our transaction in the coming months. What we see is more customers using data to inform their trading decisions and increasingly their capital allocation decisions. So we are focused on harnessing our data in the more usable value-added information that our customers can easily consume to make more educated risk management decisions and comply with regulatory requirements.","Next on Slide 12 I would like to offer some additional insight into our recently announced Interactive Data Corporation transaction. Interactive Data is a leading provider of financial market data, analytics and related distribution solutions. It serves virtually all of the world's major financial institutions and asset managers. The majority of Interactive Data's revenue approximately 70% comes from providing evaluated pricing of hard to value, thinly traded, fixed income securities. The other 30% is derived from widely distributed data and technology platforms. What we see is the opportunity to leverage this valuable asset to innovate for our customers while creating tremendous value for shareholders.","ICE is a consistent earnings-per-share growth company that has recognized industry trends early and placed ourselves at their intersection in order to innovate around change. Recall that in 2007 we acquired the New York Board of Trade in order to gain access to clearing technology, believing that we could make clearing a strategic business rather than a back-office function. We took this newly acquired clearing technology and launched one of the world's most important commodity clearing houses in London. We then built on this technology to take $65 trillion of credit derivatives off the books of the world's largest financial institutions. As part of the NYSE Euronext transaction we expanded this technology to include the interest rate and equity derivatives markets and most recently we've adapted this platform to serve the Asian markets.","This robust, sophisticated technology calculates the value of millions of clear trading positions around the world every day. NYSE Euronext also brought us an equity value calculator that is relied upon the value our 95% market share of ETF listings. We acquired SuperDerivatives last year for its ability to value complex instruments and trading positions particularly in the foreign exchange space. We built ICE Benchmark Administration and now calculate the LIBOR rates, the value of interest rate swaps known as the ICE Swap Rate, the London Gold Price. And in October we will calculate the same valuation parameters for the initial margining of bilateral swaps. So all of this breezes to Monday when ICE announced its agreement to acquire Interactive Data, the foremost valuation provider in the global fixed income market.","Energy, agriculture, credit, interest rate futures, interest rate swaps, LIBOR, equities, equity derivatives, exchange traded funds, foreign exchange, gold and now fixed income instruments; ICE is becoming one of the world's foremost providers of tools and information that's needed to value risk whether that's found on-exchange off-exchange or in the cash markets. So what is this trend that we are targeting? It's the increasing need for more information to optimize capital efficiency when you manage risk. And as bank balance sheets have become constrained and as regulation requires collateral for all risk positions we believe that there will be increasing demand for the data, information and solutions after the cost of holding, hedging and managing risk. And we have demonstrated our willingness to invest, to be a trusted source in this important area.","When we started working on ICE in the late 1990s, exchanges were largely regional businesses. In fact, they recognized this and actually had the location in their name. The New York Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Metal Exchange, the Deutsche Borse, the Hong Kong Exchange, so you get my drift here. The move to electronic trading and to the Internet transformed many of these regional businesses into global business improving their market access. And as they lost their borders, exchanges became more competitive with one another, listing each other's products and beginning to fragment market liquidity.","Additionally some players started the lobby government to adopt rules to even further fragment liquidity, in order to benefit broker intermediaries, high-frequency traders as well as exchanges that are seeking regulatory solutions to their commercial challenges. So this resulted in regulation [NMAP] in the United States and MiFID and MiFID II in Europe. Market fragmentation means that not all buyers will find their lowest cost sellers and vice versa. So this fosters informational asymmetries where certain market participants and intermediaries will benefit from arbitrage opportunities. And since many buyers and sellers can't or won't make the technology investment required to find the best price in a more complex market, they compensate brokers and intermediaries that have made the investments in the technology and the data to do so.","So as markets fragment the value of data increases and the matching of buyers and sellers on exchanges decreases on a relative basis, with some execution venues actually paying users to match orders. Why would they do that, because as exchanges unbundle their execution services they can address the widening bid offer spreads that fragmentation brings by providing market access and market data. So what you see in our business is now a directional shift of the mix from transaction-based revenues towards recurring subscription-based revenues as the market evolution transfers value to these needed services. In other words when regulators unbundle exchange trading and clearing, exchanges have typically gone even further and unbundled the matching technology from data, access, oversight, and valuation services. And as such these fragmented markets create increased opportunities to provide valuation services, such as Interactive Data has found in the highly fragmented cash bond markets.","With a 98% revenue renewal rate, one of the highest revenue renewal rates that I've ever seen in any business, the market obviously craves an authoritative source for consistent, reliable price discovery. And where regulatory and structural issues keep markets balkanized or fragmented these valuation services prosper. Another trend that we are tapping into is the increasing sophistication of risk managers who value more real-time information rather than simply end of day mark. They also demand better analytical tools to help them consume real-time information. The growing trends towards investments and exchange traded funds and passive index investing is also increasing the demand for real-time evaluated pricing to support the innovation of these products. And we see markets like cash bonds and swaps moving from exclusive voice trading to hybrid voice and electronic trading, which is demanding the trusted evaluated pricing to encourage screen based [liquidities] and confidence in those prices that are displayed.","Take all of these trends together and you can see a very positive environment for ICE's risk management tools to grow. So we are taking a very strategic approach to evaluating our company and evolving it and an ever-increasing provider of value added services. I'd like to thank our customers for their business in the last quarter and I'm going to turn the call back over to Scott, who will close out the call with the last two slides. After that we will take your questions at the conclusion of his remarks.","Scott Hill","Thanks, Jeff. Please turn to Slide 13, where you will see a transaction summary. As disclosed in our press release on Monday, we agreed to buy Interactive Data Corporation for $5.2 billion. We will finance the $3.65 billion cash component with debt and will provide ICE shares worth $1.55 billion. In addition to the significant strategic benefits of the acquisition, which Jeff just described, we expect to realize $150 million in expense synergies. These synergies will come from the integration of corporate functions and from business efficiencies associated with reductions in technology expenses, business rationalizations and the elimination of redundant operations in the combined companies.","The expected cost synergies reflect just over 25% of Interactive Data's total expenses and we expect that within the first year after closing we will realize 25% of those synergies and as we mentioned in our release on Monday, this transaction will be more than 5% accretive in 2016. We have provided a detailed schedule in the appendix of our presentation that takes you through the accretion math. Interactive Data is a business with strong and improving profitability as well as robust cash flows, which will contribute meaningfully to our results. It is also a business that we believe will grow faster when combined with our ICE Data businesses and which offers the opportunity for margin expansion that will generate strong profit and cash growth. Acquiring good businesses with unique competitive advantages that we can improve upon is an important part of the strategy that has enabled us to deliver consistently strong growth year after year.","Slide 14 shows that trend. The acquisition of Interactive Data Corp. combined with the diverse business we already operate will enable us to continue this track record of growing EPS every full year since being a public company.","I will now hand the call to the operator who will conduct the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alex Kramm at UBS.","Alex Kramm","Hi, good morning, everyone. So obviously jumping right into this IDC transaction, maybe just starting with the outlook that you guys have for IDC, I think a lot of people noted that the growth rate has been a little bit lower over there, I think 3% to 4% or so. But you know having spent some time with the company recently, it sounds like they really were [invert focused] recently and [for last year's] and now are really in a position to grow. So wondering, what you see or what you model as the organic growth rate in that business over the next two years before kind of like ICE adds their secret sauce to it?","Jeffrey Sprecher","Sure. I think Alex we will have more to say over time once we actually own the business. But I think most people on the call that know the fixed income space know that there's a lot of changes going on in that market right now. The markets are becoming more transparent. The market participants are demanding more transparency. There's more movement on to some kind of transparent hybrid systems right now and those systems increasingly and the market participants who use those systems are increasingly going to want real-time valuations done, so that people can have some confidence in the price levels that are displayed. And so IDC has been moving on its own from providing end of day data to the ability to use technology to give more robust and more real-time interaction with their customers. They have huge -- for many years they have had a technology project underway to do this. They are coming into fruition of that. We are a technology company providing other kinds of valuation services. We think when we combine all of that we are going to have a really good, robust offering that will be highly valued by the marketplace and will continue to help serve the evolution of fixed income and other hard to value swaps and derivatives that are going to become more transparent.","Alex Kramm","All right, fair enough. And then maybe I will just go on the cost side here for a minute. I guess this is for Scott. Can you talk a little bit more about where those synergies are coming from? I think on the pricing side their margins are actually above 60% already. So is it going to be more on the trading solutions side, is it going to be more of moving your existing business on to their new technology? And then also, do you think you are going to shed some of these assets on the trading solutions side? I don't -- I think sums it well but there might be some others that are not really that core to what you're trying to build here.","Scott Hill","You pretty much answered the question, with your question. I think really Alex its across the board just that we are not going to go into a ton of detail. Now we will do that as we get closer to the close on the acquisition. But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks I think there are opportunities in a number of places. There is $100 million of corporate spend at Interactive Data. There clearly are overlaps from a corporate standpoint with what we got at ICE. You saw our ability to execute on that type of integration and in the NYX deal and frankly every deal we've done before that. There are definitely overlaps if you look at the trading solutions business. They have got a business [indiscernible] which is very similar to the Safety Network business that we have got at NYSE. They have got a desktop business which is similar to the desktop assets that we acquired with SuperDerivatives and frankly our Web ICE platform. So there are I think efficiencies we can get by combining those businesses. Definitely I think there is opportunity around the technology standards as we combine the two companies. So I think the playbook looks a lot like the NYX deal did in terms of where the synergy opportunities exist. There is also -- it's a pretty big real estate footprint. That's another area where we think there should be opportunity. I think we have done a pretty good job of consolidating locations over time. It's better for kind of our one team view as a company. It's also a means of generating efficiency. So look it's a very well-run company that where the profitability has continued to improve, but I definitely think there are multiple pockets of opportunity for synergies which gives us the confidence that we will be able to remove around 25% of the target's operating expenses.","Alex Kramm","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question is from Alex Blostein at Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","Hi, good morning everybody. Just following up on I guess on the data discussion. I was hoping you guys could focus a little bit on ICE's current data business clearly still pretty good growth there. So maybe spend a minute on Scott, that the components of the growth that you highlighted early in the call between new users, products, SuperDerivatives and Benchmark Administration. How much of that contributed maybe on a quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year basis kind of an organic -- in an organic state? Just trying to get a sense of the you know what does the growth in that business could look like before we incorporate IDC? Thanks.","Scott Hill","Sure. I would be happy to talk a little bit about that. We really haven't gone into a breakdown of the data revenues per se. Obviously as we integrate Interactive Data, one of the conversations we will have is, how to give you some more insights into that. But I think if you look at the year-over-year growth, a large portion of it in the third quarter is similar to what we've seen in the first and second quarters. We continue to see new users that want to consume the data that we are selling across our exchanges, whether it's the New York Stock Exchange or our commodity exchanges. There is significant and growing demand. We saw a big boost early in the year and frankly even from that higher customer count we saw it increase again in the second quarter and again in the third quarter. I've mentioned each quarter to you guys at ICE that I would expect the revenues next quarter to be similar. I have been wrong each time and that's because we continue to see growth in the customer demand. Clearly the SuperDerivatives revenue through the first three quarters was a net add, because we acquired the business. I would argue there as I have before that that beyond the acquisition of the revenue that is contributing to the growth we are still in the process of integrating that business and I think the real growth opportunity at SuperDerivatives is as we look into 2016. ICE Benchmark Administration had a very good quarter in the third quarter and continued really a trend where the first quarter was better than the fourth quarter, the second quarter was better than the first quarter and we had a very good quarter in the third quarter as well. So I would -- again the largest part of the growth drivers continues to be the growth in end-users consuming our exchange data, our proprietary data, but there's no question that SuperDerivatives and then in particular ICE Benchmark are also contributing to revenues. It not only is growing year-over-year but it has grown quarter after quarter after quarter.","Alex Blostein","Thanks. And then Jeff, slightly different direction of questions I guess. But over the course of the quarter, MiFID II came out with -- some of the final rules came out I guess there are still some details to be ironed out, but just curious to get your perspective on things like open access and position limits. How is that coming in relative to your expectations?","Jeffrey Sprecher","It's a good question. So -- some -- for those that haven't followed it specifically, some more detailed rules were published by the staff as to how this is going to work. But then above that, Commissioner Lord Hill who is the financial services commissioner in the EU has said let's take apart here and take a look at how the totality of all of this new regulation is going to work and make sure that some of these issues on access, position limits, the segregation of research from execution and these kinds of things. Let's take a look at how they're going to impact liquidity and the competitiveness of Europe. So there's a back channel story going on right now with a review of the rules that were just sort of promulgated. Those rules still have to be voted on and so the commissioner's theoretically in the EU -- the voters in the EU will ultimately have to decide whether or not these rules are going to leave the fragmentation, whether they are going to leave the increased systemic risk and whether or not they are going to make Europe less competitive as a result of some of the studies that are going on. So it's very hard to know specifically what the outcome is going to be. As a result of that we compare for a lot of different eventualities and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, one of the things that happens if there is fragmentation, is the value of data and market participants trying to reassemble the market for their own view goes way up. And that's partly been the strategic thinking around here, is to continue to build out our data services space as we may see a value shift away from execution towards reassemble and fragmentation.","Alex Blostein","Okay. Thanks for your perspective.","Operator","The next question is from Rich Repetto at Sandler O'Neill.","Rich Repetto","Good morning, Jeff, good morning, Scott. And I guess this is of a sort of follow-on for some of the other questions. But you know you laid out as we were expecting you would do, but compelling strategic rationale for IDC and market data. But I guess, getting back to the growth questions, when you look at the accretion at least -- we know you took out the buyback when you couple the 5.7. But was it even a concern to you to balance the growth of this -- of IDC versus sort of positioning [indiscernible] overall as a growth company or is it just that compelling or you are just that confident that you will get the growth? I am just trying to get I guess bigger a little bit further into what you were thinking and what are the concern of yours?","Scott Hill","Look I think Rich as we look at this business we absolutely believe there is an opportunity to grow it and for it to contribute to our overall growth profile. And frankly that's true at the top and the bottom line. Jeff talked about the opportunities of the combined businesses. There are a number of new products that that are in very early stages at Interactive Data that we are excited about. Clearly the $150 million of synergies is an opportunity I know that's not growth on the bottom line, but it grows the amount of profit and the amount of cash that we generate for our investors and as you know that's where our focus has always been. It's finding ways to generate more growth and more cash flows and I'm supremely confident that this business gives us that opportunity. I don't in any way see this as detracting from our overall growth profile. I frankly think it contributes to it. So we are very confident as we look at the company strategically, in terms of what it can do for us from a growth standpoint. Look I think -- I understand that the interest in looking at one year's worth of accretion, but we don't look at the valuation model, we look at the business over the longer term and I believe you will find over time that this business is absolutely another example of where we put return on invested capital at the top of the list when we evaluate the deals we do.","Rich Repetto","Okay. So I'm taking that answer that the growth was just as compelling as the strategic rationale for this.","Scott Hill","Embedded out exactly that way.","Rich Repetto","Okay. So my follow-up question. I got to do this to you Scott, so on market data -- as long as you talk about market data, the existing market data at ICE, you did some accounting restatements but it's still look like -- it looks like you moved about $13 million from other revenue into the market data even when you exclude the -- and this is a positive. But even when you exclude that, if you took $13 million off of market data, you are still growing $5 million quarter-to-quarter. And again just trying to get at the baseline of where we are at because you had sort of talked about being flat, number of about $10 [bet] you won last quarter.","Scott Hill","I do, I think I already fell on my sword earlier in one of my answers, but I will fall on it again. Look in the third quarter we did have a large customer true-up that occurred in the data business. Otherwise it would have been up only a little bit from where we were in the second quarter and I would been closer to right. But frankly I'd be -- I'm $4 million happier that I was wrong. So I do think that as you look to the fourth quarter, $206 million plus or minus in that line on the new basis is probably about where we will be. I'm just going to go ahead and say I could be wrong on that plus or minus $1 million or $2 million. But that's what I think the expectation is as you look into the fourth quarter. And again Rich, I mentioned on an earlier answer, the thing that I'm really pleased with, is we continue to see more customers consumer the data. And I will tell you that's the thing I keep missing in my remarks to you, is that, there continues to be growth and interest in the data business that we have got. And I think that feeds right back to your first question and Jeff's remark about why we are excited about Interactive Data. There is no question that the trend in the marketplace is that customers need more information. They need such people to help them take all the data that exists in the world and turn it into information they can use and that feeds right into the strategy and it's absolutely why I think that Interactive Data will contribute to and improve our growth profile and not detract from it.","Rich Repetto","Understood and congrats on the acquisition, guys.","Scott Hill","Thanks, Rich.","Operator","The next question is from Dan Fannon at Jefferies.","Dan Fannon","Good morning. Can you help us think about pricing power within IDC's business and how we should think about -- or essentially how you are thinking about that going forward in terms of raising prices for their existing offerings? And if you can also indicate when the last time they actually passed it on to their customers?","Jeffrey Sprecher","I think the short answer is we don't know, because we don't own the business and we are not talking to their customers. But generally the philosophy at ICE is not just to use -- is not to use \"pricing power.\" Our philosophy here is to increase the value add of whatever we provide and then couple that with an appropriate price increase. And think that attitude really would bode well for IDC because we do see a lot of new product opportunities that are already in progress there that are coming through the pipeline that will benefit from and our customers are going to have an opportunity for much more enriched view of the fixed-income markets with those products. I do note that there is a 98% revenue renewal with them. So obviously they are well-liked and well-respected at their current price levels or you wouldn't see that amazing continuation. But look for us to continue to be innovative with them and we think we will have an opportunity to do that.","Dan Fannon","Great. I guess just following on your existing market data business and pricing is it, is there any expectations for next year to see a general increase within certain of those services that we should be thinking about in terms of growth or incremental growth there?","Scott Hill","Yes. We will -- as we get onto the fourth quarter earnings call we will start to talk to you more about what we expect for 2016 in the core business. But suffice it to say that we continue to look for ways to add incremental value to our data packages and to the customers of our data services and as we have historically, as Jeff just alluded to we don't look to raise prices just to raise prices. We look to make sure our prices reflect the value that we are delivering and we will continue to evaluate that as we move not just into 2016 but in each subsequent year.","Dan Fannon","Great. Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo.","Chris Harris","Thanks, guys. We think about the exchanges industry, historically your peers have kind of grown data between 3% to 5% going back to a number of years. I think you guys internally have a much faster rate of growth forecast built in . And so Jeff, I know you highlighted a number of secular changes happening that should be really supportive of the data growth. But just wondering, if there's anything specific or unique about ICE's data mix that would drive faster growth than many peers in the industry?","Jeffrey Sprecher","Well I mean I think for ICE as a company that was a start up, what we have continued to see is a richer and richer data set. We started with data that was almost irrelevant and today are becoming quite an important data provider. And as we have gone through that transition and added more and more and more data and more services around data, what you have seen is cross-selling opportunities, the ability to build out a sales force that penetrates markets. And that's why Scott said, we continue to find new customers. I mean we are not thought of I suspect by most people as one of the historical data analytics spenders. There are some well-known, well-entrenched competitors in that space. So what we have been able to do is try to innovate, create some niche products, some things that are interested, very highly targeted to our customers because we run in commodity trading and clearing operations. We are having constant dialog with our customers on what their strategies on and how they are managing risk and we just continue to evolve our product set. So it's a better, faster, cheaper kind of strategy. But on top of that is the secular trend that I'm mentioning which is just regulatory pressures, fragmentation pressures and better and more interested ability by managers to have real-time information that's just growing I think the business for everybody.","Chris Harris","Got it. Makes sense. And really quick follow-up for Scott. Can you update us on where we are on NYSE synergies? How much more needs to come out there?","Scott Hill","Yes. So we continue to make good progress towards our overall objectives from the NYSE synergies. I think we have mentioned that as we exited this year we would be something like 90% done on those and we are well on track to that. And I think we clearly with some additional corporate functions that that will integrate next year, some real estate that we consolidated towards the end of this year and then as projects [indiscernible] moves on throughout 2015, I think that will push us towards the final synergies that we had committed originally.","Chris Harris","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Ken Hill of Barclays.","Ken Hill","Hi, good morning, everyone. I guess when I look at the data business, you guys are moving to with this acquisition here as well more of the hard to price products, some of the analytical stuff supported by the raw data, but it still looks like a good portion of your business today relates to some of that trading data from your futures exchange from your cash equities exchange versus sources like Safety, SuperDerivatives or IBA. So as you think about the outlook for maybe that core kind of raw data business there, as that becomes I guess a little bit more commoditized, how should we think about the competitive environment maybe the growth prospects there?","Scott Hill","Yes. As I mentioned I think the markets are going to continue to fragment. I think just -- all this new regulation that is going is really vulcanizing markets and the incumbent exchanges like ICE, we continue to challenge all the other exchanges around the world by listing their products and looking for niches. And so we -- there's just this trend that is going on right now that I think you are going to see markets fragment. So even raw data that comes from exchanges have to be consumed by people that are trying to resemble these markets. And so for a while, while we go through this transition I think even raw data is valuable. But what we are investing in and what we are building is really valuation services. If you look at what Interactive Data does, it really is a -- using technology to come up with valuations. If you look at what SuperDerivatives does, it's using technology to come up with valuations. If you look at our ETF calculator business, if you look at ICE Benchmark Administration, all of those are technological ways of trying to drive prices, related prices and couple that with this massive clearing system that I mentioned where we are also trying to take portfolios of positions and drive their actual risk. That's the value-added business and that's the business to grow. It does need the raw data as inputs, but the real value add and the things that people want to pay for is the technological piece and what we've built is a financial services technology company here that's been quite good at marshaling data around and understanding how these products all relate to one another. And I think that's the secret sauce where we are going to continue to invest.","Ken Hill","Okay. I know you guys a couple of times have mentioned new users as nice tailwind for the data business. What's really driving the uptick in new users? Is that something that you are ever doing with the sales force or are you really targeting specific groups or is that just having a product that no one else has and how can we think about the new user growth as you start to layer in a whole new large customer base here? And I guess do you need to invest more I guess in the sales force to get better integrated with some of these risk management groups or index groups over time?","Scott Hill","It\u2019s a combination of both. We do have a lot of proprietary products, things that we have created around here that are not unlike IDC, where we are getting data out of cash markets and markets that don't trade on exchanges. And coupling those with the more commoditized data and selling it as a package, which is part of what we have been able to do. In terms of the sales force we now have Interactive Data Corporation there is going to be an amazing sales force footprint that comes with that company that will be able to blend together with our sales force and really I think be able to touch a lot of customers. I mean, we mentioned in the prepared remarks that IDC's customer base is literally every significant asset manager, every significant bank and fund around the world. So in that group are people that we don't touch and some of them won't have any particular interest in some of the things we do, but some will because of just their breadth and size and scale of some of these companies that I think are going to want to see a lot of things. The other trend that is going on is that the passive investment trend is just people creating more and more unique portfolios that need real-time valuation and that business for us, is it's partly what leads to our 95% listings market share of ETFs in the United States and how we have been able to approach that business. And we're going to get better and better and better at that with the addition of Interactive Data's valuation skills.","Ken Hill","Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","The next question is from Ken Worthington at JPMorgan.","Ken Worthington","Hi, good morning. First maybe for Scott, balance sheet and leverage. With so much recurring revenue now, why is 1.5 times leverage the right number and what are your thoughts about pushing the balance sheet more given the revenue mix with IDC? And then in terms of deleveraging I think in the prepared remarks you talked about doing it over two years and it seems like in my model I could get you to delever much more quickly. So maybe is there a lot of CapEx that you expect with this deal or would you continue to be buying back stock as you delever? What's the thought there?","Scott Hill","So I think our target remains to operate around 1.5 times. That is the expectation that the ratings agencies have for a company that's a single-A, which is what we believe is appropriate for the company. In terms of why, that's their view, I agree with you it is a much stronger recurring revenue base, but that is the view the ratings agencies take and we think that rating is important to us as the operator of the largest clearing operations in the world. So we are going to continue to target getting back to around that number. In terms of the time it takes to deleverage, I think we have conservatively said that it would take two years. I think the point is that while we will continue to pay our dividends, our cash flows will go to deleveraging. You'll likely recall from the NYX deal that we were able to deleverage faster than we had originally anticipated. I am hopeful that that will be the case here as well. But as we sit here today, as I look at the models that we put together I think that the two-year deleveraging path is a reasonable expectation with a continuation in dividend and not doing share repurchases.","Ken Worthington","Okay. Great. And then Jeff, the deal is being pitched as a way to accelerate IDC's growth but does it work the other way around as well? Does IDC help ICE's core business? And some of my thoughts but they could all be bogus, but like does it help move business on screen? Does it help risk management or margining on the clearing side? Does it drive volumes maybe to greater level? So how does IDC help ICE's business?","Jeffrey Sprecher","You nailed it. That's exactly how we are thinking about it. The operation of clearinghouses you know used to be a back-office function that was not thought about. Today it is a real business and in fact it is a business that's been mandated by regulation and is going to become more and more regulated and the opportunity to grow it is going to be, because we become more and more sophisticated. And valuation is what we do. That's what a clearing platform is. And so when we decided to try to help the large financial institutions get the credit default swaps off their balance sheets after the Lehman collapse, we had to develop all new models and we had the higher large staffs of quantitative analysts that could figure out how to value a product that had been mis-valued prior to that. And we really have developed the skills set there and we just saw that opportunity is like -- the light bulb went on and said, we should just continue to build out those valuation systems and we should be the best in the world because that would be our competitive advantage over the long haul for clearing. Increasingly because of capital constraints on banks and others the market's going to want to have sophisticated valuation of their collaterals and wider and broader types of collateral that can be accepted and that's only going to be allowed by regulators if they have confidence in the people that are operating these things, if that collateral can be stress-tested and properly valued. So it's all -- it's a holistic view of where the market is changing. As I mentioned we started the company by creating an electronic matching engine. Today we have competitors that will actually pay market participants to use their matching engine. I mean so the matching engine itself, which was the thing that was so valuable that started this company at the height of the dotcom boom, today others are not only giving it away for free but will pay people to use it. So there has been a transition of where the market is perceiving the value of these marketplaces and it's really in the risk management capabilities and that's where we have been investing since 2007.","Ken Worthington","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Good morning, folks. Maybe just ask a question for Scott, switch to the cost side, the $25 million in cost is going to $150 million by the end of year three. Can you just touch on the run rate of that, if that's a linear growth rate into $150 million or if there are other step functions in that? And if you can also refresh us on what you think the NYSE cost save run rate will be in 4Q this year and then just refresh us on the incremental cost saves for 2017 from NYSE?","Scott Hill","Yes. So just with regards to the Interactive Data center deal the $150 million, we noted that we expected that we would be able to realize roughly 25% of those synergies in the first year post close, so effectively 2016. My expectation is from there you'll see it's likely about 65% done give or take a little bit as we move through '17 and then move the large majority completed in '18 with some and subsequently delivered in '19. So that's kind of how I am thinking about the run rate right now. Clearly as Jeff alluded to and I have mentioned a couple of times we've got work to do once we are able and then close the deal to refine some of those assumptions and obviously we will be back to talk to you about it. With regards to the NYSE synergies, as I've mentioned, we are two years' post close of that deal now. We have bought businesses. We have invested in businesses. Trying to show you where inside our synergies you see an exact number, I think it is difficult to do. What I'd point you to is the quarter that despite a significant adjustment in our bonus accrual was nearly 60% margins, margins that were right on track to where we said they would be two years ago. And then I would prefer right back to the remarks I made earlier which is, we are exactly on pace to where we thought we would be at this point and we have got the [actions] that are necessary to help us complete those synergies as we move through 2016. And again where you are going to see that is going to be in our margins. It will not be easily seen embedded in what is a highly evolved and different expense base than existed two years ago.","Brian Bedell","Okay. Great. And then a question for Jeff. Just to [stare] this big picture on the data business as you put everything together and clearly the revenue synergies from IDC seem compelling longer term. As you think about when you have IDC in the run rate fully and SuperDerivatives is fully integrated, how do you view the longer term growth in the data business for ICE inclusive of the synergies over time? And then if you also want to weigh in -- later in the potential pricing model for the ICE Benchmark Administration which sounds like it still has a good sort of hockey stick upside to it?","Jeffrey Sprecher","Yes. It's hard to know. I just -- my -- I view my job as really trying to identify the trends and behaviors in the industry and get our boat oriented towards those wins and get the [sale] put out there. And as you can see right now and we can see it in our own data that that in our own customer usage data and the conversations anecdotally we are having with customers as this change is going on in the market. I know just -- I just re-up my cell phone plan and I bought more data. So an individual somehow I'm consuming more data and the tools for me to do that get better and better and I have got them on a phone I keep in my pocket. So that's is a microcosm of what\u2019s going on a bigger scale in the risk management business and we have got the sail in the wind here and I think it's going to have legs, because I really do think underneath it in addition to regulatory pressures which are not going to go way, fragmentation pressures which I don't think are going to go away, even though end-users don\u2019t love that. But the powers of vulcanization are pretty big right now. I think this trend is going to last for a while.","Brian Bedell","And then just on the Benchmark Administration business in terms of the pricing model where are you in that stage of evolution? Is there a lot more to come down the road?","Jeffrey Sprecher","Well it's an immature company. We just announced another new product that we're going to start here in October, but when we stepped back and looked at our portfolio I mean what's amazing is ICE as a owner of key benchmarks now with LIBOR, with Brent crude oil and gasoil with many of our major natural gas indices, with the dollar index. We have on our own, acquired and owned a very interesting portfolio of indices and the move towards passive investing is coming also into the commodity and derivatives space. It\u2019s following what you see in the equity space and those key assets become more and more valuable and people are -- there is more interest in them. And so we are at a very immature stage.","Operator","The next question is from Chris Allen at Evercore.","Chris Allen","Morning, guys. Jeff you have kind of harped on the fragmentation thesis moving forward and for IDC they are continuous about [indiscernible] fixed-income, the real-time data products seems very compelling. Just wanted to figure out if you have given any thoughts in terms of what the market opportunity there is in terms of revenue and whether that can be leveraged into trading platforms for some of the cash bond markets that are out there and which markets if any you think are primed to take the step towards electronic trading?","Jeffrey Sprecher","Well we will have more to say on that over time as we own the business and are able to talk to people with market participants, but clearly there is a trend that's going on for more transparency around the fixed-income markets. And as people are increasingly concerned about what is liquidity available in those market there is going to be more and more pressure to be able to see that liquidity and have it displayed in some manner. So in record data is already pretty active in that area supporting others, third party platforms and some of the new generation of entrepreneurs that are trying to solve that problem. We have a number of initiatives going on that are actually doing well in the fixed-income space that are derivative of our credit default swap business that we may be able to help super charge. So, I am cautiously optimistic that nut will get cracked. It would be nice if it was us, but if it's not we are going to certainly support other entrepreneurs because this real-time data is incredibly valuable and helpful to somebody trying to solve that problem.","Chris Allen","Got it. And then just a quick one, on the financing for the deal, the debt being raised at 2.75%. if I recall I think you have about $2 billion you can tap for commercial paper and then I am assuming that will be tapped in the rest of the raise in the public markets, is that correct when we think about it?","Jeffrey Sprecher","I don\u2019t think we will likely exhaust all of the CP capacity and I think the bond markets right now are attractive for a company that there is an investment -- a solid investment-grade company like ours and I think it's likely that you'll see us work to take advantage of that attractive market in terms of our ability to fix some of that debt structure over time.","Chris Allen","Thanks guys.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Sprecher for any closing remarks.","Jeffrey Sprecher","Thank you Amy. Thanks all for joining us this morning. We are excited about we are doing and we will continue to refine our analysis and comments and be prepared on our next quarter call to give you further insight into our strategy and how it's going to evolve for shareholders. So thank you very much. Have a great day.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

When used on this call net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses, adjusted net income refers to adjusted net income from continuing operations, and adjusted earnings refer to adjusted diluted continuing operations earnings per share.","With us on the call are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Charles Vice, President and Chief Operating Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Scott.","Scott A. Hill - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Kelly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll begin on slide four by highlighting our strong performance in the first half of 2015. We grew adjusted earnings 27% year-to-year on 6% revenue growth with commodities, cash equities, data services and listings all contributing top-line growth. Adjusted expenses declined 6% and adjusted margins expanded 6 points. The revenue growth and margin expansion generated operating cash flow of $770 million in the first half, which enabled us to deploy around $300 million in capital expenditures and business investments like Amex and OCC while returning $560 million to investors.","Now please turn to slide five, where we detail our second quarter financial results. Adjusted earnings per share rose 27% from the prior year to $2.90. Net revenues grew 6% year-over-year to $797 million. This includes record revenues for data services and for NYSE listings and strong growth in commodities revenues. Adjusted operating expenses declined 8% from the prior second quarter and adjusted operating margin reached 59%. Our adjusted tax rate of 28% was at the lower end of our range in the quarter due to a number of discrete items. For the second half of the year we expect our tax rate to be closer to the middle of the 28% to 31% range.","Let's move on to slide six, and I'll discuss the drivers of our 6% revenue growth. Transaction revenue accounted for 56% of net revenue during the second quarter. Our net transaction and clearing revenues declined 3% year-to-year due primarily to continued interest rate volume weakness in Europe. Commodities revenue increased 8% year-to-year on strength in our oil, natural gas and ag markets, and revenues also grew in our FX and cash equities markets. Non-transaction revenues grew 20% and represented 44% of net revenues. This included data services revenues, which were up 29% to a record $191 million, driven by the addition of new users and product offerings. NYSE listings revenues grew 12% year-to-year to a record $101 million, reflecting the NYSE's continued global leadership in IPOs and capital raisings.","Next, on slide seven I'll detail the revenue performance across our futures exchanges for the second quarter. Despite muted activity in interest rate markets, revenues from futures and options declined just 2% from the prior second quarter. Energy and ag volume in revenue growth was solid, including global oil and sugar revenues, which increased 11% and 20% respectively versus the prior year. Total open interest across all of our exchanges has increased 3% from the beginning of 2015, and, notably, volatility in European short-term interest rates picked up during the month of July with daily volume in our rates complex up 17% over the prior July, contributing to overall derivatives volumes, which were up 1%.","Total volumes in July actually grew 7% when you exclude European single stock equities volumes. The revenue associated with that trading activity is capped and, thus, there is very little correlation between volumes and revenue. To ensure our volume metrics better align with transaction revenues, we will exclude single stock equities volumes from our volume and RPC metrics beginning in August and we will provide updated historical information on that same basis on our website.","Turning to slide eight, I'll expand on the performance of our energy markets. During the quarter, global oil revenue increased 11%, including Brent and Other Oil revenues, up 11% and 15% respectively. ICE Brent, along with hundreds of related oil products, remains the global benchmark relied upon by producers and consumers. Revenues also grew in gasoil and WTI, as did volume and open interest. From the beginning of the year through the end of June, open interest in our global oil complex is up 8%. Our natural gas markets also performed well in the second quarter, benefiting from increased volatility resulting in revenue and volume growth of 7% year-over-year.","Moving along to slide nine, I'll provide an update on revenues from our swaps markets. Total credit derivatives revenues for the quarter were $34 million, including $22 million in CDS clearing revenues. This sequential decline in clearing revenues was primarily due to the $3 million accounting adjustment that we noted in our first quarter results. For the full year 2015, we expect clearing revenues to increase from the prior year and to exceed $100 million as we continue to add more products and see increased interest from buyside clients.","Growth in European buyside participation continued in the quarter and accounted for 34% of the gross notional cleared in the first half at ICE Clear Credit, our U.S. swaps clearing house. CDS clearing activity in the U.S. remains robust due to our comprehensive product offering, portfolio margining and the relative regulatory certainty in the U.S.","Please turn to slide 10. The New York Stock Exchange continues to grow revenue and gain share reaching 24.4% share of the U.S. cash equities market in the second quarter, up from 22.7% in the prior second quarter. We have improved revenue capture and grown revenue consistently since completing the acquisition in 2013 by focusing on the needs of our customers and simplifying markets. Share in our equity options markets was stable versus the first quarter. And after purchasing the remaining 16% stake in the Amex business at the end of June, we saw a share increase in July. Importantly, we will retain 100% of the profit from the Amex options business starting in the third quarter. So, in our equity options business, share is stable to improving, and the profit contribution from the business is increasing. We continue to focus on the evolution of our options market as we shift from a neutralized structure to one that is focused on innovating across the NYSE, Amex and Arca options markets.","We've historically focused on aggregate expense management and revenue performance by business line. That notwithstanding, I want to eliminate any misperception about the significant profit contribution we are realizing from the New York Stock Exchange. The combination of improved share and stable revenue capture in cash equities continued listings leadership, diverse data offerings, the elimination of corporate redundancy and significant operational improvement increased NYSE's adjusted operating margin above 50% in the second quarter of 2015. That's a nearly twofold increase versus 2012. And as we continue to serve our customers, implement technology improvement and streamline NYSE's operations, we expect the profit contribution from the NYSE business to continue to increase as margins expand.","Moving on to slide 11. As I just mentioned, we continued to extend our global leadership in listings in the second quarter and the first half of 2015. Listings revenue grew 12% over the prior second quarter to $101 million. We also led in global proceeds, raising $95 billion in 264 transactions during the first half of the year. We have a robust IPO pipeline for the second-half and we are investing in our team and resources to support our listed companies.","Slide 12 reflects the continued strength of our data services business. For the quarter, data services revenues were a record $191 million, up 29% over the prior second quarter. This was primarily driven by the addition of new data products and growth in our customer base coupled with the addition of SuperDerivatives and the emergence of ICE Benchmark Administration.","Turning to slide 13, I'll move from a focus on revenues to a discussion of our second quarter expenses. As you can see, adjusted expenses declined 8% year-over-year to $328 million. Expenses were better than guidance, primarily due to accelerated synergies coupled with reduced non-cash compensation expenses related to a large number of resource reductions during the quarter and a large recovery in technology expenses. Compensation, professional services and SG&A expenses continued to decline as we integrate our businesses, eliminate overlapping roles and reduce contractor levels.","Technology and D&A expenses increased from the prior second quarter due to investment to improve our NYSE technology platform, to enhance our listed customer offerings and to enable our ongoing integration and the consolidation of our global real estate footprint. This continued focus on strong expense management enabled adjusted operating margins to expand to 59% in the second quarter, a 6-point improvement versus the prior year. We expect expenses in the third and fourth quarters to be in the range of $330 million to $335 million, which means our full-year expense should be at or slightly below the low-end of our prior guidance and approximately 4% lower than in 2014.","If you move to slide 14, I'll quickly cover our cash flow and capital structure. In the first half of 2015 we generated $770 million in operating cash flow. At June 30 we had $700 million in unrestricted cash and short-term investment including just under $200 million in additional regulatory capital that will be required when ICE Clear Europe receives EMIR authorization. On June 30 we paid off our $1 billion 2015 euronotes. Our total debt now stands at $3.3 billion and our adjusted debt to EBITDA is 1.6 times.","I'll conclude my remarks on slide 15 with an update on our uses of capital. As you can see we have used all of our operating cash for capital return, opportunistic M&A and capital expenditures. In the second quarter we returned nearly $290 million to our shareholders. We repurchased $203 million of shares during the second quarter and continued to opportunistically buy back our shares. We also paid $85 million in dividends, representing a 15% increase in demonstrating our commitment to grow dividends as we grow. We expect to maintain around $500 million in unrestricted cash and equivalents and a leverage ratio around 1.5 times. We otherwise expect to use 100% of cash flow to return capital to shareholders and to deploy towards growth investments that meet or exceed our return expectations. Importantly, our strong balance sheet and cash generation coupled with our access to debt market should enable us to return significant amount of capital without limiting in any material way our ability to act opportunistically when we identified growth opportunities.","Our strong first-half performance reflects the execution of our financial and strategic objectives. Revenues grew 6% and adjusted earnings grew 27% even as we integrated multiple acquisitions, invested in growth initiatives and returned $560 million to shareholders. And importantly, we have established solid momentum that will carry through the remainder of this year and into 2016. I'll be happy to answer any questions during Q&A. And I'll now hand the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Scott, and good morning. Our 27% earnings growth in the quarter was driven by strength across our company. And our record first-half revenue and record first-half earnings are consistent with our objective of delivering strong top-line and bottom-line growth. We delivered growth in our energy, agriculture and equities markets, as well as in market data and in listings; we're integrating our acquired companies, and advancing numerous technology and strategic initiatives to address our customers' needs.","Our team is adept at managing change, consistently evolving and growing our business since its inception. We've moved from an electronic trade execution venue for over-the-counter markets to becoming a global network of exchanges and more recently pursuing clearings, data services and expanding our listings franchise. And we're striking a balance between high value, recurring revenues and more commoditized volumetric revenues.","Our progress in quickly reshaping historically low margin businesses to increase margins through improvements is evident in the NYSE and Liffe operations. Significant cost efficiencies remain in our sights; and as our revenues continue to rise, this should amplify our earnings growth in the coming years.","We've also positioned ICE alongside long-term secular trends coupled with improving cyclical dynamics. And I'll walk through some f these starting on slide 16. Demand continues to rise for our products and services due to the globalization of markets and the increasing need for risk management. The significance of data services and clearing is rising with the additional collateral, treasury, benchmark and valuation services that we are developing. As such, much of the value we add today cannot be measured through trading volume. This is evident in the chart on slide 16 where trading volume trends have become a less reliable indicator of our earnings growth.","Over the last four quarters, while trading volumes have declined on a year-over-year basis, our earnings per share has consistently grown at a strong double-digit rate. Our continued top-line revenue growth including revenues up 6% in the first half of the year is driven by our anticipation of changing customer needs. At the same time we compete in our trading volume based businesses from a position of strength, owning globally relevant benchmark contracts integrated with risk management and data services.","We differentiated our approach by locating in the major market centers where our customers operate. As we reach for global growth, we plan to launch our Singapore-based exchange and clearing house in the fourth quarter and we built ICE Trade Vault data repositories in the U.S., Canada, Europe to serve unique reporting requirements. We believe that our geographic diversity is increasingly important as regulation and capital requirements continue to diverge across these jurisdictions.","In response to customer requirements for products that are more capital efficient we've launched our ERIS products which replicate the economics available in swaps within a futures contract, while we are also taking a leading role in meeting the demand for swaps clearing in the U.S. and Europe. And, as you saw during July our leading European interest rate franchise demonstrated that when volatility returned during the month trading volumes responded with a 17% increase year-to-year, driven by Euribor and Sterling. We are very well positioned across our global financial products franchise including our MSCI index volumes, which are up more than 30% and foreign exchange volumes up more than 100% year-to-date through July.","In our equities markets we're focused on innovating and growing the NYSE. We're introducing new technology, reducing market complexity and promoting liquidity by developing a mid-day auction. As the global leader in capital raising, we're focused on all aspects of our listings business. We continue to lead in IPOs across virtually all segments, including technology, REITs and ETFs. This is due to the clear advantages that we offer from our strong visibility, issuer advocacy and our unique market model which improves the ability of our listed companies to issue new equity or buy back their shares.","Turning to slide 17, I'll highlight how our diverse global markets continue to provide near-term and long-term growth. Recently we've seen growth in our European rates and U.S. natural gas trading volumes, demonstrating how quickly volatility can return to markets. Longer term, as Western economies continue to move towards natural gas, we're very well positioned with over 100 listed natural gas contracts, including key natural gas benchmarks across the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and Continental Europe.","In our global oil complex we continue to benefit from price volatility and the demand for energy price hedging that is coming out of Asia through ICE Futures Europe. With nearly two decades of record annual volumes in the ICE Brent contract, there continue to be many drivers of its long-term volume growth. These include price volatility, changing supply and demand expectations, regulations, the adoption of Brent as a global oil benchmark, geopolitics and the shifts in hedging strategies.","Turning to what's next, I mentioned earlier that we have a number of technology initiatives that are underway. For example, immediately after closing on the NYSE transaction, we began investing to reduce the complexity of the exchange's five trading platforms into one modern system. We plan to begin broad industry testing of our new NYSE Pillar platform over the next couple of months.","I'll now turn to ICE Benchmark Administration and the important role that we're playing to rebuild confidence in the benchmark setting process. We've been working closely with the industry and regulators since beginning our work on LIBOR, and have deployed improved governance, transparency, systems and oversight that's required for this new era.","With over $350 trillion in gross notional value that is tied to LIBOR, ICE Benchmark Administration is applying significant resources to reform the rate setting process. And through a market consultation that was announced last week, we're reviewing each aspects of LIBOR's methodology and calculations, including more transaction data included in the process. We've received very strong feedback from the 22 banks that are now submitting rates as part of our process. In addition, the new gold price auction has proceeded very well with record volume since its launch this year and with the number of direct participants expanding from 4 to 10 in the recent months.","In our data services business we're working on building out our Safety network, which is an increasingly valuable piece of market infrastructure that we acquired with the NYSE. As secure connectivity becomes increasingly vital to market participants, we've seen strong interest in access to our network.","I'll conclude on slide 18, which is the same slide on which Scott opened his remarks, in order to emphasize that we're delivering consistent growth by executing on our strategic plan. We're off to a great start in 2015 with record first-half revenues, record operating income and record earnings. We've transitioned from generating revenues that were approximately 90% transaction-based related to one asset class to an approximate 60% transaction-based revenue business that is now levered to multiple asset classes, multiple geographies and multiple growth drivers. This is why we're confident in our strategy.","We've uniquely delivered growth each year through all phases of the business cycle. Our margins are rising; earnings growth is consistently strong; and we're delivering the best revenue and earnings performance in our history. And as we move into the back half and the coming year, we've identified significant opportunities across revenues and expenses that are yet to be realized to ensure that our strong track record continues.","So on behalf of the ICE team, I want to thank our customers for trusting us with their business in this excellent quarter for us.","And I'll now ask Keith, our operator, to open up the call for a question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes. Thank you. And the first question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, guys. Maybe just an update on some of the regulatory items that are going on in the industry and, I guess, most importantly, probably equivalents and then (23:02) EMIR points. You mentioned, with Singapore launching, you're going to have the clearing houses in the exchanges globally. So I just wanted to get an update on your thoughts on where the potential concentration or where those end markets (23:16) will be going depending on how some of these regulations turn out?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Why don't I move \u2013 I'll move geographically across the globe. So starting with the U.S., we've been participating in a number of panels and hearings and conversations that have been going on with the CFTC regarding the potential implementation of position limits and how those should go into markets. Particularly, we're concerned about how the commodity markets operate. I think you're aware that we built our business around the commercial users of hedging tools and commodities.","And we are trying to make sure that those kinds of reliable and diligent people have access to markets so that they can use them to hedge and continue to manage risk in their businesses. I feel like that constituency is much more engaged now in this conversation and our regulators are listening and trying to find their way through that. So, honestly, we feel like there is a very good, healthy dialogue going on in the United States. And we feel like, as a company, we've positioned ourselves with the right group of customers to continue to grow as we have been through all phases of increased regulation in the United States.","In Europe, you mentioned the equivalents conversation. We're deeply involved in the conversations on both sides of that. Publicly, the regulators have stated that they're moving closer to a deal. It looks like, to us, from basically everything we see, that they are working in earnest, that a deal is within sight. We think that they've done a very good job of gathering a lot of data, so that the policies that they implement will be data-driven, which has been important for us and we've participated in providing data and running analytics and scenarios so that people can be educated.","So we feel good about the direction of that and have no reason to believe that they won't come to a deal as they \u2013 both sides have suggested they are moving towards. Based on our conversations, it looks like the areas that they're negotiating over would be helpful for the markets in that it will continue to allow for strong risk management but won't necessarily impede or significantly change the way people do business.","Moving to Asia, we are anxious to launch our Singapore exchange in clearinghouse. We've done all the work that we've needed to do, put the staff in place, the systems in place, and are basically ready to go, but we really benefit as a company from being a global network, a global distribution, and our goal is to bring a lot of non-traditional global players to Singapore to do business.","And so, it's taken our customers longer to get set up than we anticipated. We don't want to launch the exchange until major customers can have access. We think the best \u2013 it was in our best interest to slow down and give our customers a chance to catch up to us, and so we're now planning that in the fourth quarter of this year we think there'll be significant mindshare there around the exchange that will allow us to have a successful launch.","That's kind of the lay of the land, it's all work in progress but broadly speaking a lot of really good healthy dialog going on across the world as regulators are struggling to implement a lot of new rule changes but do it in a way that's consistent globally and also that doesn't impede people that are trying to use the markets in healthy ways.","Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's helpful. And then, Scott, you gave an update on the second half on expenses. They continue to be well managed, but just wanted to get an update on 2016 and 2017 just on the synergy timeline, if anything's changed or more or less in line with what you've said in the past.","Scott A. Hill - Chief Financial Officer","No. I think, Mike, we continue to make very good progress on the projects that made us that $550 million of synergies. As I mentioned the performance in the quarter really reflects an acceleration of those synergies and the efforts around it. So I feel good about the projects we've identified, I feel good about the progress that we're making, and we continue to be very focused not just on the synergies but on expense management generally.","Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Ken Hill with Barclays.","Kenneth W. Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Scott A. Hill - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Kenneth W. Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just wanted to kind of follow up there last on the Singapore exchange. I know the timeline's been a little bit more drawn up than you guys initially expected, but you've mentioned the fourth quarter launch you have customers get on board. I was hoping you could remind us as to what your initial goals are as we turn into 2016 what we should be looking for there with the Singapore exchange.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Really, as managers, our hope is that we have a successful launch. We have a handful of products that we have talked to a lot of customers about in Asia that they want to trade, and we want to have a successful launch of the exchange, get people used to using the exchange in clearing house, get the connectivity around it and so \u2013 and be able then to plug that into our global distribution network. And the goal is to just have this nice, successful launch because we have the intention of launching a lot of new products and there's a lot of demand coming from our Asian customers for new products in the region.","So what you see us doing is trying to find a couple of products that we think will have appeal, that the appeal will be broad enough that it will bring global distribution to Asia. But, the real intent there is not that any one of those things is necessarily a homerun, we want to have a solid start to the business because we do intend to continue to invest in there and there really does seem to be strong demand for trading in the region.","Kenneth W. Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And just a follow-up on CDS business, I know you guys on the slide deck have the target there for clearing revenues of above $100 million. Versus where we were in 2Q I know you had some one-off adjustments. Can you give us some color on what you're hearing from clients that gives you a little bit more confidence in that greater than $100 million number?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. That's a really good question, Ken. And really our willingness to commit that we'll be over $100 million for the year is based on customer feedbacks. We're seeing a lot of positive momentum now with buyside customers in particular and single-names and importantly in advance of any mandate. I mean, we've got mandates from the CFTC on indexes, but we don't have mandates in single-name and that notwithstanding we're seeing growth in interest because I think there is a view that for the market to really succeed, clearing is an important element of that.","And so you've seen a couple buyside firms that have written about that, we have the most comprehensive offering of single-name products, the most comprehensive offering of sovereign names, have talked \u2013 talked about our intention during the second half to launch the U.K., France and Germany sovereign names. So I'm encouraged by the product launches that we have in front of us, the buy-side customer feedback that we're getting and just the nature of the business that we've built which I think provides not only a foundation for us to do well the rest of this year but to continue to grow out into 2016 and 2017.","Kenneth W. Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks. That's helpful color. Thanks for taking my question.","Operate: Thank you. And the next question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Yeah. Good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Scott.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Scott A. Hill - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Congrats on the strong quarter here. I guess my first question is on the market data and, Jeff, you spent a fair amount of time emphasizing on calls and this demand for more data by the customers and what you do \u2013 that it isn't just price increases, but it's content increases too. So I guess could you get into more color on what exactly you're providing the value here? And then, Scott, you said it was going to be \u2013 or I think the guidance was flat; it grew by $4 million. So, where can it go for the next couple of quarters?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. So I think the trend that we see and that we saw and have moved towards is this demand for more and more data. We all know, all of us that follow this industry saw the emergence of algorithmic traders that were consuming a lot of data and then figuring out very quickly how to place trades, well that kind of an analytics is now making its way on to desktops and into buyside firms and people now are increasingly having the capability to handle a lot of data and to analyze it and to find trends or other opportunities or to use it for risk management and hedging activities in this dataset.","And one of the things that has the nice luxuries of the company that we've built is that we've now moved into multiple asset classes as you've seen, including over-the-counter products, listed commodities and listed derivatives and now equities and equity options, and we've done that globally. And so we have quite a package of data and are able to put things together in interesting ways to help serve the needs of our customers. And so, when we were a small company our data wasn't this rich and honestly we didn't have as deep of appreciation as how data was going to be consumed as we do today.","So what you've seen us do is put Lynn Martin now in charge of a new data operation to organize across all of our businesses to gather data, and it's paying dividends. Like Scott mentioned in his prepared remarks that revenues were up 20% in that area which is \u2013 or 20% across our fixed businesses and 29% in data, which is an interesting place for us to position the company, it's why Scott and I both mentioned in our prepared remarks.","We think we're just scratching the surface. We just are integrating these businesses, we just put Lynn as an executive to oversee the integration and so we have strong appetite, we think, to continue to grow these businesses.","Scott A. Hill - Chief Financial Officer","And I won $10, Rich, that you called me out on my guidance being a little off. The point I've made is the \u2013 it's an expansive business that Lynn is running. It's through traditional data services that ICE has had where we sold data in the back offices that allow them to mark their books. The Safety business at NYSE that Jeff talked about in his prepared remarks where people want to get connectivity into our exchange, it's direct connect into ICE's exchanges. And so there are a number of pieces that move around, the overall visibility is good not perfect.","My expectation is the data services revenues are going to grow strongly every single quarter. Sequentially, I still think a relatively accurate projection for the year is that 3Q and 4Q look like 2Q. Could it be a couple of million higher in those some of those quarters based on the more connections or greater data sales or continued customer growth or SuperDerivatives' performance? It could be. I think that's the conservative assumption. I think the more important point versus what do we think about the third quarter or the fourth quarter is what do we think long-term, and this is a growth business for us. And it's a significant growth opportunity for us as you move into 2016 and then out into 2017.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Got it. I'll rebate you that $10, Scott. My follow-up question, Jeff, would be every quarter you position the company as a growth company and it has been. And I guess it has to do with the NYSE and you've talked a lot about the improvement in margins of 50% and the growth and now you're 100% of the Amex contribution; I'd love to understand what that is. But I guess the bigger question now is once the synergies are done and looking at the company, the key \u2013 if revenue was \u2013 wanted revenue to grow mid-single digits, can you still grow when you don't have the synergies?","And then looking at the NYSE, again, I would assume a lot of the growth is from cost savings and I know you've done well with market share but the point being, you may not be getting the value for that either. So again the question about growth after the synergies are done at the NYSE and the valuation there.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, you're right in that. We've taken a lot of costs out of the business and we've been able to do that because we're a larger organization that can lever off of other businesses. And there's more to go there. We still haven't put our technology in place, we're making large investments in the way we oversee our markets and compliance and other tools that we think will really make us a better compliance organization and more efficient. So there's still a lot to go there on the expense side, but we've really been growing revenues.","And this idea that we had in simplifying markets we now want to simplify technology, we are really \u2013 have a new team in place that's really pursuing a lot of listings and the top-line is growing. And we think the trends are in our favor. We're going to put a mid-day auction in, the SEC has worked with us on a tick pilot that's going to go into place that's going to test various market models around the listed business. And we see potential upside in all of that.","The other thing that happens, Rich, is that, what, the exhaust of the New York Stock Exchange is a pretty rich dataset. And that dataset is something, along with the Safety network that we inherited with that, is something that we've now been exploiting to add to it and enrich it with other data. And so, we think that we will be able to grow the top-line of that business when you look at it collectively for years to come.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","So, I guess the point is you think you can grow earnings post-synergies?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Oh yes. Absolutely. Absolutely. And we don't see right now any limitations. And the levers that we're pulling seem to be working and the trends, really. All things being equal, we really believe that buyers are looking for sellers and sellers are looking for buyers, and that markets don't want to be fragmented. The fragmentation comes when there's payment for order flow where intermediaries are incented to do something on their personal behalf, and less so on their customer behalf. Where algorithmic traders benefit from the fragmentation, where corporate traders may not have balance sheet attached to their \u2013 the use of the corporate balance sheet attached to their pay. And so they are looking for economic incentives and will actually trade slightly off-market in order to lower execution costs, if you will, that they get paid against.","And so you have a lot of disincentives in the markets that have caused a lot of fragmentation, and as there's more regulation, as there's more focus on the bottom-line, as people are really having a really healthy debate about the fiduciary responsibility of exchanges and brokers and intermediaries, those trends are allowing what the natural market wants, which is for buyers to find sellers and for these things to come back to more organized listed venues. And we've seen that trend. I'd like to say that everything we're doing has caused it, but it's not, that is not the cause. There is a macro trend in place that we're moving the business into.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Understood. Thanks. Very helpful, Jeff. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning. I guess one more question on market data. You talked about the growth in new users, and I was wondering if there's any kind of stats or kind of good color you can put around where they're coming from geographically or anything to be a little more helpful there.","Scott A. Hill - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I mean, not a lot that we put out publicly on that, but what I can tell you is similar to what I said in the first quarter. We saw a lot of growth in the energy space in particular and, more narrowly, interest in oil markets, which is not surprising if you look at what's happening. There's a lot of growth in the world in oil, a lot of new sources of oil, a lot of discussion around the oil markets, and so that's an area where we've seen a significant growth in the number of customers.","And then the other thing I mentioned earlier is it's not just an interest in the data, but we're seeing more customers grow. I forget what the number was, but I think we were up something like 30% in terms of people who are buying access to our exchanges. And so, it's growth in data consumption in energy, it's growth in connectivity in energy, and then, as Jeff alluded to, there's a lot of valuable information at the New York Stock Exchange as well, and we continue to see more customers who are interested in consuming that data. So it's across the business.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Great. And then just on M&A and your kind of outlook today versus other periods, how much time you guys are thinking you're spending on potential acquisitions and how you would characterize the environment today for potential activity?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, there's definitely a lot of opportunities available for M&A in the market. We see it \u2013 similarly, there's a lot of private equity firms that are coming to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and some of those companies are not really ready for listing and those private equity firms have been looking to sell them privately. So we see activity on both sides.","Nothing has changed for us. We are driven by return on invested capital metrics and where we can place our money so that it has the highest return for shareholders, as part of that graph that we have shown, which is we like to buy businesses, not to own them but where we think we can transform them because of the unique nature of the network we've put together. And so they become high value, high return on invested capital businesses for us, so we'll always look at things like that, but we weigh them against the other opportunities we have in the way we can return capital to shareholders or reinvest in organic growth. And I would say nothing has changed other than it does seem like there's a lot of private equity-based companies around that are looking for new owners both in the public and private markets.","Scott A. Hill - Chief Financial Officer","And just extending that point, in the first slide in the appendix we do put out each quarter what our return on invested capital is. And as I said, I thought we'd be by the end of the year, we're now back at 8% and it's above our cost of capital. So just to build on Jeff's point, we do focus on return on invested capital as we think about investments, as we think about synergies in the businesses we buy and the integration plans for those acquisitions. I think that's an important milestone. The ROIC for our company remains above that of our closer competitors, and more importantly it's back above cost of capital which means every day we come to work we're creating value for shareholders.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Just wanted to ask quickly about the \u2013 I don't think you mentioned, the Russell-FTSE agreement that CME just struck, and maybe also give a little bit of history there. I remember when you've taken this over you were very excited, I think you paid a pretty big price for it to get that over and it never took off. So maybe just what happened? Why did it never become a big area for you? Why did you not get more competitive in keeping this contract? And what's the profitability or impact when that is going to CME in the future?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. So let me answer the second part first, which is the move away from us is immaterial to us. And the reason that that happened is really the first part of your question, which is what we found in marketing the Russell complex was that the natural hedging user, which is always our target customer, is a large institutional buyside or smaller \u2013 medium institutional buyside that has a mid-cap or small-cap U.S. portfolio that wants to hedge that. What we found is very strong competition from our competitor who was marketing to that same asset base, the use of the S&P 500 as the hedging instrument. And the Russell indices and the S&P 500 had become very highly correlated, and so there was very robust competition.","The deal we struck had the cost of that marketing borne by us and over time we had been putting in more and more market making programs and other incentives to try to attract liquidity that was lowering our rate per contract and lowering the take that ICE got out of that deal. And so, it is now moving to that competitor, it's going into a vertical, it's going to be exclusive and basically the market's going to be carved up by the index providers and their distributor on those economics. We understand why they would want to do that. It's not material, the loss is not material to us.","The thing we find incongruous, however, is claims that somehow that that is pro-competition or somehow this is open access, when in reality it's exactly the opposite. It's a market carve up putting all those in one place and have the economics split between people. A similar thing has happened with respect to the equity side of the Russell business which has moved exclusively recently to CBOE. Again, CBOE being a person that \u2013 an equity options exchange that puts out unique content, has been very successful in its unique content. And a decision made to put all that together in a vertical and carve up the economics.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Great. And then, maybe secondly, for Scott, I guess, capital returns have come up a few times already, but if I just look at your buybacks here, around $200 million per quarter over the last three quarters. Absent any other things I think is that a good range to think about for now? And then in general how do you feel about, again, absent any sort of M&A, adding more leverage to balance sheet, any recent discussions with the ratings agencies? I know you're just getting to know them still, but how do you feel about leverage in general?","Scott A. Hill - Chief Financial Officer","As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our leverage target is still 1.5 times. I think that's where \u2013 we'll need to be around that in order to maintain the current rating we have, which is important to us as clearing house operators. I also mentioned that we will maintain about a $500 million cash balance. After that it's our intention, as I said in our prepared remarks, is to continue to return cash to shareholders as we have been doing.","If you look, I think it was slide 15 in the deck, we've already returned almost $600 million this year, that's versus around $900 million for the full-year last year. We've, as you mentioned, been very consistent in buying back our shares because I think it clearly expresses the view that we think that is the best investment and the best use of our capital and we've grown our dividend.","So I think what you should continue to expect is other than CapEx and to the extent we find M&A that generates higher return on invested capital, we're going to continue to deploy our cash strongly towards share repurchases and dividends.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, folks. Scott, maybe if you could, just talk a little bit more about the expense outlook trajectory as we move into the fourth quarter. I think you said last quarter that the expenses could trend \u2013 that trajectory could trend down into the fourth quarter and then as we move into the first quarter 2016. I think a couple of quarters ago you gave guidance on the expense synergy realization road map and obviously, I think you're tracking ahead of that. So just maybe an update on, I think the $450 million of annualized expense synergies that you thought you'd be at a run rate basis in 1Q 2016, if you think you might be ahead of that, and maybe what is that number as of 2Q, as of this quarter?","Scott A. Hill - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I think what's really important is to focus on our overall expense trajectory and the margin expansion that you're seeing. We're three years removed almost from announcing the deal, almost two years removed from closing the deal. In the intervening period of the time, we bought four new businesses, we've invested in growing organically our internal businesses. So we're really very focused on our overall expense trajectory. Inside that, we are well on track towards our synergy objectives. As I said in the quarter, you mentioned that it was going to decelerate over the course of the year, but synergies actually accelerated into the second quarter, and so if you look at the guidance relatively, we're now at or likely, slightly below our full-year guidance. If you'd taken the mid-point of our original guidance, it was down 3%. We're now down 4%, and that's against the backdrop of growing revenues.","The other thing, I think, that's important is we just don't manage expenses through synergies. We manage expenses across all of our businesses. And so as we move forward, we're going to be really focused on what is the net trajectory of our overall expenses. We expect those expenses to continue to improve, which will allow margins to continue to expand. And I think the real visibility to our progress is going to be found in the margin expansion, which, as I mentioned, in the quarter, 6 points up year-to-year to 59%; right on track, frankly, to where we thought we'd be a couple years ago.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Yeah, I know, it sounds like that trajectory would have you at a lower overall expense rate as we get into the fourth quarter and particularly given the projects that you're working on for NYSE with the margins over 50% for the NYSE business. Is that fairly accurate?","Scott A. Hill - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Again, I think we gave pretty clear guidance on where we thought third quarter and fourth quarter would be. I definitely think the trends are positive because embedded in that guidance, frankly, are investments to enable, as Jeff said earlier, improvements in our compliance functions and the efficiency of that organization. It's investments that are necessary to integrate our SuperDerivatives acquisition, our Holland Clearing House acquisition, so despite those investments, which are reflected in the third quarter and fourth quarter guidance, the expenses will be down year-to-year. And then once those investments are made, we'll realize the benefit of them as we move into 2016.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks. And then maybe just back on the market data, it sounds like you've got great traction in the core businesses. If you can, comment about SuperDerivatives a little bit and the ICE Benchmark Administration from a revenue contribution? Is that \u2013 were they not as bigger growth contributors in the second quarter? And then as we move into 2016, do you expect them, both of them to become much more meaningful in that growth trajectory?","Scott A. Hill - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So we gave guidance at the beginning of the year that I think was we expected our acquisition to be $50 million to $55 million in revenues. And that was largely SuperDerivatives and that was incremental revenue. And I think we're largely right on track to that. And what I would suggest to you is that's not inconsistent with their prior year performance. I do expect as we move into 2016 that that business can grow for us, because what we're doing right now is we're really integrating it, we're leveraging their resources to help us build out our clearing offerings. And so, I think as we get that business more integrated, invest in resources to expand it, it will certainly contribute to growth as it moves into 2016. So, I'd characterize SuperDerivatives as pretty much on track to what we thought it would be this year and definitely a growth opportunity in the next year.","And look, ICE Benchmark Administration is still a relatively new business. We've just recently kicked off the Gold Fix, the ICE swap rate is still relatively new. And so I definitely do that business \u2013 it's certainly already contributing this year, but I do think it's a business that can grow next year and we're making significant investments in that business to help it grow as we move into the future.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Great. Good morning, everybody. The question for you guys on just what's been, kind of, going on in the oil markets more recently, specifically curious if you could give us a little more color on any changes in, kind of, participation or client behavior we saw this time around with the slide in July versus what was happening at the end of the last year; producers versus consumers versus, kind of, financial folks, who's been more or less active on that front? Thanks.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, it's interesting, well I think the major trend that you'll see is that open interest is moved higher and is up at record levels and so there is a lot of interest in those markets. I think a lot of lay people think, oh, if the price is going down then nobody is interested in using it for hedging, but the reality is people that buy oil want to try to buy it at a low price and lock in low prices. And so these are two-sided markets and there's always one side that's interested in whatever the trend is, up or down, and that's how ultimately we would make a market.","So, we still are very focused on commercial users. You'll see in the commitment of trader reports that we file publicly that we continue to see very, very strong commercial interest in the oil markets. We have a large \u2013 we talk a lot about Brent because it's our flagship and it's now become a regulated benchmark, and has become a global benchmark. But, we have many, many other oil products, including gasoil. Gasoil, you may recall, we changed the specifications to make it closer to diesel fuel. And we also changed the settlement date on that. And so we had a lot of movement around gasoil. And that happened over the last 18 months or so. That's all in place now and what you're seeing is volumes of gasoil trading have also been rising now that that contract has landed on its ultimate design. So, we feel pretty good about that business from all of, long-term, from all of those trends that we're seeing.","Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got you. And then, Scott, just one for you, on the 100% retention of NYSE Amex, I'm not sure if I missed it, but what does that mean for the kind of operating results of the company on kind of whole pre-tax basis?","Scott A. Hill - Chief Financial Officer","We haven't disclosed what the dollar amounts are. I don't want to be trite and tell you it means we get to keep 100% of it, but that's really effectively, we've moved from getting 84% to 100%. It's not, in the scheme of things, it's not a huge amount. For that business, it's important, because what we've seen, you've seen us walk away from volumes that aren't helping to deliver profit to the bottom-line. There has been some impacts around some of those volumes as we worked our way through that Amex partnership. I think now what you saw in the first quarter and in the second quarter you see it even more clearly share seems to have stabilized, it was actually a little bit better in July versus what we saw in the second quarter. So, generally, with that business, what we're seeing is stable share, relatively stable rate capture, and as we've bought back that profit, an improving profitability to the business overall.","Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Ken Worthington, with JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Okay. I think this is question six on data, so I apologize. But, as we think about growing data revenue and earnings going forward, how you are thinking about the opportunity of growing the business that goes beyond ICE's proprietary data? You've got LIBOR, Gold Fix, I guess SuperDerivatives is in there as well. What are really the next steps for growth beyond ICE's own data?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, first of all, I think maybe implicit in your question is the notion that our data is the data that is the obvious data, which is the output of trading. But, the other thing that we believe that we have that is unique content that has yet to have been developed. Because of our broad relationship with a lot of companies and the way we touch them, there is a lot of, let's say, non-trade data that we collect through the various ways we touch our customers than can be organized up and potentially have value back into the market.","And we are building through the team that we have at SuperDerivatives more predictive capabilities and analytical capabilities to take all of that rich dataset and put it into context. And we think that would, sort of, be the next leg up. Couple that with the fact that we made a decision, we didn't talk a lot about it at the time but we made a decision when we spun off a lot of the NYSE technology businesses to actually keep the network that's called Safety so that we have better distribution into our client base, and more importantly in a world where people are concerned about security, and we are hyper-concerned about security, we think that the trends on the way data is delivered are going to move towards very, very highly secured relationships between us and our customers and we've got this great infrastructure to do that.","So, all of those are more than just selling the trade data, the exhaust that comes out of it; exchanges and all of the things that I mentioned as growth opportunities are quite high value and there are things that when we talked to customers increasingly they are telling us that they are willing to pay for those.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Perfect. And just lastly, China is topical today. I think both CME and Virtu had some sort of disclosure or announcement. Updated thoughts in terms of tapping China, you've got Singapore launching next quarter. I think initially you were going to do lookalike contracts. Have you, kind of, circled back on the China strategy? And if so, what are your thoughts today?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","First of all we do have an FX franchise and we have the dollar index and I would just mention that RMB is not a part of the dollar index. It's been a conversation we've had for a couple years, but \u2013 so, with respect to FX it's had no real impact on us. That's China FX that has no real impact on us.","Our China strategy is we want to open an exchange and clearing house in Singapore. Honestly, we don't have a \u2013 it is a very hard nut to crack in financial services. The government there has made it very clear that they're going to control access to markets in and out, and so what we want to do is be positioned in the region. And having \u2013 we are in constant dialogs over there. We have an office in China and colleagues that are working on improving our position every day, but it is a difficult area to penetrate in the financial services space and personally I understand why that is and don't begrudge their government for wanting to have controls over that as they move their population into the middle-class.","So in any event, long story short, this Singapore launch for us is strategic and important.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes the question-and-answer session. So, at this time, I would like to turn the call back over to management for any closing comments.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thank you, Keith, and thank you all for joining us on the call. We'll continue to report on our future results in future calls like this. And have a good day.","Operator","Thank you. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kelly Loeffler. Please go ahead.","Kelly Loeffler - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Good morning. ICE's third quarter 2016 earnings release and presentation can be found on the Investors section of theice.com. These items will be archived, and our call will be available for replay.","Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2015 Form 10-K.","In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including adjusted income, operating margin, expenses, EPS, debt-to-EBITDA, and tax rate. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance.","In the appendix of our presentation and earnings press release, you'll find a summary of our GAAP results, a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP terms, and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful, as well as how management uses these measures. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses, and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share.","Unless otherwise noted, the year-over-year figures we will discuss reflect comparisons against adjusted pro forma 2015 results.","With us on the call are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Chuck Vice, President and Chief Operating Officer.","I'll now turn the call over to Scott.","Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Thank you, Kelly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our today. I'll begin on slide four and cover our results through the first nine months of 2016.","Consolidated net revenues grew 4% to $3.4 billion, with trading and clearing revenues up 2% and data and listings revenues up 6% versus the prior year.","In addition, operating margins expanded 4 points to 57% and expected 2016 synergies have increased over 50% to $115 million. All of these factors enabled adjusted earnings to grow 10% versus 2015 pro forma results.","This strong financial performance also generated record operating cash flow of $1.5 billion through September. This strong cash generation enabled us to reduce our leverage, grow our dividend and in October, to restart our share repurchase program.","We are executing a well designed strategic plan, are efficiently integrating our acquired businesses, and are delivering top and bottom line growth, strong cash generation and improving ROIC and capital return, all less than a year after closing our acquisition of Interactive Data.","Now let's turn to slide five, where I'll walk you through our results for the third quarter. Revenues in the quarter were up slightly over the prior year. Adjusted operating expenses declined 3% year-over-year and margins expanded to 55%. Adjusted operating income increased 4% year-to-year and adjusted earnings per share were $3.21. Of note, you'll see that our third quarter tax rate was roughly 30%. We currently expect a similar rate for the fourth quarter.","Moving next to slide six, I'll provide some additional details about our third quarter revenues. While our total revenues were roughly flat, our data and listings segment revenue grew 5% year-over-year, and represented 55% of our consolidated revenue for the quarter.","Within the data and listings segment, our exchange data was up 17% year-over-year. Pricing and analytics revenue would have grown 3% excluding the weakness in the pound and the impact of a large customer true-up that occurred in the prior third quarter.","Our data revenues remain on track to grow between 6% and 7% for the full year 2016 and the outlook is favorable for at least a similar level of growth in 2017.","Our trading and clearing revenues declined 4% versus the prior year as lower volatility and the precipitous fall in the pound created a significant headwind. Within the trading and clearing segment, though, commodities revenue grew 2%, including energy revenues, which grew 4% year-to-year.","Oil and natural gas were both strong contributors and continued to grow in October. Despite continued growth in our OTC clearing business, financials revenues declined 14%, including interest rate revenues which were down 15%. Interest rate futures volume grew 13% in the quarter, but revenues were significantly impacted by the weaker pound.","We expect to publish our October volumes on Wednesday, and despite continued currency impacts and lower volatility in equity, we preliminarily expect to report solid results including; oil volumes up around 10% and interest rate volumes growing more than 50% versus the prior year.","The increased volumes, stable to improving open interest levels and continued growth in exchange data customers \u2013 interest in the markets we operate remains high.","Now let's flip to slide seven, where I'll discuss our expense performance and provide updated guidance. Third quarter adjusted operating expenses declined 3% year-over-year to $484 million, and pro forma operating margin expanded by 2 points.","Importantly, please also note on the right side of the slide that margins expanded in both our business segments. As we continue to integrate our acquisitions and streamline our operations, we are realizing Interactive Data synergies on an accelerated basis.","We now expect to achieve around $115 million in synergies for 2016. Increased synergies and the weaker pound enabled us to maintain our full year adjusted expense guidance despite the addition of expenses related to the Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis acquisitions.","For the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted expenses in the range of $500 million to $505 million with the quarter-to-quarter increase due largely to the addition of these recently acquired businesses.","Our final full year 2016 expense guidance reflects a reduction of nearly 3% versus 2015 and a $75 million improvement from our guidance at the beginning of the year. This improvement benefited from roughly $35 million largely related to the impact of the lower pound, but, more importantly, reflects an additional $40 million in synergies realized during 2016.","I'll conclude my prepared remarks on slide eight with a review of our cash generation, deleveraging and capital returns.","We generated record operating cash flows of $1.5 billion in the first nine months of the year and deployed that cash to invest around $250 million in CapEx, to reduce our debt by $1 billion and to return over $300 million to shareholders through dividends.","We reduced our leverage from 2.8 times at the end of 2015 to 2.3 times at the end of September. Importantly, we remain on track to reduce leverage below 2 times during 2017, which allowed us to restart our share repurchase program in October and will support our objective to grow our dividend as we grow.","We remain confident that our solid cash generation will continue to support our strong investment-grade rating, enable additional strategic investment and allow us to increase our capital returns to shareholders.","Our results for the first nine months of this year reflect our commitment to execution, innovation and value creation for our shareholders. We deliver on this commitment by expanding our footprint to meet the ever-changing needs of our customers in a very dynamic time in our industry.","I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Thank you, Scott, and good morning to everyone on the call. This morning, I'll take a few minutes to update you on key areas of investor interest and then we'll conduct the question-and-answer session.","I'll start with the topic of consistent long-term growth on slide nine. Our 10-fold revenue growth over the last decade, including revenue that doubled and earnings that have tripled in the last three years, is driven by expanding the range of ways we serve our customers around the world. This growth continues, with total futures volume up 20% in the month of October, alongside an expanding data business that is meeting the secular demand for more information.","As a start-up company, we gained a foothold by electronifying trade execution. This market transparency and product standardization then drove demand for clearing to serve the growing need for risk management. And today, as capital and operational efficiencies become paramount, our customers require more of our proprietary information to support risk management, trading, and investment management.","Our services continue to evolve with changes in the market, which creates shareholder value by anticipating and capitalizing on change. As the most global exchange operator, with over 40% of our total revenues derived outside the U.S., we're moving quickly to leverage our scalable technology infrastructure across North America, Europe, and Asia.","In an ever-fragmenting marketplace, we're providing the consistent tools, technology and data sources that customers require in order to stitch together the big picture on an enterprise scale. As a result, we're benefiting from balanced geographic, product, and customer diversification. And because we're not levered to any one cyclical trend or geography, we've led our space in growth on virtually every metric over the last decade.","On slide 10, I'll highlight the strategy behind our balanced approach, driven by a virtuous cycle across our global markets, clearing houses, data and listings.","Transaction-based revenue can be cyclical, but market participants always require information to make good risk management decisions. This is why we're establishing a new approach for market data for our customers who've told us that they're looking for flexible and efficient ways to receive and respond to information. Our investments in technology that help scale our infrastructure are allowing us to serve customers on an increasingly integrated platform.","Following the financial crisis, many new opportunities to provide valuable services have emerged. Whether it's increased compliance, the move to independent pricing, demand for information security, algorithmic trading or the trend toward passive investing, each of these drives increasing demand for data.","These dynamics have only begun to play out. An example is last month's SEC ruling on liquidity, which will require the measuring and reporting of liquidity risk by certain ETFs and mutual funds. Our Liquidity Indicators product is developed specifically to meet the reporting requirements in the U.S. and Europe, particularly as both the SEC and MiFID rules come into effect.","To further build on our capabilities, we completed the acquisition of S&P's Security (sic) [Securities] Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis. These assets add to our portfolio of unique information that spans virtually all asset classes and provides workflow support for the front, middle and back offices. And having increased our capabilities for expanded bond price evaluations, we're developing new types of fixed income indices for institutional investors, as a complement to our Treasury Indices. We'll have more details on this in the coming weeks.","We're rapidly integrating the former Interactive Data, SuperDerivatives, NYSE Index operations and ICE's exchange data to form the comprehensive global ICE Data Services organization.","In the third quarter, we also completed the integration of the safety connectivity business with our 7ticks network to be in a position to offer an expanded range of service. We're focused on leveraging our broad product and client service platform to drive efficiencies for both our customers and for our company. We believe we're in the early stages of bringing our complete and flexible enterprise data solution to bear and we'll continue to update you as we build out an integrated data platform.","The other component of this segment is our listings business. And while the IPO environment continues to be muted, we had a record quarter for revenue. Since ICE's acquisition of NYSE Euronext, we've listed 18 out of the 20 IPOs that raised $1 billion or more, including the largest IPO in 2016 with the listing of ZTO last week.","As we always do, we're also curating our business lines to stay focused on our core capabilities. So we've decided to sell a company known as IDMS that came to us as part of our acquisition of Interactive Data. This business provides services to wealth management firms. We have also decided to sell NYSE Governance Services, which operates in the governance, risk and compliance space. While good businesses in their own right, they don't meaningfully leverage ICE's core competencies or have our strong margin growth profile and so we believe that they'll be more valuable to others within their core sectors.","ICE's recurring revenue grew to over 55% of our total revenue in the third quarter, compared to just 38% in the prior third quarter. Today, the majority of our revenue is ratable and subscription-based, which allows greater visibility into cash flow generation and which provides balance to the cyclicality of the transaction segment. This also leads to less volatile earnings and more consistent cash flow, which we believe is a higher value business.","On the other side of our revenue equation is highlighted on slide 11, where you can see the ongoing strength in our transaction and clearing segment, with revenues up 2% in the first nine months. In the third quarter, volume, again, grew year-to-year in energy, agriculture, metals, interest rate and MSCI indexes. Notably, year-to-date through October the volume in our European interest rate futures complex is up 17%, and surprising to many, is growing three times as fast as the U.S. interest rate futures complex traded elsewhere, even with all the speculation surrounding a potential Fed rate hike. Importantly, volume in many of our benchmark contracts are up double-digits year-to-date, including ICE Brent Crude, our agriculture complex, sterling, Euribor and our MSCI futures contracts.","We also set records in our emerging contracts, such as the ICE Ares pound denominated LIBOR future. This is the first sterling denominated interest rate swap future to trade and clear on an exchange. And you can also see the solid trends in open interest, even amid a less volatile third quarter, as market participants kept their positions open heading into year-end. And we continue to grow our lead in our share of crude oil open interest.","We believe that our continued growth is driven by the global relevance of our products and their exposure to the numerous international factors that are driving markets today. So I'm pleased to note that ICE Clear Europe and ICE Clear Credit both received their EMIR compliance recognition from ESMA during the third quarter. And yesterday, ICE Futures Europe received the CFTC's approval for its Foreign Board of Trade application. These are just a few examples of how the U.S., the UK and the EU have worked together to utilize equivalents rather than passporting to manage cross-border international regulatory frameworks.","Our drive to grow and evolve has produced consistent growth throughout market cycles and anyone that's followed the financial markets for a few years knows that there is continuous change going on. One of those drivers of change and driver of opportunity is Brexit. The UK remains an important global market center with prudent regulation, a focus on ensuring market confidence and a strong financial services talent pool. We're maintaining an active dialog with officials in the UK government to help preserve the role of markets in London's futures. We're encouraged by the practical approach that the UK government is taking to carefully consider the future opportunities as an independent country.","And similarly, we do not believe that financial market infrastructure leaving London is in the best interest of Europe's markets. Many have questioned whether we might bid for the London Stock Exchange, an opportunity that we called off earlier this year in the absence of sufficient information to establish the value of a bid coupled with our concerns about the effects on the company of a Brexit vote.","Because this important asset could be leaving the city of London, we believe that this may create new opportunities for us as a leading infrastructure provider as we see the ability to continue to invest in the UK. For example, in December of last year, we invested in the London based Trayport, an operator of important technology that serves the European commercial energy markets.","Recently, the CMA issued a finding that ICE-owning Trayport would have an adverse impact on competition in the European utility derivatives trading and clearing markets. And that we should therefore divest the Trayport.","ICE and Trayport are not competitors, which the CMA recognized. So our acquisition of Trayport does not involve a loss of competition under a so-called horizontal theory of harm. The CMA's decision relied on a simplistic assessment of market dynamics rather than a rigorous quantitative analysis. And it also relied largely on the views of conflicted third parties that have a competitive interest in the outcome of their review.","ICE produced a detailed analysis to demonstrate that we would not and could not operate Trayport in a way that impairs access. We also offered far-reaching operational and governance remedies to address CMA's theoretical concerns. So we believe that CMA's decision under such a speculative and vague theory is disproportionate and it would be a terrible precedent for future merger and acquisition activities in Europe. Therefore, it's important for us that we pursue our right of appeal in connection with this pro-customer, pro-market transaction.","We're committed to continuing Trayport's operations in London. And we continue to operate the company just as we have for most of last year. Across our entire organization, our focus remains on servicing customers. And we believe that if we do the right things with our customers in mind, then we're serving our shareholders.","Let me conclude my prepared remarks on slide 12, where you can see that we continue to build on our decade long track record of growth. This year again, we've grown revenues, met or exceeded synergy expectations, reduced expenses and expanded our margins, driving 16% adjusted earnings growth in the first nine months of the year. We've generated over $1.5 billion in cash flow, repaid $1 billion in debt, grew our dividend, restarted our share repurchase program, and finalized our stock split, which will occur later this week. And we're already engaged in planning for a very productive 2017.","And so I'd like to thank our customers for their business in the quarter and I'd also like to thank our team for their continued efforts in meeting our growth objectives.","I'll now turn the call back to the operator, Allison, and we'll be glad to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. . And our first question will come from Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Yeah. Good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Scott.","Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Good morning.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Good morning.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","I guess, first question is for Scott, on the expenses, and I'm looking at slide seven, and we've talked \u2013 you made the point about increasing the synergies related to IDC. And I'm just trying to reconcile the expenses for the data and listings segment, looks flat year-over-year, and reconcile that with the expenses that \u2013 the synergies that you're taking out, just trying to see why we're not seeing it. Is it acquisition related or investments, et cetera?","Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yeah. Good question, Rich. So there are a couple of factors that are at play. Number one, recall that at the beginning of the year when we talked about the synergies, we also mentioned that we'd have about a $45 million increase in compensation and that we'd be making about $30 million of investment in our products and technology. A lot of that product investment is resulting in deals like the Index deals that we're announcing in the data space, the continuous evaluative product that we've announced in that space. So there are investments there. Clearly, a portion of the compensation go to our data team who have more than earned it in the outstanding execution that they've had this year. The other thing that you see very clearly on the chart is we've had some M&A spending in the year that tipped the data space. As you might imagine, a lot of that's been around the Trayport deal.","And then the last thing I'd note is a number of the synergies come through our corporate functions in the first year of any deal and those corporate expenses tend to get allocated to the segments based on revenue, because \u2013 an account that supports the company, they don't support data versus trading. And so you actually do see some of the synergies even though they're related to IDC showing up in the trading segment, just because of the way that we allocate. So, I think if you take a step back, we've laid out a pretty clear view of $115 million of synergies in the quarter, but that hopefully helps a little bit on the dynamic that you're asking about.","One thing, though, I'd point out in that same area of chart seven, we've disclosed our operating margins for each of the segments. And I think that's an important story that a lot of people are missing. If you look at our aggregate margins and kind of compare that to a diverse basket of competitors, I'm not sure you get the same view you do when you look at margins in the trading segment that are 50% in the quarter and 51% year-to-date, compare those to other data companies that we compete with and then look at the trading margins, which include the New York Stock Exchange and are 61% in the quarter and 64% year-to-date. And again, compare those to our exchange competitors that we deal with.","So, hopefully that helps with your direct question, but I think that area of the chart you're looking at is one I'd point a lot of investors to, because I think there's an important story that's being missed.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Understood. It's very helpful. And, Jeff, one follow-up. You do a great job at highlighting the trends and demands in market data. And I'd say the theme or I felt like the theme last quarter was fragmentation drives increased demand for data. I guess the question relates to, you're starting to see at least in, say, one asset class, but some \u2013 a little drum beat of pushback from some of the \u2013 like market makers, et cetera, pushing back on the increased pricing for market data. So I guess the question is, how do you balance that? Is that just one asset class and are the trends that you're talking about just overwhelm sort of this pushback from some market participants?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","I think that is the answer, yes. But just to give it some context, it's always interesting to us that a lot of the people that try to benefit from fragmentation of markets then complain about the fact that it costs them more to do business in that fragmentation that they helped create. And that is what's going on. You look at where you've seen just fragmentation in the past couple of years with new entrants in the energy futures space, new entrants in the European interest rate space and look at growth of our complex in those spaces, our trading volumes have grown and our data sales in those areas have grown.","In other words, this fragmentation causes arbitrage between markets. It's less easy for people to figure out where the market is at any moment in time. It's much more difficult to create a settlement price for marketing books. There's much more load, if you will, on the middle and back office for compliance, best execution and so on and so forth. All of that trend is driving demand for increased information.","One point that that group that is spending more and more on data doesn't recognize is that the actual cost of data is plummeting. There is just the fact that people are buying more lower cost, declining cost information. And so the spend for many of these people is voluntary. It is because they want a holistic view of the market and they voluntarily are going out and having to buy more and more information, even though on a per unit basis, information prices have been collapsing over the last decade.","So, we think the total wallet, if you will, is going to continue to increase. Regulatory pressures, back office compliance pressures, reporting pressures, things that all of us in a more regulated financial service industry are going to have to adjust to and pay for. Yes, it's expensive. Yes, it wasn't something that we had to do before. It's affecting our firm as well. But it is an irreversible trend in my mind. We still have a lot of regulation to come in to impact in Europe, MiFID for example, the differences that may come out of the EU and the UK with the actual Brexit separation. So, I would expect that that trend is going to continue.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Understood. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from Michael Carrier from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thanks a lot. Hey, Scott, maybe just one question on the fourth quarter, just on the expense guidance. You mentioned some of the driver was related to, I think it was some small M&A activity you had, Securities Evaluations and the Credit Market Analysis. I was just wondering, because those are relatively small, can you give us any color on maybe the revenue contribution from those transactions, just because I feel like we might have like the expense number guidance, but we don't have anything on the revenue side.","Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yeah, I appreciate the question. So the increase to $500 million to $505 million in the quarter is almost solely due to those two acquisitions. And so, if you kind of back out, call it $15 million, the guidance range would have been $485 million to $490 million, which is right where we've been on average every quarter this year. And so relatively flat on a quarter-to-quarter basis.","In terms of revenue, you will likely recall that I mentioned last quarter, we'd see a slight deceleration into the third quarter and then a reacceleration into the fourth, where we would approach $500 million of data revenue. That was at a time where the pound was still around 131. It's now closer to 122. And so that outlook softened a little bit.","So on an apples-to-apples basis versus maybe the high $490 millions, we'd be looking at something closer to the low to mid $490 millions. That notwithstanding, I actually think data revenues in the quarter including the two acquisitions will be north of $515 million. And so those expenses that I mentioned in the earnings script will be more than offset by revenues, and then obviously that adds to our overall data business and gives us an opportunity as we combine those two companies over time.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then, Jeff, just on the M&A side, so you mentioned, I guess, the issues with Trayport or the process of going through the \u2013 basically revisiting it and giving your side of the outlook. And then on LSE, it just sounded like based on your commentary on the outlook that there could be potential opportunities if certain firms do less in the UK. So I just wanted to get your updated view on the M&A opportunities in the space and particularly given maybe some of the regulatory hurdles versus what you guys can continue to do on paying down debt, buybacks, just going forward?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","It's a very good question. I mean, holistically when we look around at our space, we really see that there's one company that stands out, which would be a great acquisition, which is our own stock. And so, Scott moved very quickly to get back into the market and on this call announced that he's actually in the market now, that we've started our share repurchase program.","If you look at the futures space globally, it's relatively flat year-to-date on volumes. If you look at the -- a lot of the other trading and clearing spaces, they're down substantially. But, yet our company is actually growing. And you couple that with this new segment that we have, our largest segment, which is really growing, in the trading and \u2013 excuse me, in the data and connectivity space. Scott mentioned in his prepared remarks that we see next year the growth we can \u2013 we have visibility because we're signing contracts right now that extend well into next year and beyond for many. We have visibility into the growth of our data business. And so we think the peg ratio of our stock is just off relative to our peers. And so that's been our focus and that's why Scott decided to disclose that we actually got in the market earlier than what I think a lot of people suggested.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question will come from Ken Hill of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys.","Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Good morning.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Good morning.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So you guys announced some enhancements to NYSE Connect for listed companies in September. I think there were some additional ones in October. And this seems to be aimed at some of your Investor Relations teams, finance teams. I was hoping you could walk through that offering because it seems like it's an area of focus for some of your competitors as well. So, what should we really expect here and then what kind of maybe additional investment might you need to do there, or any potential acquisitions that look interesting?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Sure. It's a very good question. So, first of all, NYSE has -- when we acquired the business, had a desktop that it provided to corporate treasurers and CFOs. It also has some communications tools that it uses to talk to listed companies so that listed companies can provide updates on various corporate actions and what have you as a requirement they have to the exchange.","We decided to replace that infrastructure with NYSE Connect, which is what we talked about. It's basically a desktop and provides trading information. We've been building that out in a space where when we look at the space, and particularly, following up on earlier questions, there is pressure on some of the spend to lower the price of desktops particularly, and that area of data acquisition, the desktop delivery is under a lot of pressure. So having a very low cost desktop that we can provide to people to give them the basic information they need around debt and equities has been very, very well received.","So, in a sense, we're a disrupter in providing such a thing. As you can imagine, we have very good data about where stocks are trading, given that we own the NYSE. And we have very good data around where bonds are trading given that we built out this fixed income platform with a number of acquisitions. And we have very good data around corporate actions for our listed companies since it's a requirement that they give that information to us.","So that's a very nice desktop that we can expand on. Right now we're just focused on our listed companies. But we'll see where life takes that offering. It has almost no cost to us in terms of incremental margins. And so, it's an interesting tool in an area where there's a lot of pressure to lower cost by our customer base.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And just for a follow-up, I think you mentioned a couple sales within your prepared remarks. Have you broken up the revenues or operating income associated with some of those businesses? Also, just wondering if, take a stab at the impact for Trayport during the quarter or how we can think about the run rate revenue expenses for that business as well?","Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","With regard to Trayport specifically?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","IDMS and... (35:55)","Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yeah. Okay. So with regard to Trayport, I think what we told you when we closed that deal, Ken, was that the revenues were around $80 million and then it had operating margin of about 50%. I will tell you that business has continued to perform well and so that those are the kind of numbers that you should have in your head.","With regards to the other two, I don't want to give a lot of detail on the call today. But suffice it to say that as we look to divest those businesses, we will give you more information. And I'll just give you the \u2013 what I think you're thinking about it, in terms of modeling it. I'm building my budget with those businesses in and then we'll extract them at the moment if we sell them and we'll give you enough information. Suffice it to say, though, Ken, they're not material in the scheme of things to overall revenues or to overall profit. And, in fact, I would tell you, to overall profit very immaterial.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. First, in your deck you forecast 6% to 7% revenue growth for data in 2016 and I think, Jeff said in your comments you expect similar growth in 2017. As part of the growth \u2013 part of that growth has been driven by higher teen growth in exchange data. Can you give us a sense of how you're thinking about that growth for 2017 and whether the very high level of that exchange data growth can stay in, say, the double digits of next year and if so, how do you get there?","Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for the question, Ken. The other thing I want to do is, I want to clarify one point just so it doesn't get misunderstood. We will have additional revenues from the two acquired businesses. We would have grown 6% to 7% without that. So it will help solidify that towards the high end of the range. We would have been at 6% this year without it. And frankly, on a constant currency basis, we would have been above 7% for data even without those acquisitions. But, directly to your question, we have had a very strong performance in our exchange data revenues this year. Jeff talked about it on the last call and this call. That's a solid mix of growth in customers and some additional value that we've captured as we've sold more data to existing customers.","As Jeff said, while there's discussion about prices going up, the price per unit if you look at it in terms of the data that's consumed for the price, that data amount has increased significantly. So a good year this year. We would expect to have a good year again in exchange data next year. I certainly don't expect it to be on par with this year, but we have, as Jeff alluded to, seen very strong sales in our pricing and valuation business, if you will, the former IDC business and that's really what is encouraging us and gives us a good solid foundation to suggest that we could be at least at the same level of growth in 2017 as 2016.","So, said differently, I would expect a bit more balanced growth among, particularly exchange data and pricing and valuations in 2017 versus 2016, which was benefited a little bit more by the exchange data.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Awesome. Thank you. And then, trailing 12 month ROIC fell to 7.8% this quarter. I have not been able to fully work through it yet. But, basically, any comments there? And then you always put in your deck set the ROIC is above your cost of capital. I notice you didn't say it that time \u2013 this time, so want to follow up there as well.","Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Sure. I think at this point, Ken, it's just implied that it is. We're the only one in the space that is consistently doing it. So just under 8% versus cost of capital just over 6%, we are generating excess return on invested capital every day we operate the business.","And again, that's unique in our space. If you look on an absolute basis, although we dipped to just below 8%, that relates to the IDC business that we haven't even owned for a year. If you looked at the trends coming out of the last year before that business, we were on our way back to 10%. We'll start to rebuild that as we move through this year and next and you'll see a similar trend.","And again, even at the current levels, compared to the people we compete with, our ROIC compares very favorably. So we'll continue to put it on the chart, which distinguishes us. It will continue to be above our cost of capital, which distinguishes us. And it will continue to be above our competitors, which distinguishes us.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Awesome. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from Kyle Voigt of KBW. Please go ahead.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. You spoke earlier, I guess, about Brent gaining share of open interest in the crude markets and we can see those same trends, but I guess, on the volume side, we have seen some share migrate back to WTI more recently. Can you just talk about the market share dynamics in the crude markets and what's going on with some of the volume shift?","And then secondly, also related to Brent, I think this time last year you had very significant growth in open interest on a year-on-year basis and I think as of yesterday, futures open interest was basically flat year-on-year in Brent specifically. So can you help us think about outlook here for growth in this contract now that we've gotten some price stability in those markets? Thanks.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Sure. So, two things are going on in our minds in the oil space. One is that WTI is really the contract that speculators use and there has been, over the last year or so, a lot of speculation about where the price of oil should go. It was $60, go down to $30, will it go back up to $50, those kinds of behaviors, particularly as the U.S. was right-sizing its drilling infrastructure and as high yield was in focus on many of the energy companies.","And so, one would naturally expect that WTI, which we also have, would have more trading in that environment. Brent is and remains the contract that most of the energy space uses for hedging. And the nice thing about that is you can see that that industry continues to use Brent.","The second trend that goes on is we have competitors that are paying for order flow. And there are people that in the trading business that if you pay them, they will produce volume. And our competitors that do that like to talk about market share and report market share and there's actually investors and analysts that reward them for getting market share, even though it's destroying value for shareholders.","We had a large customer come to us and said, hey, one of your competitors came to us and said that they would buy our business. What are they talking about? They were not talking about to us about lowering our cost. They actually said they would pay us to move. And we said, how much did they say they would pay you? And they said, we will pay you anything, name your price. And so, with that kind of behavior you will always find some people that will take up on that. It doesn't bother us that we lose that share because we are a primary market. And as you can see from data sales and just growth in our open interest and what have you, that people tend to have to rely on the primary market in order to get paid by competitors. So, overall, trading volume goes up, but our volume, which is really the volume of people that want to pay or maybe the wallet share, if you will, continues to go up for us.","And with respect to Brent, this will be, we believe, our 19 consecutive year of growth in trading of Brent. It's almost in \u2013 you put a ruler on it. It's almost an unprecedented ability when you think about everything that's gone on in the world over that 19-year period. Wars, the changes in policy, changes in regulation, financial crisis, etcetera. We continue to see Brent just -- its volume just marching forward. So we're very lucky to have that as a primary market. We are really careful custodians of it. And it's why we're not playing that game of going in and asking customers how much do you want us to pay you to do business with us.","Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Just to add a \u2013 put a couple of numbers on the points Jeff made. If you go back two years, our share of volumes is about 53%. This year it's kind of mid-40%s. But back then our share of OI was a little less than 50%. Today it's 53%.","So the OI is being built by commercial customers in our markets. And by the way, that doesn't even include our swap-to-futures products. If you add that in, in terms of, what the comprehensive oil commercials are trading, where they're hedging their risk, we are the place where those commercial customers come to trade their oil.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","That's really helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Alex Kramm of UBS. Please go ahead.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to go back to the market data discussion. I think Jeff and maybe, Scott, even as well, mentioned the incremental pressure in the customer base and people looking to reduce cost. So, I don't think that's something you've talked about so far. So, can you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in terms of the spending environment? Are sales cycles getting pushed out? Are you seeing cancellations? Are clients going out of business? And maybe more holistically, when you look at your data offering, how much of the business do you really feel like is must have like \u2013 the last thing that people turn off when they turn off a light is to close shop, and how much is more discretionary spending? Thanks.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yeah. It's great. Well, first thing I would say to you is that we see our retention rate, our renewal rate which we now have a little visibility into having owned IDC and put ICE Data Services together earlier this year, we see our retention rate is very, very high, maybe even increasing a little bit, well into the \u2013 above 90% renewal rate.","So we don't see the pressure, if you will, on those businesses. When we're out talking to customers, where we hear there's a lot of focuses on data that's delivered via a desktop, a lot of focus on the number of screens, if you will, and the acquisition of desktops, we've built the safety network and combined it with the 7ticks network to build essentially a data plant that is distributed via API and we see strong growth in people wanting to buy bulk data, if you will, via an API and manage it internally and not buy it on an individual desktop basis.","We're not really in the desktop space as I mentioned earlier. We have NYSE Connect, which is a desktop that is a very low cost desktop, and to a certain degree is becoming a substitution for the higher desktop providers, if you will.","And so I think that's the trend that's sort of mixed up here. Alex, I really believe that the middle and back office in your firm has no choice but to \u2013 for compliance purposes and for improving systems and commoditization of the way risk is being looked at inside large firms is buying that bulk data and figuring out how to redistribute it. And I think that that trend is going to continue, because we haven't really seen the full implementation of MiFID. We haven't seen what the result of a different Brexit regime, the SEC has not fully implemented Dodd-Frank. And so there's still more pressures for compliance and in internal functions that we think will drive demand.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Great. Thank you. And then maybe just secondly, on the transaction side, particularly on your futures business, I think one of the things that you don't talk about much is pricing leverage. When you look at your primary competitor in the U.S., I think for the last three, four years, every year they've given updates on pricing moves that added 2%, maybe 3%. You don't really talk about that much and I think your pricing is also way more straightforward. But, how about pricing in that business? I mean, you're talking about the relevance of your products and shouldn't you be taking a little bit more pricing over time, maybe an update on your philosophy there?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yeah. I think, generally speaking, we've benefited from keeping pricing relatively untouched and allowing volume to grow. When we think about -- going back to people that pay for order flow in order to create market share, we think about the market slightly differently. We have people that really just look at markets every day and talk to customers and try to say, do we have liquidity all the way out the forward pricing curve? Are there gaps in where people try to do business and where we have markets? And so, we'll provide incentive programs to try to fill in gaps or to make the markets better for our customers. And so, we do have incentive programs which touch pricing. But they're not to get overall market share. They're really to make a better market. And we've found that consistently we've been able to grow by having that philosophy. So, to a certain degree, we haven't touched the control panel.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, everybody.","Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Good morning.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Scott, I wanted to touch on the margin question. So when you look at the data business, you guys are doing 50%, obviously margins are up nicely since you acquired IDC. Where do you guys see the margins going over time? And I understand this is going to be a function both of the revenue growth as well as the expense synergies that are yet to come out. But bigger picture, could the profitability in that business ultimately get closer to where the transaction side of the business is?","Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yeah, look, I don't want to predict an end state, but I certainly think there is room for continued margin expansion. And that will come in two flavors as you just said. We still do have synergies that we will extract from that business. We mentioned originally $150 million. We'll do $65 million this year, well above what we thought we'd get done in the first year. But those synergies will continue to come out and improve margins.","The other thing that I've talked about a little bit that I think is really important for people to understand, the incremental margin on the proprietary data we sell is very similar to historically what you've seen incremental margins on our trading business, where it's more labor-intensive in terms of trying to determine what the price of a bond is, there are people involved with that versus oil being decided on an exchange. But once you determine that price of the bond, if I can sell it to a second customer and a third customer and a fourth customer, the incremental costs are very small. And so, revenue growth drives high incremental margins. Synergies drive margin improvements. And so I absolutely think the expectation for that business is margin expansion over time. Again, I'm not going to guess at what the end state is, but it's higher.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","And Alex, to add on to the prepared comments that I made, what ICE does really well is to use technology to build something complicated and do it one time, and then use our network to sell that thing many times. And so the businesses that I mentioned that we're going to exit and businesses that we've exited in the past when we acquired NYSE and other firms tend to be very good businesses that are growing, but they don't have the phenomenon where we can use our technology skills to build something once and our network to redistribute it.","And so, for example, we're going to sell NYSE Governance Services. That is a very hot space. It's a growing space. Companies need more infrastructure to educate employees about anti-money laundering. There is a huge demand for what they do and that company has -- is growing and has growth potential. But it doesn't have that phenomenon that I just mentioned that really we do well. So that's why we say, we think that company will be better owned by others; a good company, but one that doesn't cater to our needs. We tend to see other people in our space go into those kinds of businesses. But we just don't do well and it doesn't really work for us to be in these lower margin consultancy type businesses.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it; makes sense. And then just a quick follow-up around the capital return dynamic. You guys have talked about in the past running with probably a little bit higher leverage than you targeted in the past prior to the IDC deal. Maybe an update there? What's the debt to EBITDA ratios we should be thinking about on a go forward basis as we try to kind of think through the buyback over the next year or so?","Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Yeah, so you're right. Historically, we had talked about 1.5 times and we've more recently talked about the need to get below 2 times. And that remains the objective. We are on a path to do that. That's why we were able to get back into the market in October and take advantage of what Jeff correctly identified as the best buy in the market, in our opinion.","So, we definitely are on a path to get below 2 times. We're committed to get there. But, as I said in my prepared remarks, not only were we able to restart our buybacks in October, but we remain committed to grow our dividend as we grow. And I think with the increased cash generation that you're seeing, we're going to be north of $2 billion of operating cash flow this year, well north of probably $1.7 billion of free cash flow this year, and that should definitely allow us to get our leverage back below 2 times, to continue to ramp up our share repurchases, because we certainly aren't at the level in the fourth quarter that we would anticipate being as we move through next year, and then also to grow the dividend as we grow.","All of which would hopefully move us, in 2014 and 2015 we returned almost $1 billion a year. This year it will be between $400 million and $500 million. But I certain think as you get into 2017 and certainly 2018 and 2019, you're going to see us get back to and above the levels you saw in 2014 and 2015.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Very helpful. Thanks so much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, our next question will come from Vincent Hung of Autonomous. Please go ahead with your question.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Hi. Good morning.","Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Good morning.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Good morning.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Just on pricing in the data business, is it possible to break out the different pricing schemes in terms of how much is enterprise based pricing versus per usage versus per head? And actually as a related question, do you feel you've fully utilized the opportunity in exchange data when it comes to finding new ways to price the data, which is pricing certain data sets differently or different pricing schemes for different customers?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Well, to answer the first part of your question is it, we haven't looked at the data in the way you just described. In fact, we're \u2013 part of the exercise that's going on as we're creating ICE Data Services is just for management to figure out the metrics that we're going to use to run the business and honestly it probably won't be as detailed as you just laid out, because there's a lot of moving parts.","Particularly given the second part of your question, which is we do see the opportunity because we have a large data set that contains some commoditized data, some proprietary data, some network infrastructure and some desktop space, some indices and some calculation engines, to do sort of package deals, enterprise package deals for people and there's tremendous interest in that. People can come do those deals directly with us. They don't have to have a middleman. And we can provide a range of services.","So we've been very successful early on in the ETF\/ETP space, where there's a lot of cost pressure on those competitors and yet they need a full range of services from listing the ETF, to calculating the ETF, to having daily prices of the things that are in the ETF to creating the index for the ETF and using our brands and marketing the ETF. So those kinds of package deals don't lend themselves to some of the metrics that you just described. So I doubt that we'll ever fully get to that.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Okay. And what's the guidance on synergies for next year? And is there a figure for any cost synergies from the S&P business you acquired?","Scott A. Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","So we gave you updated guidance on the synergies for this year at $115 million. I'm very encouraged by the work that Ben Jackson and Lynn Martin have been doing on the integrated -- in a much bigger team in support of them to get that business integrated.","I think we have good visibility into where we are this year, growing visibility into where we'll be next year and on the fourth quarter earnings call in February, I will definitely give you an update on our overall synergy progress as we work to take out the remaining kind of $105 million to $110 million we have to go overall.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Jeff Sprecher for any closing remarks.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Thank you, Allison.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Ms. Kelly Loeffler. You may begin, ma'am.","Kelly L. Loeffler","Good morning. ICE's second quarter 2013 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of our website at theice.com. These items will be archived, and our call will be available for replay.","Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties.","For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our company's Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q that's been filed this morning.","Please note that the numbers discussed today refer to our adjusted operating results, which we believe are more reflective of our business performance. You'll find the non-GAAP reconciliation in the earnings release and presentation, as well as an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful and how management uses these measures.","The materials presented today reflect futures volume that has been restated to include previously cleared swap contract volume.","With us on the call are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Chuck Vice, President and Chief Operating Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Scott.","Scott A. Hill","Thank you, Kelly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll start by highlighting our record first half and second quarter results, and then hand it over to Jeff who'll talk about our strong position to capitalize on the multitude of opportunities in front of us. We'll move through our prepared remarks quickly so that we can take as many questions as possible before the market opens later this morning.","Let's start on Slide 4, with an overview of our first half performance. We continue to deliver top and bottom line growth on top of growth while introducing new products and services, making prudent investments in new initiatives and advancing our integration plans for our pending acquisition of NYSE Euronext. Thanks to the extraordinary efforts of our global clearing and technology team, the strong contribution from our Liffe colleagues and continued support from our customers, we seamlessly transferred clearing for Liffe, including over $11 billion in margin, 75 million contract sides and 43 clearing members.","We also completed our transaction to acquire a majority stake in ICE Endex, which advances our efforts in serving European natural gas and power markets, and we did all of this while delivering record revenues, along with several volume and OI records, increasing our adjusted operating margin to 63%, growing our first half earnings by 7% and delivering industry-leading returns on invested capital. We are pleased with our progress in 2013, but we remain laser-focused on the opportunities in front of us and on meeting our financial and operational objectives for 2013.","Moving to Slide 5. I'll provide some details of our second quarter performance. Revenues increased 6% year-to-year to a record $372 million. Average daily futures volumes increased 3% year-to-year. Our expense discipline resulted in a 1% decrease in adjusted operating expenses and enabled our adjusted operating margins to expand to 64%. Growth in adjusted net income attributable to ICE accelerated in the second quarter, up 12% year-to-year to a record $161 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share also grew 12% to $2.19.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was a record $232 million, and technology-related capital expenditures and capitalized software were $15 million for the quarter. We also invested $11 million to build out our new combined New York office, which completely consolidates all of our teams into single locations in Atlanta, Chicago, London and now, New York.","Please turn to Slide 6, and I'll walk you through the components of our second quarter consolidated revenues and expenses. Transaction and clearing revenue increased 4% to a record $319 million. Energy revenue grew 2% year-to-year, driven by Brent revenue growth of 6%, which resulted in record Brent revenues of $63 million. North American natural gas revenues declined 12% over the prior second quarter on continued low volatility. Ag futures revenue grew 8% year-to-year, with record quarterly revenues. And financial revenues grew 10% year-to-year, with CDS clearing revenues rising 43% to record levels. Finally, market data revenues grew 8% to $40 million.","The right side of Slide 6 provides details on our operating expense. The 1% reduction in adjusted operating expenses reflects our focus on operating a lean and efficient business model. This expense improvement drove 3 points of expansion in our adjusted operating margin to 64%, and we now expect that our full year adjusted operating expenses will grow 2% to 3% versus prior guidance of 3% to 5%. And it's worth noting that the implied growth in second half expenses is primarily a function of reductions in bonus accruals during the second half of 2012 that reflected our expectation at that time that we would come up a bit short of our financial objectives. For 2013 though, our bonus accrual reflects our current expectation that we will achieve our double-digit earnings growth objective in 2013. Our pay is directly linked to our performance.","Let's shift to Slide 7, where I'll review the second quarter performance of our futures markets. Futures revenue increased 3% over the prior second quarter on a 3% increase in average daily volume. Most of our product categories grew at a healthy rate during the quarter, with Brent, RBOB, heating oil, sugar, coffee and cocoa achieving record quarterly volumes. Natural gas average daily volume declined 13% versus the prior year, reflecting, as previously noted, a muted volatility environment in the second quarter this year versus the more volatile period in the prior year. Notably, revenue capture trends were healthy across ICE's futures market. As we noted in our volume press release on Friday, overall July volumes were down slightly. But despite the quiet summer trading season, our oil volumes grew 7% year-to-year.","Please move now to Slide 8, and I'll discuss our credit derivatives operations. Second quarter CDS revenues were $40 million. This includes $18 million from Creditex and $22 million from global CDS clearing. This is yet another quarter in which our CDS clearing revenues have surpassed our execution revenues. We believe this further validates our thesis, that clearing is a highly valued component of the services we provide. Through July, we have cleared $43 trillion in gross notional value. We offer clearing in roughly 400 instruments, and we have now cleared $1.8 trillion for our buy-side customers, far beyond our next closest competitor. Since mandatory clearing began in March, over 400 buy-side firms have signed up, with over 250 of those firms actively clearing. And as we announced last week, we expect to begin client clearing for CDS in Europe starting in October, and we continue to work as regulators to launch the clearing of western European sovereign CDS by the end of this year.","The credit derivatives execution business remains muted due to the uncertainty of how SEF rules, Dodd-Frank and Basel will impact the credit derivatives markets. However, in the U.S., SEF rules were completed in the second quarter of this year and are expected to be implemented early in the fourth quarter. And we announced yesterday that we will introduce a SEF-compliant platform for OTC derivatives market this fall called ICE Swap Trade. The platform, which was developed collaboratively with a number of leading credit market participants, will provide both central limit order book and RFQ functionality to meet the requirements of both regulators and the need of the market.","We believe the combination of ICE Swap Trade and the continued development of our CDS Index Futures products will invigorate our CDS execution business. As we expand the set of products we clear, continue to evolve trade execution and work towards the third phase of mandatory clearing in September, we believe the contribution from our CDS business will only continue to grow.","I'll wrap up my remarks on Slide 9, with a review of our cash generation, balance sheet and return on investment. In the first half, we generated $382 million of operating cash flow and held $1.5 billion in unrestricted cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong. Our leverage remains low. And we've generated industry-leading 18% returns on invested capital. We are well positioned to close the NYSE Euronext deal and quickly de-lever below 1.5x while also instituting the dividend for the first time and remaining proactive in investing in future growth opportunities.","With that, I encourage you to review the guidance we provided in the press release, and I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. Jeff, over to you.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Scott has just taken you through the record results that we've achieved year-to-date, so I'll focus on some key trends and on what's next for ICE. As we move towards the completion of our NYSE Euronext transaction, we're more confident that together we'll offer more opportunities to our customers and shareholders alike.","You can see on Slide 10, in the 13 years since our founding, ICE has expanded and transformed many times, yet we've been consistent in our focus, building and improving market infrastructure, transparency and capital efficiency for our customers. This has led to working in partnership to innovate in a way that identifies the next opportunity. While we will move forward as a larger company, our focus on customers, growth and results will not change. I know that our teams are proud of what we've achieved, but we're more excited about how our entrepreneurial culture will drive results in the future and enable us to grow as one of the world's leading exchange groups.","As you've seen throughout our history, we continue to build significant value through our selective diversification, whether across products, markets, customers or geography. This has positioned us well through cyclical downturns while we benefited from the secular trends in risk management. You may have seen stories about selected banks potentially exiting certain physical commodities businesses, but these physical commodities infrastructure resources are valuable businesses that will continue to require risk management, regardless of who owns them. Shifts in markets have occurred throughout our history, and these are the moments in which we've created opportunity. Today, our markets are largely commercially oriented, and we continue to add to our customer base. As we've demonstrated, from new product development to new clearing houses, to transitioning our swaps to futures and by listening to our customers' needs, we've expanded our markets.","Moving to Slide 11. I'd like to take a few minutes to update you on a few areas of ICE's business. We believe that the energy business, where we began, continues to offer meaningful long-term opportunities. Oil volumes remains strong despite lower volatility in Brent, and ICE Brent average daily volume reached record levels during the second quarter; so did our open interest, which is up 21% year-over-year.","ICE's WTI volume increased 16% in the second quarter, and in July, our WTI contract reached its highest market share since January 2011, as a result of the efficiency of our global energy markets. In the second quarter, WTI volume benefited from greater price volatility than did Brent, as the U.S. storage issues abated and as the Brent\/WTI spread narrowed. Expectations for the Federal Reserve potential shift in monetary policy have also likely contributed to WTI prices increasing about 15% year-to-date. This compares with the 1% increase in the price of Brent.","With over 110 commercial traders reporting in the weekly Commitment of Traders report for ICE Brent and just 5 commercial traders for our nearest competitor's contract, you can see why ICE retained 97% of the open interest in Brent Crude futures and 100% of Brent futures revenues. And despite the narrowing of Brent\/WTI to its lowest level in a few years, our competitors' payment for -- trading program, ICE's share of global crude oil futures volume has remained well above 50%.","In addition, ICE's other oil products grew average daily volume 24% year-to-year, including European and Asian oil products, which, until a few years ago, were uncleared.","Turning to our North American natural gas markets. Volume trends have been muted due to low volatility. While first half average daily volume declined 20% compared to record volumes of last year's first half, our Henry Hub contract did set an open interest record in April after several volume and OI records in the first quarter. We continue to see solid liquidity and participation, but lower levels of volatility. Nevertheless, there have been periodic price moves this year, demonstrating how managing risk is important at all price levels.","On Slide 12, I'll note a few additional areas of our ongoing focus. Following on from the strength of our crude oil futures, I want to highlight the significant growth in our RBOB Gasoline and heating oil futures, which are contracts launched following our successful WTI introduction. Combined with ICE's gas oil futures, we've grown from 65% market share in the global middle distillate market to 72% in the last 18 months. So you can see that ICE's oil volumes and revenues continue to grow, driven by demand across our crude and refined oil complexes.","Last fall, we transitioned our cleared OTC markets to futures, listed as ICE Futures U.S. or ICE Futures Europe. We continue to transform our remaining global OTC energy markets with the implementation of SEF and MTF rules. Our oil products for the European and Asian markets will ultimately move to our multilateral trading facility in Europe, and in the United States, we'll replicate our contractual relationships with thousands of OTC participants at our new SEF, which Scott mentioned called ICE Swap Trade. As a result, roughly 1,800 companies will have instant access to all swap markets and asset classes listed on ICE's SEF. Our North American physical OTC market for buying and selling natural gas, electric power and natural gas liquids will remain unchanged, and we will continue to operate them via our U.S. OTC energy subsidiaries.","Turning to our agricultural markets. ICE turned in record average daily volumes exceeding 300,000 contracts per day for the first time due to increased price volatility and improvement in the European credit markets. In addition to sugar, average daily volume records were set in coffee and cocoa in the second quarter.","I also want to update you on our progress with integrating the ICE Endex business, which includes the natural gas futures and spot markets of the former APX-ENDEX exchange. Volumes were up 10% in the first half, and during the fourth quarter, we'll begin including the Endex business in our monthly volume releases. For the eighth consecutive quarter, our European emissions futures and options volumes grew year-on-year, with average daily volume up 25% in the second quarter. Carbon prices remain low, but they've been supported more recently by the advancement of a European plan for the back-loading of emissions allowances. The final vote to support back-loading is expected next month, and if passed, allowances would likely be withheld from auctions starting early next year. In the meantime, we expect emissions volumes to be muted as the market awaits more clarity for this back-loading plan, just as we saw in July.","I'll now turn to our pending acquisition of NYSE Euronext on Slide 13. I think you can see that, based on our results today and by the strong results announced by NYSE Euronext last week, that this transaction will bring together 2 of the leading global exchange groups, with diverse markets, strong financial performance and global brands. We're excited about entering the financial futures markets and becoming a leader in the global capital markets with the NYSE brand. Amid a rapidly evolving regulatory landscape, this transaction enables us to respond to the needs of our global customer base across more asset classes. We're more confident than ever that this strategic, efficient transaction will create long-term value and sustainable growth.","The timeline continues to play out as expected. Based on the final approvals required from the SEC and the European financial regulators, we believe that the deal will be finalized this fall. We've already completed the U.S. and European competition approval processes, and we've received overwhelming approval from both sets of our shareholders.","Our integration planning continues to give us confidence that we're well positioned to deliver on our synergy expectation of a combined $450 million.","As we stated upon the announcement of our transaction, we will establish an annual $300 million dividend following the deal closing. We'll provide more details on the dividend as our timing becomes clear and as we formally establish the dividend policy with our final board's approval. We'll also keep you informed as to the closing of our transaction as it approaches. We look forward to leading as one company that is focused on our customers.","And to conclude, on Slide 14, we've listed the objectives that we set out at the beginning of the year for you, along with a summary of the progress that we've made in the first half. From the continued growth in our commodity markets to clearing interest rates for the first time in ICE's history, to progressing our NYSE transaction, these are the drivers of our growth today, as well as the basis for opportunity longer term. We remain intimately engaged with market participants to ensure that we stay responsive in a way that enables our customers to perform, to comply and to grow. And as Scott mentioned, we remain on track to achieve our operational and financial objectives, including another record year in 2013. And we remain confident that the combination of ICE and NYSE Euronext provides a strong foundation for our future growth.","So on behalf of everyone at ICE, I'd like to thank our customers for trusting us with their business last quarter. I also want to thank our global team that continues to drive record results. And with that, I'll now ask Kevin, our operator, to conduct the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I guess I was hoping you could talk about the Brent versus WTI dynamics a little bit more. Certainly, I think your competitors kind of played up how some of the supply issues in Cushing have been resolved, and so that's kind of helped WTI. Can you just talk about where you see the dynamics of that going over the next several quarters?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Sure. Well, we also have a WTI contract. It's an important contract to us, so having the supply issues around Cushing, Oklahoma, come back to some amount of normalcy has been helpful in those people that trade the Brent\/WTI spread. But I would remind you that the reason that, historically, people traded the Brent\/WTI spread was because the United States was an importer of foreign oil and the Brent\/WTI spread, in some manner, represented the transportation cost between bringing oil from the North Sea into the Gulf Coast. And as the United States had very successfully found new sources of oil and it's becoming less of a net importer and potentially moving to a situation where we have excess capacity, I think the market is telling us that the Brent\/WTI spread is likely to move out again, representing the fact that the United States is likely not to be a major net exporter of crude oil in the near term. So that being said, there is trading dynamics around that whole supply management for our customers, who are largely commercial, who are having to hedge global trends and then regional trends in the United States. I mentioned in our prepared remarks that we still maintain 100% of the revenues in the world for the trading of Brent futures, and I can't ask the team to do any more than that. It's really almost near-perfect execution. And we continue to grow our market share of WTI as we continue to push on the efficiencies of trading that complex at our exchange and also, as the unintended consequence of people laying off positions because they're being paid to trade at a competitor, actually, net benefit, I believe, our market share.","Scott A. Hill","Patrick, just to put a head on that, our ROI and share of OI and our share of volume in WTI have consistently increased each quarter for the last few quarters, and our revenues increased significantly for the first half of the year in the WTI contract.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","And then, the knock-on effect is that because there are -- people are being paid to trade, they also move in the middle distillate markets on our competitor and then lay off some of that risk with us, and so our share of the middle distillate market seems to also be increasing.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","All right. I appreciate that commentary. And then second for me, just on the CDS Index Futures, I think the uptick has been a little bit slow on those contracts. Can you talk about the traction that you're seeing with customers starting to explore and use those contracts?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Yes. So I agree with you that -- I was hoping that it would take off faster than it has, but we remain committed to try to move the market to a different way of trading credit. And what our customers have told us is that they need a tool or help in how to value the product that we've launched versus what has historically traded in the market. So we have been building, for the market, a pricing tool, which we'll be rolling out soon, that we believe will help people. We also have a couple of firms that have agreed that they're going to make markets in that futures contract as that tool rolls out. So that, coupled with, we hope, the timing of the market's uptake of -- prediction of how Basel is going to impact trading and Volcker, Dodd-Frank and EMIR, we hope all of those wins will continue to push people towards this contract and that we get the timing right. We do have a number of other futures contracts that we've made a commitment to roll out, but we really want to try to keep effort focused on this new one for a while to see if we can move the market and if these other secular trends are enough to sort of tip it that way.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Outside of just suppressed energy volatility and a return to more traditional seasonality this year, I was -- I know we're only halfway through the year, Jeff, but when you take a step back, is there anything else that hasn't gone the way you hope to achieve those double-digit growth target you aspire to? And what's making you and the team hopeful that we reattach to that in the next 6 months?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, we have -- we can't solely control volumes, so the only thing we really can control around here with any discipline is expenses. And that's what we've been trying to do, is control our expenses. We are -- we did report 12% bottom line growth, so we're very pleased, particularly given that fundamental change is going on in our client base, as I mentioned in prepared remarks, where assets are moving around as a result of regulatory changes, and they're moving around globally not just in the United States. And then, coupled with the fact that we had a very, very large and continue to have a very large U.S. natural gas business that is being substantially reengineered around the discovery of shale gas, so there's a lot of movement right now. So our customers are trying to get their arms around that. But all of that change, I think, bodes well for the need for customers to manage risk, and ultimately, the hedging of prices is what we're providing. So we continue to remain confident in the complex that we have.","Scott A. Hill","When you go down through it, Howard, I mean, the U.S. gas and power revenues were down in the first half. Every oil product was up. Sugar was up. Every Ag product was up. Foreign exchange products were up. Every product we have outside, the U.K. natural gas and power revenues were up, so our revenues were up across the board. And on only a slight volume increase, we saw a significant profit increase as opposed to others who are getting a lot of credit for volume increases and no profit growth at all.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Makes sense. And then my follow-up, Jeff, I wanted to come back to your comments on integration planning. Just given all the moving parts of the merger, the incorporation of newer ICE businesses like their technology business, listings, cash equities, I was just hoping you could share with us maybe what you've learned incrementally. What surprised you as you go deeper into the planning process? And what aspects of that planning process do you still need to weigh to have your hands like officially on the wheel to make final decisions and progress forward?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Sure. Well, we did receive our antitrust approvals earlier this year so -- earlier this summer, so it's allowed, in the last few weeks, for us to become more intimately involved in exchanging information with NYSE Euronext. I should tell you that Duncan Niederauer, the NYSE Euronext CEO and his team have been phenomenal in working with us and helping to identify how we can integrate the businesses. They've just been great, and progress over the last few weeks since receiving our antitrust approvals has been significant. And so we feel very, very good, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, about achieving the synergies that we promised. We have a real roadmap in understanding now on how we can do that and the timing of how that can lay out, and we feel very comfortable that between the 2 companies, we have the resources to really move on that now. And so it's been rewarding to confirm the expectations that we had going into the deal.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I guess the first question is on the CDS buy-side clearing. And Scott, you talked a little bit about it last quarter. But you, at least, gave a response that there was an upside surprise. So I guess, the question is, are we at that $4 million to $5 million buy-side clearing that you talked about being in the back half of the year? And then, what run rate are we looking at exiting in June with -- or July with the mandate? And if you could, just describe what the experience -- what you went through in this onboarding in Phase 2, I guess.","Scott A. Hill","Yes. I think the $4 million to $5 million was something one of you suggested I should provide for the back half of the year. I tried to tamp that down. But in the second quarter, I'll tell you that probably it was closer to where we came in. I think a lot of that, though, in the second quarter, did have the fact that we had the benefit -- mandatory clearing for the Phase 1 was March, so we only got about 0.5 month of that, and that rolled into the second quarter. We got a number of people that signed up during the quarter so that when mandatory clearing kicked in, in Phase 2 in June, we had a pretty good wind at our back. I think what we're seeing in the third quarter, so far, is a little bit of the more typical seasonality. So we've got, as I said, over 400 firms signed up, over 250 firms clearing. And so there's been a little bit of a slowdown in July, but I think that's seasonality. As I look over the course of the rest of the year, there are probably another 150 firms or so that will come in with Phase 3, which will put us at 500 to 600 firms as you roll into September.","And so as we've talked about, when you go back to when we started, I think the first year revenues were kind of in the $20 million range. And then, a year later, it was $40 million, and then we got to $60 million. In the last couple of years, we've kind of plateaued out in the mid-$60 million in revenue. And if you look at where we're trending right now, we can easily be at or above $85 million this year in CDS clearing. And I think it's just -- you're going to continue to see us step it up as you move through the phases, and that's still with an execution market that's flat on its back. And so as we grow this business, from a clearing standpoint, that's really us continuing to launch new products. I talked about western sov, which we still intend to launch. I talked about European client clearing, which we're going to launch in October. So we're still adding new products, adding new customers and have yet to see any benefit at all from a recovery in the overall CDS market. So we feel very good about the contribution of that business this year in the first half and certainly, as we get into the back half. And I think the opportunities for us to continue to incrementally grow that business quarter after quarter are there.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. I mean, it appears like there isn't a discounting going on, on the CDS buy-side like it appears, say, in other asset classes as they go after the buy-side and, say, interest rates. But anyway, I want to move on to my follow-up. Jeff, you talked last quarter about the globalization of natural gas index and the different benchmarks. You have Europe, North America, et cetera. But I guess, the natural gas volumes, because of the low volatility, you saw a nice March, April, but then it's come down again. And I'm just trying to see is your long-term -- you've never been a guy to look really short term, but is the long-term bullishness still there? And is the natural gas market, would you equate it to somewhat like interest rates, where there's some pent-up leverage starting to be built because of the lower volumes?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","It's a good question. What's going on in our minds is that in the United States and in Europe and Canada, we have this various delivery points, where people did basis trade. And the movement of natural gas right now is being completely changed, both in the United States and then more broadly, globally, as liquefaction starts to come into play. So people are trying to figure out how to hedge material price risks with that different movement, and the market doesn't really know how our prices are going to respond to natural volatility, which happens in the energy complex with hurricanes and with heating and cooling needs. So I do think there is some pent-up need because when we talk to customers, they tell us that they're being cautious in where they take positions, until they've seen a couple of business cycles and price movement cycles through the market. And so I think all that causes people to tiptoe a little bit. But as I said in my prepared remarks, what we have seen is although there are historic -- relatively historically low natural prices in the U.S., we still do have these sort of seasonal price shocks that come in, and then, all of a sudden, volatility obviously goes up and volumes follow. And the market is just trying to get an education about how that's going to work going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JP Morgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to focus on clearing maybe from a higher-level perspective. It's been an enormous growth engine for ICE over the last decade, and I think you kind of drove the evolution to cleared OTC. And then you internalized cleared futures and now we're in cleared financial OTC. What are your thoughts about the future and importance of portfolio margining and clearing? And given your breadth of clearing, both by product and geography, are there opportunities to become more of a provider of clearing solutions, like what you're doing with New York today, maybe what CME did with CBOT way back when? And if that's completely off the reservation, what do you think are the next big clearing opportunities for ICE outside of the clearing of credit?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","It's a good question. I think we all know that with new bank regulation coming in and client clearing responsibilities now being imposed globally that capital for trading is going to become increasingly more scarce and as a result of that, portfolio margining increasingly more important. And then you have to balance that against the need and desire of the market to not under-margin somebody, particularly a multi-asset-class company, like a bank, that could become systemic. So both prudent risk management and regulators are going to go slow, I suspect, on how they allow portfolio margining to make its way through the industry. And we've seen that ICE has really broken new ground by coming to a regulatory oversight with both the CFTC and the SEC, who've agreed on a portfolio margining strategy for us. Something in the United States that's been talked about for years, maybe decades, which is the portfolio margining of a securities account against a futures account, and we're the first to really head down that path. I think it's working really well in our credit default swap area. You can -- as Scott mentioned, it attracted the buy side into our CDS clearing in the last few weeks. So portfolio margining does work, if you will. There are a lot of things that trade in the world, and my own sense is that as the market becomes more comfortable with clearing, the operation of clearing and the new custodial and collateral infrastructure that's going to be built around clearing globally, that people will actually seek out clearing for new products that heretofore had not been cleared. The reason I think that is because we started this company with the notion of just clearing OTC energy, and the market had no interest in that product until Enron collapsed. And then when Enron collapsed, the market was only interested in having bad credit counterparties use clearing. But over time, between us and our competitors, we continue to market and drive people into clearing on a voluntary basis and then broadened the offerings within these clearing houses. And on a completely voluntary basis, we really moved the energy industry into clearing. So I have the same view that as regulators are now nudging financials and others into clearing houses, that customers will, on a voluntary basis, now want to do more and more within a clearing house. So we have positioned ourselves globally for growth in that area, and it's been the area probably of the most significant focus and investment in this company for the last few years.","Scott A. Hill","And the only thing I'd add, Ken, is uniquely we have positioned ourselves globally. But we've also positioned ourselves with clearing houses operating in local jurisdiction. So we've got a meaningful clearing house in Europe, a meaningful clearing operation in Canada, a meaningful clearing house in the U.S. for futures and another meaningful clearing house that does CDS. So we've got a global presence, but we also have local operations that are able to serve customers who have different needs or that are under different regulations or laws.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Allen with Evercore.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on the transition of the energy business out of the banks and into other players and whether you believe that's helpful or hurtful for volumes right now. And how long do you see that transition playing out? And who are the key replacement players that are going to take over the business from the banks?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Sure. Well, first of all, I guess, I read a report recently that commodity revenues at banks are down this year around 25%. If you look at what we just reported, which was a 12% EPS growth, you could see that our footprint is incredibly broad and we are not really levered to -- specifically to what's going on inside the banking community in the commodities footprint. That being said, what banks are -- seem to be doing right now is moving out of the physical commodities area, warehousing, polling agreements, other things that are really at the final trade, if you will, and then concentrating their resources on the forward and futures markets to serve customers who have longer-term hedging needs. And those -- that physical infrastructure is making its way into other hands because these are really valid businesses. So these new owners like Citi putting Phibro out or rumors that JPMorgan may sell part of its warehousing business, those assets will continue to need to be risk-managed. We've also seen that some of these new physical players are choosing to register as swap dealers. So as new entrants get control of physical warehouses and infrastructure, they themselves may move back in time to manage risk by being swap dealers. So overall, it's an expansion of the market. And when the market expands, it drives our data revenues, it makes having a Central Limit Order Book more important to the market because people have a hard time finding other people. So all of that, I think, plays to the strength of the model that we're operating, and in that sense it doesn't scare us. We do play a role in the background, helping traders and risk managers relocate. We know a lot of people and exchanges in area of commonality, where people can come on a neutral basis. So we have an active dialogue with individuals in the market, helping them to move around, helping money to find people and that kind of thing. And so I think those trends out there, on a macro basis, somewhat potentially disruptive, I think, longer term, they really play to our strengths.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it. And just wondering how much did Endex contribute from a revenue perspective for this quarter?","Scott A. Hill","I don't -- Chris, I don't think we broke that out. But I'd tell you it's relatively small in the scheme of things, and the profit contribution similarly was small, a few million dollars.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just on the CDS business, just wanted to get your sense. We've had Phase 1 and Phase 2 in the U.S. is on track. You mentioned Europe coming onboard and then also some new products. When you size those opportunities versus the current run rate, just, like, what's the potential there? And then, probably more importantly, you mentioned that the CDS volumes are still on their back. I mean, we see that, but given that we've gotten some more clarity in terms of the outlook, are you sensing, from the users, any potential to start to see volumes pick up? Or what could potentially be that catalyst?","Scott A. Hill","Yes. I think those are both good questions. Let me start with the clearing one. So from a clearing standpoint, I think there are -- as I said, I think there are a number of opportunities. We've got 400 clearing members signed up -- or over 400, another 150 we think we get in Phase 3. But only -- I think it was 268 was the precise number that are clearing today. So there's an opportunity in another 300-ish customers that aren't clearing today that will clear in the future. There's the buy-side clients in Europe, who haven't had an offering yet. We'll launch our buy-side offering in Europe in October. Look, I think the reality is similar to the U.S. I don't know that the buy side is going to come rushing in the day it's available. I think it will depend on ultimately when EMIR makes the clearing mandatory, but that's another wave of growth that's in front of us. Western European sov, we've been working the launch effort, feels like, 3 years. And we're -- I think we're at the last step with the regulators there, and I'm hopeful we get that done this year. That's another growth contributor. So look, I said earlier, we kind of plateaued in the mid-60s. We're on our way this year to the mid-80s. There's no reason, in my view, that, that business can't get north of $100 million over the next year or 2. And again, that's without any pickup in the market, which kind of segues to the second part of your question. I do think that getting the SEF rules written down, continuing to work with customers on the CDS future product and refining that product and understanding what tools they need in getting people convinced to come in and make market. I do think that, that ultimately will help that market turn around. There's no question that there is still a market in the banks and with the buy side and an interest in trading credit. Whether or not that's in the traditional OTC product or it's in the futures product that we're launching, whether it moves to a futures exchange or on a SEF, I think it's difficult to see. But I do think we're starting to see the foundation solidify for the execution market to turn. Again, whether that's third or fourth quarter or into early next year, I think it's difficult to call. We're managing right now our brokerage business to basically hang in there and break even. We're introducing product. We're working with customers. So then it was -- when it does turn, we're positioned, and in the meantime, we continue to earn money on the clearing operations. But I think the best news for us is when the execution market does turn, not only will we benefit in the execution, but it will multiply the benefits we see on the clearing.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And Jeff, maybe just a quick one on the last question. And I know it's early, but if the banks are exiting in some of the areas of commodities, based on the users that are likely to take over in those areas and if their activity levels start to ramp up, based on your relationship with the banks versus those users, is there anything else that you guys provide? Or could activity be strong or weaker based on a different participant in the market doing different types of trades? Or is it -- it doesn't really matter, it's still the same type of activity?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","No, I think the more markets get fragmented, the more markets look to Central Limit Order Book. I mean, we had, in most markets, structures around the world. In most markets, you had this concept of dealers and then you had a concept of interdealer brokers, brokers like Creditex that we acquired, that solely serviced a small group of dealers at the wholesale level and then protected the pricing so that the dealers can make money at the retail level. And as that breaks down, you start to move to an all-to-all market and fragmented market and a lack of interdealer brokerage coverage of these new market participants. And as such, the movement to a Central Limit Order Book type market or a central marketplace maybe is the best way to say it, is enhanced. And that trend has been going on in energy. When we started the company, I reached out to the 13 largest -- Chuck and I reached out to the 13 largest market makers other than Enron, and at that time, they were 85% of our volume. And today, it's small, that same group. It has been overwhelmed by the growth in the market and us onboarding increasingly more diverse commercial users.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo Securities.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I know it's a smaller business for you, but just curious to get your thoughts on what you think it's going to take to get better volume outcomes in equity index. And along with that, just curious to see if you think there's any secular growth left in this asset class or if it's more just kind of a cyclical play at this point.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, we love all of our children here so...","Scott A. Hill","You wanted them cash positive, yes.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","One of the things that we've been talking a lot with our colleagues in NYSE Euronext is how to organize a global equity index business, combining what they have and what we have. And I think there are some really interesting opportunities for us there. So we'll have more to say about it as we unveil the exact movements of integration. But maybe not to be too coy, we do think that, together, a meaningful group of equity indices on a common platform are likely to drive growth. And in some cases, the correlation is likely to drive clearing efficiencies.","Operator","Our next question comes from Niamh Alexander with KBW.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","If I could go back to kind of the energy business, the strategic part of what you do that drives growth. You used to talk about how you were seeing some growth from Asia. And I don't know if we got any hard stats, but you were seeing a lot of growth from Asia. But we're kind of increasingly seeing some more data points about Chinese firms specifically setting up as futures commissions merchants and even buying commissions -- futures commissions merchants. So can you expand on what you're seeing, what you're actually doing there? And where, in the phase of growth, do you think this customer growth is?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Sure. Well, first of all, Asia is a complicated region. As you know, it's not 1 country there, sort of multiple things going on in Asia. But generally speaking, with the passage of Dodd-Frank in the United States and now EMIR in Europe and legislation that's coming and being adopted in Singapore, where a lot of commodity commerce is done, the market can kind of seize 3 regulatory buckets. And we've seen a bit of balkanization, and I think it comes from the fact that the further you are from a jurisdiction, probably the less you understand about the local regulation. So we've done -- ICE has done well because we have footprints in all 3 of those regulatory jurisdictions and are providing different solutions to each of those. In Asia, we see people wanting to have more identity into who their counterparties are, so not completely anonymous trading. Part of that is there is an aversion by some Asian companies to be pulled into different regulatory jurisdictions without their knowledge. So at this point, particularly because they don't fully understand Dodd-Frank, and Dodd-Frank is complicated even for those of us that live in this country, what you see is sort of regional trading staying regionally. And so we've been investing in tools and what have you for the uptake of that business in Asia regionally. We do see interest by, particularly, Chinese companies in establishing footprints out of the region, and that trend has continued. We've seen talk about Chinese firms trying to acquire businesses that are non-China locations, and all of that is sort of continuing to drive interest around a Singapore hub for us.","Scott A. Hill","And I think that's one of the reasons, Niamh, that if you look, even with the somewhat tepid July results, our oil business, which a lot of that is driven out of -- a meaningful number is driven out of Asia, that business still grew in July, up 7% year-over-year. So I think you're seeing similar to what Jeff talked about embedded in the numbers, particularly if you watch our oil numbers.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And if I could have a quick follow-up. Your post trade business, I guess, we don't kind of ask about them a lot. But I see confirmed and the trading hub and whatnot, is there an opportunity here that we should be thinking about for maybe some outsized growth once the SEF rule gets confirmed? Is there an opportunity for you to be generating revenue even if people are not using your SEF with some of these services?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, that's a good question, and it's obviously strategically our thinking, is that we want to -- there's a lot of places that you can touch transactions along the transaction highway, and we want to be there. We love having an end-to-end solution, but where we can't, we'd like to at least be a part of a rest stop along the highway. My colleague who runs our confirmation business was just talking to me before this earnings call about how well things are going for us just in the confirmation space and how excited that team is. We continue to add to that team and invest in it. We do think that -- we don't exactly know how these are going to play out. Nobody can really see that, but we do think providing those kinds of solutions could be interesting opportunities for us. And more importantly, we make it easy on customers to comply. And I think the market probably underestimates the role that a central exchange plays on helping to educate and make sure that our customers are in compliance. We are a self regulator organization. We do have regulatory authority. But way before our customers cross some regulatory barrier, we are dialoguing with them to make sure that they recognize the trends that their businesses have and remaining compliant. And I think that -- having all those tools around that will be, long term, beneficial.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Hill with Barclays.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just wanted to follow up here on the transition to ICE Clear Europe earlier in July. I'm just wondering, since the transition, if you could provide any color or feedback you've heard from customers on cross-selling opportunities, maybe more if you've kind of made any changes to your sales force to help capitalize on potential opportunities down the road with the multi-asset clearinghouse going forward.","Scott A. Hill","Yes, so I mean, clearly, one of the biggest conversations that we had with our Liffe colleagues early days, both Chuck and I, was with regards to the number of products that they wanted to launch to meet the customer demand. And they were working with, at that moment, a somewhat nonresponsive clearing provider. And so now that we have gotten job 1 done, which was to get the clearing moved over into ICE Clear Europe, we are actively involved with Liffe in working with them on the products that they are looking to launch to serve the needs of the customers, with whom they're directly in dialogue. And I think the other important point is we do have a separate guarantee fund that we've set up with regards to the interest rate business, which goes back to one of the questions earlier that Jeff has gotten with regards to the portfolio margining. In some instances, that makes a lot of sense, single names versus index. But at the same time, as a multiproduct or multi-asset-class clearinghouse, there are customer communities who want to know that, \"I'm in interest rates. And I don't want that to be cleared with CDS, and I don't want that to be cleared with energy.\" And so in this case, for interest rates, we did set up a separate guarantee fund and are working directly with those interest rate customers to serve the need that they've gotten. And I would tell you that the list of products that Liffe would like to get launched and so therefore, that we would like to get launched is long, and it's one of the key opportunities for us in the coming months.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","And if I could just add that, we haven't talked much publicly about it, but moving a major exchange from one clearinghouse to another is an unbelievably complicated effort, and it involves hundreds of people. We can control, obviously, the people in our organization, but there were 43 clearing firms that had to move. They had -- all along the way, they had to be testing with us, back-testing. We had to have backup and default plans for what we would do if things went wrong and be betting all of those. We had a lot of legal agreements and structures. So this involved hundreds and hundreds of people, and it was amazing to watch the industry rally around these efforts, support what my colleagues did and move really flawlessly. And by the next Monday, light went on, business as usual. So I really want to thank and congratulate these hundreds of people that really did this because it was quite an accomplishment.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. I just had one quick follow-up here on the SEF. So you guys are looking to roll that out later this quarter. Just kind of wondering how you see the kind of competition evolve in that business. Like, what do you think are the key factors around being successful? I think historically, you guys have kind of prided yourself on your technology offering, your service offering versus something like maybe price, where others might compete. But to that effect, I'm kind of wondering why there wasn't maybe broader support from the dealer community around the rollout, and maybe how you expect that to kind of grow going forward.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Yes, it's a very good question. First of all, the SEF space in the United States is lining up to be incredibly competitive. I think ultimately, that means that some competitors are going to have to compete on low price, and so it's hard to know what the economics of operating a SEF may be. It may be quite poor unless you're really doing something novel and unique. And you're right in the sense that we have a multiform strategy on how we intend to roll out our SEF. It's not based on price. It is based on technology and a holistic view of futures and OTC coming together in one global marketplace. And built into that, there's a lot of regulatory obligations now for traders and recordkeeping and other things, and it's our intent to really provide solutions that can ultimately satisfy those needs so that the people don't have to work too hard to trade. We've got -- in the case of what we've announced to partners that have agreed to make markets on our SEF, so we expect to launch with a lot of initial liquidity, which is always key, as you know. And so in a sense, we picked out and found people that we thought would be able to do that on a day-in and day-out basis, and that's how we selected partners. There were other people that have been interested in our offering that we chose not to bring in.","Operator","This concludes the Q&A portion of today's conference.

Loeffler","Good morning. ICE's first quarter 2012 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investor section of our website at theice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay.","Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the company's Form 10-Q, which was filed with the SEC this morning.","With us today are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Chuck Vice, President and Chief Operating Officer. We'll conduct a question-and-answer session after our prepared remarks. ","I'll now turn the call over to Scott.","Scott A. Hill","Thanks, Kelly. Good morning, and thank you, all, for joining us on the call today. ICE is off to another strong start in 2012, delivering record results, including solid revenue growth and double-digit earnings and cash growth. These results are on top of last year's double-digit growth and continue to differentiate ICE from our competition. ","I'd like to start this morning on Slide 4 with an overview of our first quarter performance. As a result of our focus on top line growth and expense discipline, ICE again delivered record revenues and record net income. Against what remained a challenging market and economic backdrop, we continue to deliver growth on top of growth. ","Revenues in each of our business lines grew, including in our futures business, where strong revenue captured trends mitigated soft volume. Volatility in natural gas and a continued migration of bilateral oil business in the clearing drove strength in OTC energy. And the addition of new clearing members and continued expansion of our electronic capabilities enabled our CDS business to grow. ","Importantly, a growing number of participants are looking to ICE to help them manage their risks and meet regulatory requirements in an efficient manner. So as we continue to develop and expand our existing businesses, we are also constantly developing the next set of opportunities, with recent examples including our Brazilian ventures, FX clearing and efforts around European natural gas and power markets. ICE remains focused on delivering current period growth even as we invest in these longer-term enablers of our future growth.","Moving to Slide 5. I'll detail our first quarter results. Consolidated revenues rose 9% over the prior first quarter to $365 million. Operating margins expanded to 62%, enabling operating income to grow 11% to a record $225 million. Net income attributable to ICE rose 15% to a record $148 million, and earnings per share were $2.02, up 16% year-on-year. Capital expenditures and capitalized software totaled $15 million, and cash flow from operations rose to $186 million.","Turning to Slide 6. I'll review the components of our consolidated revenue and expenses for the first quarter. As noted earlier, each product category grew during the quarter. Futures revenues rose 1% to a record $160 million. OTC energy revenues increased 19% to a record $123 million on strong natural gas and oil volumes. And OTC credit contributed $40 million, the third consecutive quarter of year-on-year revenue growth. Taken together, consolidated transaction and clearing revenues increased 8% to $322 million. Market data revenues grew 24% to a record $36 million as our customer base continued to grow and expand globally.","Let's move to the right side of Slide 6 for a look at our consolidated expenses. ICE's first quarter operating expenses rose 7% to $140 million. We improved operating margin to 62%, compared to 61% in last year's first quarter. Comp and benefits expense rose 10% on increased employee headcount, which supports our growth initiatives and regulatory reform implementation.","SG&A expenses include $2 million related to the cleanup of some U.K. indirect tax matters, which we anticipate will not be a part of our run rate expense in subsequent quarters. And finally, as previously disclosed, we had $3 million of acquisition-related expense reflective of the M&A component of our growth strategy. This amount was in line with the prior year, and we expect this expense to again be in the range of $3 million to $4 million in the second quarter this year.","Disciplined investment remains a core part of our growth strategy, and we continue to expect 2012 expense growth in the range of 3% to 6%. We believe that the expense level will continue to support our double-digit earnings growth objective and our strategic initiatives.","Moving to Slide 7, I'll walk through our futures segment performance. While we achieved record revenue for this segment during the quarter, average daily volume, or ADV, declined 3%. The largest decline came in the WTI crude futures contract following the continued shift by customers to the benchmark Brent contract. In addition, this year's quarter saw a reduced oil market volatility following the first quarter of 2011 geopolitical shock, including the earthquake in Japan and Middle East unrest. Nonetheless, we recorded double-digit volume increases in Brent, European natural gas, emissions, U.S. heating oil and gasoline. We also continued to grow our options complex.","Gasoil volume declined modestly from 1Q 2011. This was primarily due to lower volatility, but also due to supply shortages that reduced physical inventory. We're working with our customers to develop a global diesel market through the new ICE low sulfur Gasoil contract as the physical market begins to move to lower sulfur content product. We believe the relevance of this new contract will further enhance our leadership position in this market and anticipate the transition to occur over the next year or so.","European emissions volumes rose 25% from the same period one year ago. This is on the heels of 23% volume growth in all of 2011. The catalyst for emissions continues to be Phase III of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme where more industries and companies, such as airlines, will be required to participate in the market. And building on the momentum we've established in this market, last month, ICE Futures Europe was awarded the U.K. Auction Platform mandate to serve as the venue for auctioning Phase III and EU aviation credit later this year.","Moving to agricultural contracts. We've seen improving levels of OI over the past few months, which has resulted in strengthening volume in many of our ag contracts. Sugar futures and options volumes were off 6% year-to-year in the first quarter but grew 14% in April due in part to a slight recovery in the trade financing issues that have impacted that market. Ag revenues in the quarter generally benefited from strong revenue capture, as you can see on Slide 7. Rate per contract in the quarter was $2.68, compared to $2.15 one year ago, as the result of a price increase in January. This increase reflects the significant enhancements in clearing and trading introduced at ICE Futures U.S. since our 2007 acquisition.","Building on our suite of agricultural contracts and at the request of market participants, we plan to launch corn and soybean futures and options on May 14 at ICE Futures U.S. And in January, ICE Futures Canada launched the Canadian wheat contract which we anticipate will gain traction as we enter the growing season.","Finally, due to volatility levels not seen in 5 years, our equity index and currency volumes were roughly flat for the quarter. The Russell futures contract, however, had outperformed among U.S. equity index futures year-to-date in terms of growth and share gain. Importantly, open interest across all our futures exchanges at the end of the first quarter was up 14% year-to-year, which supported April average daily volume growth of 21%, as was reported earlier this morning.","Turning now to Slide 8, I'll review our record OTC performance. Average daily commissions in our energy markets grew 20% to a record $1.9 million. North American natural gas revenues grew 26% over the prior first quarter to $81 million, and global oil revenues rose 39% to $15 million in the quarter. In 2011, we added over 250 [ph] new OTC energy contracts and, we continued to work with our customers to develop new products in clearing services.","In the first quarter, we launched 42 new cleared OTC energy contracts. The contribution from new products rose to $12 million in the quarter, up from $7 million in the prior year. OTC energy open interest was 44% year-to-year to a record 58 million contracts. In April, our OTC commissions were $1.5 million, up slightly from April 2011.","In our credit derivatives business, first quarter revenues totaled $40 million, up slightly from last year's first quarter. This included $24 million from Creditex and $16 million from CDS clearing. We have now cleared over $30 trillion in gross notional value of CDS and have open interest of over $1.6 trillion.","Today we are the only U.S. or European solution to have cleared even $1 trillion in notional value and the only clearinghouse to list single name and sovereign instruments. In total, ICE cleared 345 CDS products, which is 200 more contracts than our nearest competitor.","Finally, ICE's CDS risk model is compliant with anticipated Dodd-Frank requirements, including 5-day margining and a guaranteed fund that provides for the simultaneous default of the 2 largest members. We continue to await regulatory clearance by the SEC to provide portfolio margining, which the buy-side community has identified as a key catalyst for them to begin clearing CDS at meaningful levels.","In the first quarter, 62% of Creditex's revenues were electronic, and Creditex's joint service offering with market, known as credit fixing, successfully provided settlement services for the auction of Greek sovereign debt. We are finalizing work on the development of our SEF platform for CDS as rules become final. Our experience, technology and customer relationships continue to position us well in the credit markets.","Before moving to my final slide, I'd like to emphasize a very important point about our track record of growth. Our solid revenue growth in the first quarter was driven by strength in OTC energy, despite future volume decline and a soft CDS execution market. We've built a business, though, capable of consistently generating growth on growth without depending on any single product, asset class or business segment. As a prime example, our April revenues grew double-digit despite a pullback in OTC energy due to very strong futures volume. This balanced business model is yet another important competitive differentiator for ICE.","I'll conclude my remarks on Slide 9 by highlighting our strong financial position. In the first quarter, cash flow was $186 million, up 19% from 2011. We ended the quarter with nearly $1 billion in cash, no net debt, low leverage and access to a committed line of credit of $1.8 billion.","We repurchased $175 million worth of shares at $113 a share in 2011. Today, we have over $330 million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. As a result of our strong balance sheet and cash generation, we are well positioned to continue to invest in key strategic growth initiatives and expand our existing businesses, and we will continue to opportunistically repurchase our own shares. As always, our investments will be disciplined and driven by a commitment to deliver industry-leading returns on investment that create meaningful value for our shareholders.","With that, I'll be available to answer your questions during the Q&A. Jeff, over to you.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Thank you, Scott, and thank you, all, for joining us this morning.","With record revenues and double-digit earnings growth in the first quarter, 2012 is off to a strong start. In spite of the economic headwinds and as we enter the fourth year of financial reform discussions, ICE's diverse businesses and customer base remains a solid platform for growth, enabling us to thrive amid uncertainty.","Our strategic diversification has resulted in sustainable growth and earnings consistency. You can see that playing out already this year. While our first quarter was driven by the OTC segment, double-digit growth in April was driven primarily by strong futures volume. We continue to focus on solving the complex problems that come with change so that our customers can do more business.","We also recognize that as a company, we're not finished growing into our opportunity set. One example is supporting compliance with financial reform. This is an area where we've already added value. With rising demand for risk management and particularly in the area of commodities, ICE today is probably the best-positioned exchange to support the continuing evolution of global markets. This is why I've been spending a lot of time in conversations with customers to understand their needs and also spending time with policymakers to help them understand our customers. So those are the 2 things I'd like to cover this morning: ICE's responsiveness to financial reform and the expansion of our futures and OTC product sets.","Last month, the CFTC finalized certain of its rules on swap-related definitions under the Dodd-Frank Act. More information on EMIR and MiFID II policies were recently published in Europe, and Singapore published a rule-making draft for comment. Each step in the regulatory rule-making process is providing more visibility for market participants to adjust their businesses, and we're working to support them.","While a great deal of regulatory work remains, you can see on Slide 10 that ICE is working to finalize a number of compliant platforms and systems. We're developing swap execution facilities for energy and credit, and we've delivered a swap data repository for regulatory approval and testing for which we now have over 250 firms enrolled. We recently announced the results of our program to manage high-frequency traders. Our innovative program encourages efficient trading and has proven extremely effective in ensuring high-quality markets.","During the quarter, ICE announced the expansion of our OTC clearing services into the market for non-deliverable forward foreign exchange contracts. We signed agreements with 10 of the largest global players in the foreign exchange space, each of whom has made a commitment to the new clearing venture. Over the last year, we developed this clearing solution alongside dealers, buy-side, FX trading platforms and connectivity providers to provide straight-through processing support.","We will initially clear 7 NDF contracts. This FX clearing house will have a dedicated guarantee fund, and our customers are in the final stages of testing the margin calculators and other processes right now. We're seeing broad interest from participants that wish to voluntarily clear well in advance of regulatory mandates. And for the broader area of OTC execution, we've worked closely with market participants to solve for execution certainty and counter-party credit checks by introducing our Plus One workflow that will be made available to SEFs.","In the same collaborative practical way that ICE created the industry's leading CDS clearing solution, today, we cleared the majority of clearable CDS at $30 trillion in cumulative notional gross value -- notional value as of last week. We anticipate that ICE Clear Credit will be designated as a systemically important financial institution in the United States, and we believe we're very well prepared for that based on our leadership in swaps clearing. We worked extensively with the Fed and with the CFTC and SEC. These are just a few examples of solutions and the experience that we have supporting our customer needs as it relates to regulatory change.","I'd now like to talk a little bit more about how we're expanding our product set. In 2011, half of ICE's revenues came from outside the United States. So year-to-date we've announced new products ranging from U.S. agricultural contract to Asian oil swaps. We've rolled out dozens of new cleared products already this year. And with a record $12 million in new quarterly product revenue, you could see that these product introductions continue to be meaningful.","In our North American natural gas markets, we have record volume in the first quarter. Despite prices reaching 10-year lows, volatility was strong and it drove robust trading. We're now in the seasonally quieter shoulder months of April and May, but we continued to see solid demand for hedging and trading of U.S. natural gas.","Please move to Slide 11 and let me update you on our oil markets. In April, ICE Brent Crude was the most heavily traded crude futures contract in the world. Brent continues to grow in its role as the most widely relied upon oil benchmark, pricing approximately 70% of international oil. Brent derives its physical price references from continuous deepwater oil fields off the coast of Norway and the U.K. This contract has continued to evolve since 1990. And as changes take place in the physical market, the role of our exchange is to ensure that our futures contract properly reflects this underlying market. So following extensive consultation with the industry last year, ICE Futures Europe created the Brent NX contract to reflect the extension of the physical price assessment window. We anticipate growth in the Brent NX volume in the back half of this year as we move closer to the December contract, which is the first monthly contract that we list.","In April, Brent futures and options volume increased 43% and reached a new open interest record. Volume in Brent options were up roughly fivefold in April compared to the prior year. And while the Brent\/TI spread may temporarily narrow with the reversal of the Seaway pipeline, we believe that we will continue to see solid growth in Brent, whether or not the active trading of the Brent\/TI returns to our market anytime soon.","Our Gasoil contracts, which serve as the global benchmark for the middle distillate and diesel market, has overtaken U.S. heating oil in trading volume, primarily due to the increasing importance of hedging transportation fuels. The physical diesel market is 3x to 4x larger than heating oil, which has increased the relevance of Gasoil as a hedging device. The Gasoil contract serves as the basis for an active over-the-counter swap and spread market against other refined products like jet fuel and heating oil, and is the pricing basis for imports from the Middle East, Asia and Europe. ICE's share of middle distillate futures trading grew from approximately 30% in 2001 to roughly 70% today.","Moving to Slide 12, I'll update you on our newer initiatives. We continue to build our trading and risk management infrastructure in Brazil, where we're supporting the development of local markets that are transparent and liquid. One area of focus is our involvement with Cetip. We announced last week that our 2 companies are working together to develop and launch a Brazilian fixed income trading platform. The platform will launch later this year, and it will bring automation and other efficiencies to the fixed income market.","Also in Brazil, volumes on our BRIX venture for trading OTC energy continue to rise at a healthy rate. We now have approximately 100 firms that are enrolled on that platform.","Another new initiative relates to our global positioning and commodities. At the request of market participants, we will launch corn and soybeans futures contracts on ICE Futures U.S. With the top 2 commodity exports from U.S. to Asia being cotton and corn, this will round out our agricultural markets with key contracts. Because we can introduce contracts at low incremental costs, this is a natural product extension for the exchange, and it's based on customer demands. The launch follows the introduction in Canada of wheat futures on ICE Futures Canada in January, and it builds on our existing suite of agricultural products including sugar, cotton, canola and coffee.","Last week, the Griffin Markets Group, a new firm that's founded by former senior executives from Spectron Group, announced that it will launch a multilateral trading facility or MTF in Europe with trading technology that's being provided by ICE. The management team at Griffin has deep experience in the European OTC gas and power markets, and they will launch a firm under the MTF designation within the changing European landscape. Griffin expects to begin in the third quarter of this year, subject to approval by the U.K. Financial Services Authority. ","Our venture with Griffin follows on our past decisions to provide technology to NGX for bringing transparency to the Canadian physical natural gas markets, to interdealer broker ICAP for use in electronifying the European oil swaps markets, to the coal industry platform globalCOAL for trading coal futures contracts in Europe, to the BRIX exchange for trading Brazilian electric power, to McGraw-Hill Platts for assessing the price of global oil markets, and to Cetip for improving the processing of the Brazilian fixed income markets. Our robust technology and infrastructure capabilities are valuable, competitive advantages, which is why we provide our technology to third-parties on a targeted basis.","When we look at entering new markets, we make a buy-versus-build decision. And if we can find entrepreneurs that are more likely to be successful building a business than ICE alone, we back them with our technology under terms that are consistent with our long-term goals and our long-term revenue model. This idea of providing entrepreneurs with technology for start-up initiatives follows, for example, the successful use of this strategy providing technology for the European Climate Exchange, which we acquired in 2010, and which for years has been one of our fastest growing businesses.","We continue to grow by leading with our strength across global exchanges, OTC markets and clearing houses. These businesses are delivering top line growth, and our diversity is a strategic advantage. We remain focused on our 2012 double digit earnings growth goal, and we began this year by delivering earnings that were up 15% on the first quarter on single-digit revenue growth. Our top line revenue growth accelerated in April with double-digit growth, giving us confidence that our strategies remain sound.","In our annual shareholder letter this year, I posed the question, \"What is our business?\" While a basic question, in a dynamic environment this question is more important than ever. And having delivered the best revenue and best earnings quarter in the company's history, we cannot rest on this success. That's why this year, we've already launched a swap data repository, announced the FX clearing initiative, the Cetip fixed income platform, the Griffin energy MTF, the new grains contracts and dozens of new contracts in our core markets. We cannot and have not waited for an economic rebound to deliver results.","To conclude, I'd like to thank our customers for their business in the first quarter. And I'd also like to send my best wishes to Craig Donohue on his retirement. And let's hope that he didn't get up early this morning to listen to this call. And finally, I'd like to thank the ICE team for delivering what is the best quarter in the company's history.","So, I'd now like to turn the call over to the operator to conduct the Q&A session. And Scott, Chuck and I will be here, glad to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rick Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I guess, the first question, Jeff, and we've got to ask it. On the OTC energy commissions, can you give us a little color on the $1.5 million per day? Is that the trend from the last quarter? I know it was $2 million in January -- plus $2 million in January. Is this something seasonal or is this just -- could you just give us a little bit more background on what you know about -- behind the number?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Sure. It's always hard to predict volume. As you know, that's -- and you're in the business of trying to do that, unfortunately. The first quarter, obviously, started off very strong as natural gas in the United States broke below $2. I think at that point, you'd have a lot of people that had shorts on the market and have been riding the price down from $14 and they decided to take their money off the table. But what we saw after that trend was that at this low price, the daily movement of natural gas on a percentage basis is pretty high. And so you have a relatively volatile commodity, even though the absolute price is low. We're now in the shoulder months, where trading is normally soft. We are up year-over-year, so there's still growth in these markets. We have high hopes [ph] that volatility is going to continue for a number of reasons as we move into the typically more robust summer season. First of all, we're going to be moving into the hurricane season. We haven't had hurricanes that have moved through the Gulf of Mexico for the past few years. But the April\/Oct -- the April\/October, Ap\/Oc spread, which is a commonly traded shoulder-month-to-shoulder-month spread, had one of the highest delta prices that we've seen in a long time. So the market is expecting for gas prices to rise as we go through the summer. Having that expectation is a good thing because it means somebody will be right and somebody will be wrong, and I suspect it will create volatility. And you couple that with the potential or not for hurricanes. And I think we could see a continued volatility and hedging in trading going on there. I would also mention to you that we've seen a number of analysts, including Goldman Sachs, comment out and say longer-term trends for natural gas is for upward price. So given that you have those -- whether they're right or not, given that you have those views in the market, it will mean that people will be taking trading positions, and all of that should lead to more volatility, which ultimately should lead to more volume for us.","Scott A. Hill","And Rich, just -- at the risk of being a little bit defensive to -- because I've watched all the notes fly out since we started the call about, \"Great quarter, but OTC at 1.5.\" And I've reminded people that OTC was good in the first quarter and futures were a little bit soft and we grew 9% and double-digit earnings. We remarked, both Jeff and I on the call, that despite OTC being at 1.5, which is growth year-over-year that we had 21% volume growth in our futures business and grew double-digit revenue in April. So we don't actually manage the business to one number and certainly not the OTC number as a sole metric. We manage the business as a whole and we build the business that grows despite any single business on a constant basis. You look at the earnings performance across the competitors for this quarter, and you would be hard-pressed to find anyone else who'd put up any growth at all, much less growth on top of growth. So while we do recognize the importance of the OTC energy business and we're happy to have a great January and February in that number, we don't run the business just on OTC energy lines, and we feel pretty good about the first 4 months of the year.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. Your points are well taken, Scott. Just one follow-up. Jeff, you're known for your innovation and you spent, I think, probably more time sort of outlining your OTC initiatives on -- in Slide 10. I guess, the one question would be can you give us the revenue model? Where do you see the revenue opportunities in the things that you're doing and just the basic general revenue model from any of the initiatives you think are the most important?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Yes, sure. First of all, we recognize that the earnings power in this company is to have variable revenues against fixed expenses, and that we need to manage those expenses. And so on any initiative that we do, we are not particularly interested, for example, in licensing technology or software for some fixed fee. That's just not our model. We want to be market participants. We tend to do best in businesses that we can help create as start-up businesses because we've been very, very good at developing new markets and we have great relationships with customers. So on all the things that I mentioned, whether it's the new clearing for FX or whether it's helping Griffin move into the OTC gas and power space in Europe, or whether it's in Brazil in both energy and fixed income, all of those are areas where we have done licensing deals that are consistent with our model of driving earnings growth. I think all of them are important. And largely, they are -- you can put them all under one umbrella which is there's an overarching trend of large institutional traders wanting more automation. They want to rely on technologies that they know and understand. There's a movement of business towards the good incumbents that are in the space. And some of it is being driven by regulation, and much of it, however, is being driven by cost control in a world where capital efficiencies are becoming king. So we're quite excited. This is quite a portfolio. And as Scott mentioned in his prepared remarks, we continue to invest in the business. We continue to have a lot of new initiatives that are going on inside this firm that we hope we'll be able to talk about on future calls because the opportunity set during this time of change is unbelievably robust.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I wanted to start off on expenses, actually. It seems like they came in a little bit higher than what we and most people expected. I obviously understand you had a really great quarter here in the 1Q, and maybe on the comp side, maybe you already accounted for that a little more, but just wanted to make sure. Your guidance unchanged at 3% to 6%. If I annualized the run rate, it seems like there should be a decline coming over the course of the year. So maybe, Scott, you can just flush it out where there are areas that maybe you'll see paring back a little bit or whether it was upside this quarter.","Scott A. Hill","Yes, one of the things I mentioned, Alex, in my prepared remarks, I think relative to most of the models that you guys have out there, the miss on the $140 million was $2 million. And I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we had some cleanup around some U.K. indirect tax items in SG&A that are not reflective, not reflective of our run rate expense. So I think basically to the extent you had a model that suggests we missed by $2 million or $3 million, it's that one item that drove it, and it's not reflective of where we'd be on a run rate. I reiterated the expense guidance range because we're very comfortable as we sit here at the beginning of May that we will deliver on that. And as we've said often that that mid-single-digit -- the expense growth, 3% to 6%, will support a strong top line and double-digit earnings growth. So I feel pretty good about the expense coming out of the quarter. The one line in terms of growth that was a little bit higher as well was around the comp and benefits line. As you guys know, we are making investments in building out our clearing house in Europe and building out our compliance function and then building out all the various technologies to address the many opportunities that Jeff just alluded to. So overall, setting aside the $2 million of SG&A that won't be in the run rate going forward, I feel pretty good about the way we continue to manage our expense base.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, good. And then just going to ICE U.S., it seems a lot of things happening there right now with the pricing changes and also the introduction of corn and soybean. So maybe on the second part, you mentioned customer demand was driving that. So maybe you can flush out a little bit more, so what exactly it is customers don't like in the common market, what you think your value proposition is to add that and how quickly you think that that can actually ramp up when you talk to your customers.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Sure. Look, if we know when you step back the whole thing sounds kind of daft. But the reality is that we have just been inundated by customers that have asked us to do this. We have a current agricultural business, as you know, and so as we've run that business and gotten to know people and our relationships have deepened, we just see more and more large agribusiness firms that are dissatisfied with the current offerings and there are a number of things, and I don't want to go through them because I don't want to lose our competitive advantage. But suffice to say that even given the difficulty of competing with the incumbents in this space, particularly good incumbents, we really feel that there is an opportunity here. And we have seen, for example, the growth of our U.S. gasoline and U.S. heating oil futures, which are look-alike contracts, and have been surprised by our ability to carve out market share. We probably have about a 10% share in each of those contracts. And because of the low-cost of introducing contracts, that's all highly marginally efficient revenue for us. And so we see the same opportunity to work with our customers here. If it turns out that all of the shortcomings of competitors are changed, then we don't get a lot of volume, we really believe that working deeply with our customers to solve problems is at the root of our success and will put a little notch on our belt that they owe us one. And hopefully it will [indiscernible] a benefit at some other point in time. But net-net, we're a customer-driven company and customers are demanding that from us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Heinz with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","You saw a strong jump in the market data this quarter, which seems to confirm that -- the underlying growth in your customer base. And really 2 things. One, just wondering if there was any price change there that may have helped? And then secondly, what's kind of the historical lag time you've seen between the growth of data in the user base and then their participation in your markets?","Scott A. Hill","So, yes, I'll take that. So we definitely have seen consistently for over the last number of quarters very strong performance in our market data business. As we've alluded to a number of times on the call that there are other metric -- number of trading IDs have been trending up, number of customers who log onto the platforms have been trending up. All of these are very good leading indicators, and along with the growth in OI, give confidence that we'll continue to be able to grow the business. We have continued to adjust our pricing model in data, and did again this quarter, to reflect the growing demand and the additional content that we build into the products that we sell. But I would suggest to you that a larger driver is, as you indicated, continued growth and the interest in our market. I'd be hard-pressed to tell you there's a 1-quarter or 2-quarter or 3-quarter lag in terms of when the market rate of growth translates directly into volume. But I can tell you that there is a strong correlation between the data growth that we've seen and the volume growth that we also see. So it's not a 1-quarter, 2-quarter lag answer. But it clearly is a leading indicator to go along with the other metrics that I mentioned.","Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then as follow-up, we saw some growth in the CDS brokerage this quarter, which was nice to see, but then kind of a lull in the clearing. Can you just speak to the trends you're seeing there in the CDS business and whether there's still an expectation of a pickup on both sides of the business as the SEF rules are finalized?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Yes, I mean, the CDS clearing business is actually up on a year-over-year basis, but it did slow a bit from the fourth quarter. It's not unusual. You get a lot of holidays in January and not a lot of volume pickup. So we still feel pretty good about that business. We continue to add new members into that business, and we're seeing clearing revenue increase from them on a year-over-year basis, as well. We continue to launch new products. We recently launched the Latin American sub in ICE Clear U.S. So feel good about that business. The one area where we continue to work very closely with our customers is on the buy-side. As I mentioned in my remarks, one of the key catalysts that we're looking for is the commingling order from the SEC. We've been told by the buy-side community that that is a key catalyst for them to begin clearing. I mean, they obviously have started to dip their toe in the CDS clearing water a bit. But none of them have started to clear in any meaningful way and to a large extent that's because right now we can't offer them the most efficient clearing that they need via the portfolio requirement. So I feel pretty good about the CDS clearing business, the product offerings that we have, the margin models that we've got, the buy-side interaction that we're seeing. And frankly, it's -- I think the opportunity -- a big part of the opportunity is still in front of us with those buy-side customers and new members moving on. And with regards to the Creditex business, that to me is really a story about what we're doing on the electronics side of things. The DNA business continues to perform very well. We continue to see more of the voice business happen around our screen. What I mentioned in my remarks was 62% electronic in the quarter, which is up from 55% in the prior year. So that's really the story. What we -- our strategy has been and remained is to stay relevant, to stay a leader in the key products in that field and then as the SEF definitions develop as the electronifications continue to merge the very strong voice broker business we've got with our very strong technology background to position us, as the SEFs start to take off, as that market starts to recover. So overall the CDS business was a slight contributor to growth in the quarter, and we feel very good strategically about where we're positioned if that market starts to turn.","Operator","Our next question comes from Howard Chen with Credit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Jeff, with respect to BRIX, you noted the early success and having signed on approximately 100 clients. Is that better or worse than you'd hope for? And how are you and how should we be benchmarking in the success there?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","It's amazingly great. We went into a market that was not developed at all and helped to organize standard contracts, standard trading agreements, and now electronic transparency. There were a lot of people that were resistant to that change because they made money under the old system. So the fact that it has so quickly taken hold, I think, is just amazing. What we're doing right now is trading physical electric power between market participants that have supply and demand electric power. That market will we believe grow and we can take the indices that we're now producing, which are increasingly being viewed as the market price and help the market create derivatives around those that would be cash settled and ultimately cleared. So that is the trend of that business. It follows the trend of what we did in the United States in the early days of ICE. But I would tell you that it's moving very, very quickly, and it seems to becoming institutionalized very quickly. It gives us some confidence as we move -- as we work with Cetip on a similar vein in the fixed income and bond markets that we, hopefully, will see similar success, particularly given that Cetip was a fixed income bank and dealer consortium and as its formation and those people are very close to the company, and many of them are still in the boardroom. And so working with Cetip management on exactly how that market will evolve. So we have high hopes for Brazil, and it's been a very good emerging market for us.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And my follow up, you all continue to be pretty constructive on the organic opportunity set for ICE. Can you just talk about how you're seeing the M&A landscape today? And what's your appetite to do a sizable acquisition?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Ah, what do I say? We're sitting on a lot of cash, and we have very high expectations for when we invest cash on behalf of our shareholders, that it should have a significant return. And if we can't find those opportunities, then we owe it to our shareholders to return the capital so that they can go find significant returns. And so that's how we're thinking about it. I have suggested to past earnings calls that I think there's a number of assets in the markets that have been mispriced. We're starting to see some pricing -- downside pricing pressure on certain public companies. We're starting to see the market really thinking seriously about financial reform and what really is a swap execution facility and who really is going to be able to clear OTC business and what are the swaps data repositories and what types are really going to get used as the OTC markets migrate onto a more transparent platform. So you're starting to see a rationalization in price, which I suggested that you would see. And I think there's a ways to go on some companies yet. And so we think there maybe opportunities. I think there were companies that were mispriced for the upside and the expectations, there may be companies mispriced that downside at certain moments in time, and we would like to be opportunistic if those opportunities came along. Otherwise, we will return the capital and we're letting that play out.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Allen with Evercore.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. One, just on the NDF FX clearing which you launched now with CME. Do you see other opportunities within FX for clearing? Or is it -- that can be somewhat limited because of the existence of the CLS Bank over time?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, that's a very good question, and I think the market itself is trying to figure that out. The initial part of the market will be NDFs and options, which right now are specifically required by Dodd-Frank. The Fed under Dodd-Frank exempted a large part of the cash market from being cleared under Dodd-Frank. But I shouldn't say that they put out a paper suggesting they would exempt it, and there's still a lot of debate and discussion about whether or not government itself is going to push more of the FX market in the clearing. I think, there's obviously a debate going on in Europe about the FX markets and the OTC markets in general and how they will be traded and cleared. And so we would expect for that to become more known over the next year, and it may possibly include larger segments of the market to be cleared just from a regulatory perspective. Taking regulation off the table, as people become more capital constrained, as efficiencies in clearinghouses are continued to be developed, particularly with things like Scott talking about on portfolio margining, fine tuning of credit models, which we've been doing in our CDS clearinghouse and the like. I think there's going to be a trend towards more clearing from a voluntary standpoint. And you may see a broadening of the footprint of FX. And I think CLS will continue to evolve in that case and work very closely with those clearinghouses that are taking on more of that business.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just one follow-up. I mean, looking at your platform, obviously, a lot of growth opportunities within the existing product set, and it provides nice balances you saw on the first quarter, now again in April. I mean, how do you think about the growth opportunities organically within your existing asset classes? Or do you think there's a need to expand to other asset classes to provide additional balance and growth over the long term?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","It's a good question. Because we're a public company and because we're owned by shareholders that expect us to grow, the reason that the word \"growth\" is mentioned in our prepared script a number of times is very calculated because it's on the mindset of us as managers, that we have an obligation to seek out growth for our owners. And so we do think that our core business is really got a lot of continued opportunities. These commodity markets are some of the oldest trading markets in the world, and they have customs and practices that date back for hundreds of years. And so changing behavior is a slow process. And, however, you can see the trend for the more than 10 years that we've been at it continues to grow. But then we do look at where do we have a footprint geographically, where do we have customer relationships, where do we have technology, where are our competitors missing opportunities that we could differentiate ourselves. We have the luxury of being -- of growing the top and bottom line right now. And so we are investing in a lot of new initiatives, and some will be successful and some I suspect will not. And -- however, that's the way entrepreneurship works. And so we do have a lot of other asset classes, a lot of other geographies, a lot of other technologies -- like moving into the bonds business, for example -- that we think we can exploit. And we have the luxury to do that, and I suspect that our shareholders are demanding that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Niamh Alexander with KBW.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","On the ICE Clear Credit, thank you for the clarification. Jeff, you said expect earlier you expect ICE Clear Credit to be systemically important. Can you expand a little bit more on how should we think about that, maybe from additional capital to -- do you expect that there'll be some liquidity ratios? Is it going to be ICE Clear Credit, specifically that entity? Or would there be some implications for ICE Group as well in terms of financial limitations?","Scott A. Hill","Yes, I think, Niamh, that that -- some of that is still yet to be decided in terms of what it would mean to be a SIFI. I think some of the things that are fairly clear is an expectation that you'll be able to cover for the simultaneous default of the 2 largest clearing members, which we've already done; an expectation that you'll have a relatively cash-oriented set of margin and guaranteed fund holdings, which we've already got; that you'll have to manage towards a 5-day holding period, which we already do; and then I think to your question, our expectation is it will be entity-specific, so it would be ICE Clear Credit. But we feel like we've got a trial run of what being a SIFI would mean as we launched ICE Trust under the supervision of the Fed a few years ago. And then what that basically meant was not only were they interested in the specifics of how ICE Trust was run, now ICE Clear Credit, but they were also interested in the corporate services that were provided to ICE Trust. What's your disaster recovery plan? What's your business continuity plan? What's your internal audit plan? And so we had a number of discussion under that review that were really specific to the corporation. So I don't think there's any ICE level capital requirement that's likely to exist. As I said, there's still not full clarity with regards to what additional liquidity or capital may be required. There will be more operational capital that's required. We've already moved from 6 to 12 months. So we're really already there. But again, I don't think it will bleed too much into the corporate level from a capital standpoint, but from a business process, this business control standpoint, there's no question that the supervision will look through into the providers of that service, which is the parent.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Niamh, [indiscernible] I know this is a scenario that you are interested in from hearing you on other calls and other notes. One thing about ICE is that I have never let Scott have this company be rated and I've never let the company issue public debt. We could have a lower interest rate component in this company if we did, but because we run clearinghouses, I personally think it's a bad idea. The ratings agencies do look at the subsidiaries in rating the parent. We can argue whether that's fair or not. But as a result of that, we have not wanted to put our corporate debt at risk. And so all of the debt that we've done to date has been through the banks, and that's what we continue to do.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","That was very helpful. I appreciate the color there. I guess, talking about debt and cash capital on a different subject. Help me think about how do you appeal to targeted acquisition shareholders, maybe when there is a bigger, more expensive, more cash-rich buyer? How do you go about appealing there, concerning that -- well, you have your bank debt line but maybe you don't want to pay as much, but you have certainly other things to offer.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","That's a good question. I think generally speaking, you've seen a lot of failed acquisitions in the past couple of years, where not every constituent was considered in putting the deals together. And constituents mean not just shareholders but customers and regulators. And so we've been very good and very thoughtful about -- the deals we've done, about threading the needle and finding a balance between rewarding the target's shareholders but also making sure that the end-users of the businesses and the regulators and our shareholders also have upside. And that's the challenge and the skill, I guess, of being successful in M&A. Certainly, there are businesses where the high price is the winner, but those tend to not be businesses that ICE goes after. We tend to go after businesses where our opportunity set in terms of providing technology, in terms of providing clearing, in terms of providing global regulatory support and distribution, are meaningful to the companies that we acquire.","Scott A. Hill","It's interesting, Niamh. I spent a number of years at IBM looking at acquisitions, and what tended to happen there is you go in, you buy the company, you'd integrate the product and you basically -- and the people who sold it, all they want are the top dollars so they could go and build something else that maybe IBM would buy later. In the case of most of the acquisitions we do, a lot of the people who are owners and sellers expect to continue to operate in those markets post-acquisition. So while price is important, the ability to bring clearing capabilities to the table, the ability to bring global distribution of your platform to the table, the ability to bring technology innovation to the table, all those things matter because the day they get the check for the deals that's been done, the very next day, they're back in those markets trading. And they want to know that they've got a good market operator. So as opposed to others who could write a bigger check, we feel like we're better innovators and we're better market operators. And that's an advantage that we think differentiates us in any deal.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with ISI Group.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Jeff, can you comment a little bit more on the Brent\/TI market share? Your share's now pretty close to 50% of the crude oil market, if you just look at the 2 contracts, up from about 30% a little over a year ago. If you can talk about sort of the near and intermediate-term direction of where you think that might go, given the CLE [ph] pipeline and the potential narrowing of the spread. And also how high-frequency trading plays a role? I believe the WTI contract's a little bit more -- has more algorithmic participation versus the more commercially used Brent?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Sure. Those are very good questions, and they are things that we think about here. The last month may have actually been a tipping point in the Brent\/TI world. We saw Brent really out-trade WTI at our competitor for the first time on a sustained basis. We have seen the ultimate end-user, the hedger, continually moving towards Brent. We've, obviously, been targeting them with marketing. We have for years, but it's really been paying dividends in the last year or so. And there was no options market on Brent, for example, a year ago. And today, we have over 1 million open interest in Brent options. We have -- I have for years been seeing we've been building options trading technology. We rolled that out in earnest about the beginning of this year, and the results are amazing. And so it's pulling that portion of oil trading away from WTI to Brent. We benefit by having Brent and WTI in one clearinghouse for those people that trade the Brent\/TI spread. That trade has been broken for quite some time. You've got to have big goals if you are going to be trading the Brent\/TI spread because that can move against you very, very quickly. I think the reversal in the pipeline will help bring that spread back into some sense of normalcy. But the pipeline does not have the capacity in it to really bring that market back into what was historical norms. So we expect significant volatility, and we are not sure that we're going to see a lot of Brent\/TI spread traders come back into that market. We'll see, but it's not our expectation. If it does, it will benefit us. But Brent is just growing on its own. And one of the things -- one of the lessons that you could see with respect to algorithmic trading and looking at other markets is that algorithmic traders trading against algorithmic traders is a 0-sum game, and eventually they get tired of losing money to each other and they go away. And so as you move the ultimate users out of the market, algorithmic traders eventually leave as well. And so we have never built a business that is dependent on algorithmic trading. We've never thought that selling co-location services was a good long, sustainable market. It's important that we allow co-location and facilitate it. But trying to profit from it, we've never believed in. I don't believe in selling technology services to algorithmic traders. I believe that they are going to go on into the world and find the best, and in many cases, develop their own. So those are just areas that we have avoided that some of our competitors have not, and I think you see the difference in our growth right now. And lastly, Chuck Vice, who sits quietly next to me on each of these earnings calls, has a team of people that study our markets. And we watch how the markets operate. And we put ourselves in the shoes of the customer that was in the market, and we want to make sure that people have a good experience. So we have introduced algorithmic trading all across our markets, but we've done so in a very thoughtful way, in a way that the algos can make money but also actually provide true liquidity that the ultimate hedger would benefit from. And that mix seems to be driving -- continue to drive people into our markets. So I'm quite proud of the work that Chuck and his colleagues have done. But I think that kind of -- I think that work will be adopted in other markets over time because it is working.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great. Maybe just my follow-up on capital allocation. Obviously, if a large deal doesn't come through, and you alluded to a number of other potential smaller acquisition opportunities, given pricing, maybe if you can just talk about how you would view that against potentially establishing a dividend. It sounds, of course, as a growth company that that might be off the table. Maybe if you can just sort of confirm that for now. And then in terms of organic initiatives, how should we view thinking about ICE potentially at some point in the future entering interest rate swap clearing?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Two tough questions. First of all, on the return of capital, I think the company does do share buybacks. We don't view share buybacks at any price as a return of capital of buying your stock at a price above where it trades. It looks like a disruption of capital to me. So we are thoughtful about the way we return capital through share buybacks, and we run our own stock through our own models, and we make the assumption that we're buying our own stock like we would buy any other company's stock. And so we look for when it is mispriced to the downside, and it does from time to time, as you know, because it is a market. We haven't crossed the bridge yet of how and when we'll return additional capital. I think we can typically -- we visit this topic at every board meeting that we have. But as long as we continue to see opportunities to reinvest at significant rates, our large shareholders, who we have a very good dialogue with, have told us that they would -- if we can find those opportunities, they will support us in those opportunities, and so we continue to look for them. In terms of interest rate clearing, there's a lot of competition in that space. Obviously, you see the London clearinghouse with IDCG doing deals to bolster their U.S. clearing presence. And there are other competitors in that space. And generally the rates that people are paying for clearing are quite low. So it is a large asset class but a lot of competition at very low rates at this point in time. It's not clear yet whether or not the market wants a multi-asset class clearing facility. We have seen that -- in the initiatives that we've done that large clearing firms prefer to have separated default funds, and they don't want these things co-mingled. So the market has been willing and wanting to pay more to create circuit breakers between asset classes. And as we go back to Niamh's question about clearinghouses, and I think you're going to see the systemically important issues roll through in the U.S. -- and the Bank of England is looking at similar kinds of things in the U.K. -- the whole Treasury area and how you prevent this stuff from being contagious is going to be a focus. And so we're trying to build our clearing infrastructure on an asset-class-by-asset-class basis with different rules, different funds, different risk models, different risk members and cordon them off as best we can.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I want to just follow-up on, I think, Richard's question at the beginning on the OTC business in April. I wanted really more flavor on OTC power and OTC oil activity. Gas volumes still seem good in April, obviously, not as good as January and February, but it would suggest that power and oil have fallen off somewhat. So what's happening in those products, maybe not just in April, but what's the trend and why?","Scott A. Hill","Yes, Kenneth. I think we continue to see the oil performance being pretty good. Power has been soft and, frankly, remain soft today. And we've seen decent volume growth, but it's really been more of a shift into some of the mini-contracts that are trading that's driving that volume growth. We've seen decent uptick across all the products and options activity, which has been good. Natural gas is okay. The growth in April was modest, up a little bit versus last year. And again, I think it's not dissimilar than the contributions you saw in the first quarter. Natural gas contribute a little bit, but it's growth was a bit slower. Oil contributed a little bit, and power remains soft. So I don't think we really saw anything in April that's all that different than what we saw in the first quarter, other than what Jeff alluded to, the massive shift in the paradigm of natural gas prices and people resetting their positions. I mean, the one good thing we haven't talked about that we did see in the first quarter, in addition to the growth, was a significant build in open interest. And so despite the fact that April was a little bit slower, with not a whole lot of big price movements on the upside, we do have customers who have re-established very meaningful open interest positions at these new lower prices. And so to the extent you do start to see whether events or other things that create volatility, there are large risk positions that are on that people need to trade it around. So I feel pretty good about where natural gas is headed in April, directly to your question. I don't think the dynamics were all that different than what we saw in the first quarter other than the big slowdown in nat gas.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And on market data, I think, you had exchange fees went up from $65 to $75 per user per month. How much capacity is there for more of this type of increase? And I don't know if you give this off, but I'll just ask it anyway. Screen count. Where does screen count stand today versus a year ago?","Scott A. Hill","Screen count, Ken -- We don't put it out. So I can't give you a specific number. But I've talked about it trend-wise a number of times. And if I can look at the screen count today, it's up from where it was a year ago. It's up significantly from when I started 5 years ago, and it's been a steady trend. As the economic cycle dips, screen count continue to grow. You guys know in your firms the first thing people do, or at least, I used to do at IBM and still do here at ICE, when times get tough, get rid of your Bloomberg screen, get rid of your Reuters screen. I'm sure that mandate is going out with regards to your ICE screens, and it doesn't happen. We do see attrition, but we see growth that offsets it. So screens are higher than they were a year ago. Screens are higher than they were 2 years ago, 3 years ago, and it's been a steady uptick. So our expectation, as I said earlier, is that market data revenues will continue to perform well. In terms of what capacity we have for price increases, that all relates to what the customer demand level -- what are the new offerings we can introduce into our data packages, et cetera. So we're pricing to what the market wants in terms of the products. So yes, I would be reluctant to try and guess at what and when the next price increase might be. But I think, again, you've seen -- you talked about $65 going to $75, $55 went to $65. So we consistently look to make sure that the price is reflective of the customer demand and the quality of the products that we're selling.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just one on the expenses. In terms of the acquisition-related costs, is it more, meaning in terms of that line item and having the expense this quarter, next quarter. Like, should it be ongoing, meaning that it's a core piece of the business? Or that -- just currently, you're doing a lot more in that area versus what you did historically and maybe with other G&A, and so you're trying to break that out? Just trying to get a sense on -- I know you're trying to say that it's core, but is it just at an elevated level currently versus kind of the long-term run rate?","Scott A. Hill","I think fundamentally what it gets down to is we have consistently said that M&A as a part of the growth strategy that we've got. It's not a strategy, M&A is not a strategy. But it is a part of how we expect to grow. And so for us to exclude what I'll call core M&A-type spending, whether it's legal fees or banker fees or things like that, that's just a part of the business. When you're in a collaborative [ph], you're going to spend money on lawyers to write deals. You're going to spend money on accounting firms to due diligence. And that's simply a fundamental part of our expense. What we will continue to do is note on a non-GAAP basis in any large single charges that are made. So, for example, as you guys know, a lot of times the banking agreements are at single success fees. And so if we've got a $2 million or $5 million or $8 million success fee, somewhere to what we did around Cetip last year, or a single one-off large fee for a banking line, similar to what we had around the NYX deal last year, we will continue to point those out because those are unusual. They're not reflective of the run rate in the core business. But the overall M&A business it's just -- it's something we do. And so continue to pull that out and say, \"Don't look at that. Don't pay attention to that,\" frankly, I think, would be a bit disingenuous. So what we're trying to do is give you a fair reflection of what we believe the core expenses are that support our ability to grow the top line. These M&A expenses are part of that. And I'll note with those expenses included, 62% margins and 67% margins, if you would pull the brokerage business out. So it's a part of the core expenses. It is a bit of a change. But I think it's a change more reflective of the business we manage.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just on the U.S. business, on the ag products, the pricing change at the beginning of the year. I guess, one is, pushback. It seems like you're gaining traction in terms of new products. Probably not, but did that go as expected? And anything on the horizon there?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Yes, there was almost literally no pushback at all. And I think there really are 3 primary reasons for that. Number one, with the price increase, we're still very competitive within the other exchange -- similar exchange-traded products out there. So it was really a change that got us more in line, did not take us above where our competitors are. I think the second reason there wasn't a lot of pushback is because I do believe that people that trade the ag products on NYBOT do look back at where they were 5 years ago and where they are today and recognize better clearing technology, better clearing services, better trading technologies. The fact that an electronic option exists 5 years later is something that they value. So I think they do recognize that those improvements along with some of the additional compliance costs that we're incurring, it's not unreasonable to look at price increases. And then I think the third factor, if you think about why the price increase I think resonates with people is, frankly, the product offering that we have, the customer relationships we have and the commercial nature of those customers, what they want are deep liquid markets. And when we create product offerings, better technology that makes those -- the bid offer tighter, that makes the liquidity pool deeper, that adds in options trading on an electronic basis, if those commercial customers are trading in a market that is better for them. And so, again, I think they're relatively as sanguine as any customer about the pricing increase, willing to accept that price increase. So no meaningful pushback at all, and I think largely because of the reasons I just mentioned.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jillian Miller with BMO Capital Markets.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","The agreement to partner with Cetip to create the OTC fixed income trading venue. I just want to get a little more color on what's the targeted customer base there. Is it dealer to client, dealer to dealer, some kind of combination? What kind of void are you filling in the market? And then maybe you could give us an idea for how the Partnership's working financially? I think you alluded to this earlier, but I assume that technology licensing, you're going to have some kind of -- a profit-sharing or some way you can actually benefit from increases and activity levels on the platform?","Scott A. Hill","Yes, so we haven't put out any -- really disclosed any information with regards to the financial terms of the deal, Jillian. So I'll be reluctant to put that out now. Suffice to say that the deal structure will not be dissimilar than others that you've seen what we've done ventures with other firms to build platforms and provide technology. In terms of the market opportunity, there is not really in Brazil any meaningful platform for the electronic trading of fixed income instruments, but there is a desire by the customers in Brazil for that opportunity. So we've had, as you would expect, before we go into any initiative, a number of conversations with customers in Brazil. One of the reasons we made the investment in Cetip and got onto the board is because we wanted to build the relationship with the banks and other large global customers in Brazil. We've done that, and as we've done that, in that dialogue, particularly Dave Goone, who's our Chief Strategy Officer, and he's a board member on Cetip, he sat with each of those banks on a number of occasions. And one of the consistent themes that we've heard is, \"We would like a more efficient way to trade fixed income instruments.\" There are other competitors who are trying to move into Brazil and do that, who are focused more on the client-side, which is important, but it's not where the real depth in the market is today. The real depth in the market is among similar -- not dissimilar to most other markets, the large financial institutions, the large banks. And those customers are telling us that they think an electronic platform is important and necessary, may look at the electronic platform we run for Creditex. They look at our bond platform that we've got. And we, frankly, were a natural partner to come down and develop that along with Cetip. So I would characterize the demand is being the large financial institutions and banks, where the vast majority of those products trade today, looking for a not, again, dissimilar than a lot of markets we've entered, looking for a more efficient means of trading. And the platform we will build for them will create that more efficient opportunity for them to trade.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. That's helpful. And then the FX OTC, you said that one of the reasons why you're not kind of jumping into the interest rate swap clearing is because it's very competitive. But it just seems to me like kind of the same players are going into FX. You've seen CME and LCH both kind of making moves there. So I guess, I'm wondering what's different in the FX market? Why do you think you have a competitive advantage there or there's I guess a better opportunity for you there?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","I think the reason is we have 10 of the largest players who've made a commitment to use our platform, so it was kind of a -- once that was agreed, it became a bit of a no-brainer. And not only did they agree to use the platform, they gave us broad access to technology people and back office people to design an infrastructure that works for the way they trade and makes it easy to get these trades into a clearinghouse. The -- and I think I'll just leave it at that. We tend not to believe in the field of dreams and build and hope they will come. We tend to try to work with customers and find out what their real needs are and then work with them to build something that we know they'll need. And in the case of FX clearing, we really feel pretty good about the offering that we've designed.","Operator","The next question comes from Rob Rutschow with CLSA.","Rob Rutschow - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I guess I had a couple of questions on OTC. First, I think one of your brokers that trades OTC products suggested that you saw better trading in OTC power options this quarter, I think, and those had been sort of sluggish in previous quarters. So I wonder if you could confirm that. And then second, the percentage that you're returning to your customers in terms of rebates on the OTC side has increased from around 20% last year in the first quarter to close to 40% this quarter. So is the rebate a function of volume and revenue? So as volume and revenue go up, so does the rebate percentage? Or should we think about that as kind of one-off or your looking to drive adoption in some new products?","Scott A. Hill","So let me start with the rebate part of the question and then maybe we could talk a little bit about the new options. From a rebate standpoint, you shouldn't expect that the percentage will go up because volumes and revenue go up. Typically, what drives the rebate percentage up is really one of 2 things. One is you get into a particularly volatile period. In that volatility you tend to see more market makers move into the markets, which drives the rebate percentage higher. Unfortunately, for power, that hadn't been the case. We haven't seen a lot of volatility in those markets. The other time that you tend to see in the OTC market and really, the futures markets as well, the market maker percentages increase is when you're really trying to get new products launched, whether it's options or any sort of new product, you need to get market makers in those markets early making markets. So Jeff's point, if 2 months, 3 months, 8 months later, if only market makers, those markets don't survive. But in early days, if you want to get liquidity growing, you needed to go get those market makers in. And so what I think you're seeing a little bit is as we establish more new markets in OTC, particularly around option, we're trying to bring more market makers in to get the liquidity building. As that liquidity builds, it attracts commercials who may be trading a different product that's somewhat less correlated or slightly different. And then they start to see the depth of liquidity in the new product and decide, \"Okay, the bid offer's tighten enough. The liquidity is deepen enough. I now want to move into those markets.\" So over time, I think you'll see that normalize. Over longer periods, the rebate percentage ought to stay relatively constant. But again, as we're developing new markets you do on occasion see it tick up a little bit more. With regards to options, as Jeff alluded to, that's been a key strategy for us over the past, really 3 years. And we bought Yellow Jacket back in 2009, and when we did that deal, we announced that the real driver behind it was we did not believe anyone in our space had come up with a great way of enabling trading for options electronically. As we sit here today, that's no longer the case. We've announced a number of new options products in power, in gas, in oil, on the futures side, on the OTC side and on the ag side. And all of that has been enabled by the investments that we've made in technology. So you do see an industry typically in less volatile, maybe lower liquidity times, trade a bit more on the option side. And again, I think that's what you're seeing in power right now. New products, better technology, maybe a little less volatile market. And that's helping the overall options volume on the power side.","Operator","And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to ICE for closing remarks.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Thank you, operator, and I guess I hope this call helps clarify the ways in which we've grown last quarter and outline some of the initiatives we have that are going to allow us to continue to grow in the future. We'll look forward to hearing from you throughout the quarter, and we'll update you on our progress as we go. And thank you all for joining us today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day."],"11969":["IntercontinentalExchange Group (NYSE:ICE) Q3 2014 Earnings Call November  4, 2014  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Kelly L.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kelly Loeffler. Please go ahead.","Kelly L. Loeffler","Good morning. ICE's third quarter 2014 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of theice.com. These items will be archived, and our call will be available for replay.","Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2013 Form 10-K.","In addition to GAAP results, we also refer to non-GAAP measures, including adjusted income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted expenses, adjusted debt to EBITDA and adjusted EPS. These measures adjust GAAP results for extraordinary items, including nonoperating impacts of our acquisitions. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our core performance. You'll find the reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP term in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful as well as how management uses these measures. Net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses.","Adjusted net income refers to adjusted net income from continuing operations, and adjusted EPS refers to adjusted diluted continuing operations earnings per share.","With us on the call are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Chuck Vice, President and Chief Operating Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Scott.","Scott A. Hill","Thank you, Kelly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. I'll begin on Slide 4, where you can see our performance for the first 9 months of 2014. ICE's adjusted earnings per share rose 5% year-to-year to $6.53. Through September, our adjusted operating margin stands at 50%. We have generated record operating cash flows of $922 million, and consolidated net revenues were $2.3 billion.","Notably, we delivered these results despite low volatility, which resulted in futures volumes declining 17% year-to-year. Regardless of the challenging volumes, open interest levels are up, revenues have remained stable, we are on track to achieve nearly 50% of our synergy target in 2014, we've expanded margins from 45% to 50% and we've grown earnings.","In addition, the record levels of cash we have generated, combined with the divestment of nonstrategic businesses, has enabled us to sharpen our strategic focus, delever and return over $700 million of capital to shareholders. And importantly, our October volumes demonstrate once again what happens when open interest levels are increasing and volatility returns.","Please turn to Slide 5, where I will highlight our third quarter results. Consolidated net revenues were $745 million, adjusted operating expenses were $377 million and adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 49%. Adjusted net income was $245 million, and adjusted earnings per share rose 9% to $2.15 per share versus $1.97 in the prior third quarter. And of note, we have now repurchased 2% of the total shares outstanding at the time the NYSE acquisition was closed.","Let's move to Slide 6, where I'll detail third quarter revenues and expenses. On the left side, you can see that net transaction and clearing revenues totaled $447 million. Market data revenues, as expected, bounced back from a dip in the second quarter largely related to the Euronext separation and totaled $105 million. Our data revenues also benefited from continued growth in our subscriber base and additional value capture from our enhanced data offerings. This sustained demand for market data indicates continued interest in our diverse markets despite a cyclical downturn in trading volume.","Our listings revenues generated a record $86 million, which was up 11% compared to the prior third quarter on a pro forma basis. And finally, other revenue contributed $107 million in the third quarter.","The right side of Slide 6 shows our expense detail. Third quarter adjusted expenses were $377 million. We came in better than our prior expense guidance, primarily reflected in lower compensation expenses due to 3 factors: first, compensation expense was lower by roughly $3.5 million due to some clean-up related to the Euronext separation; second, we recorded a year-to-date true-up of about $3.5 million related to our performance-based bonus accrual to reflect our expectation that, despite continued growth in earnings, we will come in slightly below our 2014 targets; and finally, and most importantly, we're realizing the cost reductions associated with our integration efforts faster than anticipated. Not only did this help us outperform in 3Q, but it also helped improve our full year expense guidance. And importantly, we expect that momentum to carry into 2015.","Turning now to Slide 7, I'll detail our derivatives revenue and volumes for the third quarter. Total futures and options revenue was $320 million, with our oil and ag complexes each generating solid growth. Despite a 13% decline in daily volume compared to the prior third quarter, open interest increased 2% from the end of the year to 76 million contracts.","Both Brent and other oil open interest are at record levels, up 26% and 21%, respectively, from the start of the year. Ags and equity derivatives open interest were up 3% and 33%, respectively.","Interest rate open interest was flat through the end of September but increased in October. While activity in our North American natural gas markets remains muted, total natural gas revenues were basically flat thanks to the solid trends in our European natural gas markets.","Moving next to Slide 8, we highlight the notable improvements in our October volumes. While one month does not necessarily indicate a trend, you can certainly see what the combination of increased NOI and a return to a more normal ag volatility environment can do to improve trading activity. Total volume for the month was flat year-over-year with continued significant declines in Euribor volumes, offset by strength in Brent, other oil, Sterling, Gilt, other ag and equity indices. Brent ADV was up 28% over the prior October, driven by oil price volatility as oil prices go to levels not seen since 2012. Other oil ADV increased 20% in October, benefiting from both volatility and new products we continue to introduce to complement our Brent complex.","Our Sterling and Gilt average daily volumes were up 62% and 60%, respectively, compared to the prior October due to improving economic sentiment in the U.K. Other ags were up 10%, and equity indices were up 50% compared to the previous October.","In addition to the growth across many of our derivatives products, our U.S. cash equities volumes also grew 32% in October, driven by volatility in equity markets, with market share up nearly 2 percentage points to 23.9%. We'll provide more details in our October volume release, which will be issued tomorrow morning.","Let's now continue with our credit derivatives markets on Slide 9. CDS revenues were $38 million in the third quarter, including clearing revenues, which increased 3% to $23 million. Over the first 9 months of 2014, we continued to enhance our cleared product set, including clearing for the Markit iTraxx Senior Financial CDS Index and various prominent CDS instruments.","It's worth noting that through September, 40% of the $4.9 trillion of buy-side gross notional cleared comes from European buy-side customers clearing through ICE Clear Credit, our U.S. CDS clearinghouse. This trend is happening as a result of the regulatory uncertainty in Europe; the Brent products that we uniquely offer, including all major indices, all constituent single names and a multitude of sovereign CDS products; and the capital efficiency that we are uniquely able to provide via our portfolio margining capabilities. Importantly, this business is now on track to deliver just under $100 million of revenue in 2014, and it is contributing meaningfully to our bottom line.","Please turn to Slide 10, and I'll walk through our NYSE business. On the trading side, we are peeling back layers of complexity and opening up the exchange for the benefit of issuers and investors, which will ultimately benefit the trading environment. And amid these efforts, NYSE's market share has notably strengthened and our revenue capture remains solid. We continue to work to enhance our equities trading business to better serve customers and to operate more efficiently in order to generate increased profitability and cash flows.","We're also making investments to improve our corporate services offering to leverage the strength of the NYSE brand and our strong customer relationships. Stacey Cunningham, formally a leader of our equities business, has been appointed as President of NYSE Governance Services to help lead our efforts. And just last week, we acquired a small innovative technology business to further enhance our role as thought leaders in the governance, risk and compliance space.","Moving to the bottom of Slide 10, the lower left graph clearly reflects the New York Stock Exchange's continued leadership in global listings. In the third quarter, we had a record 29 IPOs and raised a record $37 billion. And even without the Alibaba IPO, the capital raised on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange was greater than the next 4 listing venues combined. The NYSE's hybrid market model and transparent IPO platform continues to attract companies of all sizes and industries from around the globe. Our IPO pace is trending well above 2013, and we remain on track for our third consecutive record year in technology IPOs. We are making solid progress at the NYSE, and we are optimistic about 2015.","Now let's talk about our strong cash flows and capital structure on Slide 11. Operating cash flows grew to a record $922 million in the first 9 months of the year. At September 30, we had over $650 million in unrestricted cash and short-term investment, excluding the $1.2 billion set aside for the repayment of our euro notes in June 2015.","We used our strong cash generation for strategic growth investments and to return over $700 million to our shareholders through October. Year-to-date, we have paid $225 million in dividends, and this morning, we announced a fourth quarter dividend of $0.65 per share. We repurchased over $500 million in ICE stock through October and have over $500 million left in our current repurchase authorization.","We also announced 2 strategic acquisitions in the quarter, SuperDerivatives and the Holland Clearing House, which will accelerate our growth initiatives related to clearing and data services. We closed on SuperDerivatives in October and expect to close on the Holland Clearing House during the fourth quarter.","Total net debt, which reflects cash set aside to repay the euro notes, was $2.9 billion, and our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio was 1.6x. As we mentioned during last quarter's call, we may move around our leverage target temporarily based on the cash flow of the business, credit rating considerations, the timing of strategic investment opportunities and our capital return program.","I'll wrap up my remarks on Slide 12 with an update on our financial reporting and guidance. As ICE continues to build its earning power and expand its cash generation, we want to provide our shareholders with greater clarity regarding the financial strength of our business. Therefore, starting in the fourth quarter, we will report our adjusted earnings per share excluding expenses related to the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. To help with the transition, we have provided you with the first 3 quarters of 2014 on this basis on Slide 26 in the appendix of the presentation.","In addition, as we have historically, we will continue to provide an annual view of the return on invested capital metric to demonstrate the impact on shareholder value of the capital we've invested. We believe the combination of the new adjusted EPS measure and the continued use of ROIC as a key metric will further enhance the transparency of our financial reporting.","Also, please note that we have provided separate guidance related to SuperDerivatives. As you can see on the chart, we expect SuperDerivatives will contribute between $15 million and $16 million to revenue, which we expect to be primarily in the market data revenue lines, and it will add $12 million to $13 million in expenses during the fourth quarter, including roughly $8 million to $9 million in compensation expense.","We are already collaborating with the SuperDerivatives team to integrate common corporate functions and, far more importantly, to develop the strategic initiatives that will generate revenue growth across our clearing and data businesses.","Finally, I want to provide an update on our NYSE expense synergies. By the end of 2014, we expect to achieve approximately $265 million in synergies, 10% better than what we showed you during our last earnings call and nearly 50% of the way towards our total $550 million synergy objective.","So in summary, despite a double-digit decline in volumes over the first 9 months of 2014, synergy realization has accelerated, earnings have grown, operating cash flows were at record levels, we returned significant capital to our shareholders, and we made solid progress on key integration and growth initiatives. We remained focused on the needs of our customers. We enhanced our product mix and diversification, and we delivered record listings and market data results.","I'll be happy to answer any questions during Q&A, and now I'll hand the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Thank you, Scott, and good morning. The solid results that Scott just reviewed are the result of significant progress on the NYSE integration and on executing across many growth initiatives.","In the third quarter, we grew earnings despite double-digit declines in futures volumes, so you can see that trading volume alone is not a proxy for our earnings performance and that our expense discipline continues to drive solid results.","Through our strategic focus, our mix of business is improving as we rightsize the company and position it for the future. Since Scott just provided an update on synergies, I'll begin on Slide 13 with an update on our time line for further integration. We've accomplished a lot in just 3 quarters, and we continue to execute at or ahead of schedule. Since closing the NYSE transaction, we divested technology businesses, operationally and financially separated Euronext and Liffe and divested Euronext through a successful IPO. And we're on track to end the year with nearly 50% of our synergy expenses achieved. Four of the 5 scheduled phases of the Liffe exchange transition have already seamlessly been completed, with the last one scheduled to occur in a few weeks. This European initiative follows the earlier transition of the Liffe U.S. markets to ICE's futures exchanges over the summer.","In addition to migrating customers from one trading platform to another, we developed a new matching engine for our interest rate markets, which is based on Liffe's popular trade-matching algorithm. Completing the move of Liffe products will further enhance our progress with synergies, which we expect to be fully reflected in our first quarter 2015 run rate. We've received positive customer feedback regarding the transition, and we continue to expand our client-facing team to better serve these customers.","I want to thank our Liffe exchange customers for their engagement in the successful transition and for their helpful feedback.","Let's move to Slide 14, where I'll discuss our European interest rate complex. Low interest rates across the eurozone continued to negatively impact Euribor futures volume in the third quarter. Excluding Euribor, which comprises about 1\/2 of our interest rate volume, average daily volume was down only 3%, and open interest in these contracts actually rose 47% year-to-date, which is represented by the green line in the chart. Contributing positively to this trend was a 14% increase in Gilt average daily volume for the quarter, which seems to be driven by improving economic sentiment in the U.K. So while average daily volumes in European interest rate contracts declined 31% in the third quarter, the related revenue decreased only 17% on a pro forma basis, as you can see in the chart on the right-hand side.","Finally, with October interest rate volume down only 8% and our open interest moving up, we continue to believe that we acquired our interest rate franchise at the bottom of an interest rate cycle.","Turning to Slide 15. You can see that, in addition to the secular trends that have produced annual growth in ICE's Brent crude volume, more volatility due to economic and geopolitical uncertainty also drove volume growth and record open interest. In the third quarter, ICE's Brent average daily volume increased 8% year-on-year, and open interest reached an all-time record of 3.2 million contracts.","In October, Brent volume grew nearly 30% year-to-year to 817,000 contracts per day, so we've started the fourth quarter at a very solid run rate.","And based on the growth in Brent volume, even in light of lower volatility we saw early in 2014 and the payment for order flow schemes offered by our competitors, the long-term relevance of ICE Brent continues to rise. Importantly, in October, ICE's Brent open interest has surpassed NYMEX WTI open interest for the first time in the history of these contracts. This is largely driven by the increased adoption of Brent by commercial customers.","We've also seen a payoff from our focused marketing efforts to make Brent a larger component than WTI in most commodity indexes. The Commitment of Traders report continues to show increasing volumes in our energy markets being held by commercial customers, as we see our competitors adopting incentives that attract the type of algorithmic trading that typically drives commercial users away. Combine that with the capital efficiencies in our clearinghouse across our oil products, totaling more than 400 related futures contracts, and you can see why the customer benefits that ICE provides is increasingly being determined by the cost efficiency of customer collateral rather than simply the price of trade execution.","Turning to Slide 16. North American natural gas volumes remained muted in the third quarter, given low volatility and range-bound prices. However, I want to note that North American volumes in October increased 30% from July's average daily volume and were down just 10% over the prior October, so we're seeing improving activity to start the fourth quarter.","On the right side of the chart, you can see the European markets, and they're driving a favorable mix shift in our gas business overall. With the shift of ICE Endex Exchange onto the ICE platform last year, price transparency has increased, as has liquidity, due to this virtuous trend which attracts more market participants.","As you'll recall, Endex is a business we acquired in the first part of 2013, and it's a great example of how our strategic M&A enables us to stay in front of emerging growth opportunities. In the third quarter, European gas volumes nearly doubled year-to-year and open interest reached 1 million contracts. And we continue to add new products to serve our base of European utility customers who now trade electricity, natural gas and emissions on our integrated trading and clearing platform.","On Slide 17, I'll walk through some of our new initiatives for the coming quarters, all of which relate to offering more risk management tools and building on the value of our data.","Starting with our announcement this morning. We expect to launch ICE Futures and ICE Clear Singapore in March of 2015 with a range of locally relevant products which we'll further announce in the coming weeks.","We've operated an office in Singapore for the past decade, so we're well established there with a very strong team. Demand continues to rise in Asia for risk management and new products, and we're increasingly hearing that our customers want to hold risk under various understandable and manageable regulatory frameworks. We expect to serve their demand, ranging from commodities to financial contracts, all built around the desire for liquidity, clearing, flexibility, global distribution and the capital efficiencies that ICE can uniquely offer.","During the third quarter, we announced the acquisition of a 75% stake in the Holland Clearing House, which we expect to close by the end of this year. This transaction gives us a clearing footprint in Continental Europe, which matches nicely with our similarly Amsterdam-based ICE Endex Exchange. The Holland Clearing House provides clearing services for the Dutch options MTF known as The Order Machine. The Holland Clearing House will enable us to leverage our clearing platform across yet another jurisdiction and can offer flexibility to our customers if the rules around eurozone-based clearing ultimately differ from those in other jurisdictions.","Last but not least, I want to highlight our acquisition of SuperDerivatives. We've long worked with SuperDerivatives, as have many other exchanges and clearinghouses, to support our settlement and clearing activities. We've come to understand and appreciate the breadth of their quantitative valuation services and how this can contribute to improving ICE's already strong risk management capabilities.","SuperDerivatives also provides a very robust low-cost desktop with extensive data across virtually all asset classes. There are a number of avenues to leverage our combined capabilities to expand our risk management infrastructure and our data services.","Turning now to Slide 18. You can see a range of growth drivers and how they fit with the new initiatives that I've just described, all of which support our long-term growth. The takeaway from this slide is that there are a range of opportunities for growth across all of our asset classes and geographies, based on the increasing role of clearing, a return of global volatility to trading, new services to support our clients in meeting their regulatory requirements and the demand for our listings and data businesses. And we have the unique opportunity through our synergies to create additional significant value and solid margin expansion.","ICE has grown earnings consistently for the last decade and remains a growth company. We have continued our strong commitment to product development and expansion of our clearing services by launching over 100 new energy contracts year-to-date. For context, since 2008, when we made significant investments to be in control of our own vertically integrated clearing capabilities, we have introduced more than 1,000 new products. In addition to our geographic reach, we've expanded into benchmarks and into intellectual properties. ICE Benchmark Administration was launched last February, taking over the supervision of the LIBOR benchmark and, most recently, the ISDAFIX benchmarks. ICE Benchmark Administration has worked closely with the industry to evolve these key benchmarks to support confidence and innovation in these products.","As we look to 2015 and beyond, we continue to believe that we can no longer sit in one jurisdiction to serve customers around the world. We've invested to serve local and global markets from the U.S., the U.K., Continental Europe, Canada, Singapore and Brazil. The challenge of differing regulatory environments has resulted in a demand for increased flexibility of jurisdictions when listening to our customers' reactions to the regulatory barriers that they are facing. We continue to anticipate shifts in customer preferences as they respond to regulatory differences across these jurisdictions.","As Scott just pointed out, we've seen a recent uptake of European customers increasingly moving their swaps clearing to the U.S. So it's important for ICE to maintain flexibility in the location of our infrastructure. As always, we're evolving our business to support our customers' requirements.","The New York Stock Exchange continues to lead in global listings, which is yet another growth driver for us. In the past year, I've had the opportunity to work with many business leaders and entrepreneurs, either in their offices around the world or when they visit the New York Stock Exchange at 11 Wall Street. I've experienced firsthand and I've also heard from many new public company managers the emotion that one feels when standing on our balcony and ringing the bell and what it means for their company's ability to invest higher and grow by accessing the best capital markets in the world when becoming a U.S.-listed company. This is why we remain a leading voice in driving further improvements in U.S. market structure. The equity markets fundamentally exist for capital raising and the protection of that capital, and it's our mission to ensure that a company's stock trades in a fair, efficient and transparent manner. As you can see, both our market share of secondary trading and our related revenue capture are doing well. We believe that the NYSE will be a more attractive business with our planned technology enhancements, rightsizing the expense base and by taking a leadership role in market structure change. And I commend SEC Chair White's leadership for helping to focus the current market structure discussions on driving liquidity and transparency back to markets while reducing the inherent risk that is caused by structural complexity.","One year ago, after completing the acquisition of NYSE, we detailed our extensive integration and strategic plans. Today, we've either completed or shown significant progress on these objectives. On Slide 19, you can see that progress on the plans we set out for you, with the green check marks indicating the items that we've completed since our last call.","During the quarter, we also completed 2 acquisitions and announced a third in what will become the company's seventh clearinghouse. At the same time, we returned over $700 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and we have largely completed the successful transition of the Liffe Exchange. As you can see, we've had a very productive 2014.","I'll finish my remarks now on Slide 20 with our commitment to consistently focus on earnings growth and creating value. We're in the business of risk management, where there's growing demand around the world. We maintain our focus on being customer-centric and results-oriented, and these results include earnings growth, increased cash generation and industry innovation.","Before I close, I want to give a special thanks to Edwin Marcial, who's retiring from ICE after leading our technology team. Edwin was one of the 7 original employees that built ICE into the leading global exchange operator that it is today. Among many other accomplishments, Edwin attracted a very strong technology team here to ICE, and this team has been a critical part of our success, and it continues to drive our business forward. All of us here are grateful to our friend Edwin for his many contributions.","And finally, on behalf of everyone at ICE, I want to thank our customers for trusting us with their continued business and for collaborating with us on the many industry changes that are underway.","I'll now ask our operator, Kate, to conduct a question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Rich Repetto from Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I guess the question is for Scott, first on expenses. And I'm just trying to get my arms around the different moving parts here because you've got SuperDerivatives, you've got an increase in the -- sort of the synergies. So I don't know how to frame this, but what do you expect expenses -- you put out the guidance for 4Q. How do you expect that to -- now to be -- look like in 1Q? Will it go down by the synergy amount, the $350 million minus $265 million divided by 4? But then you get SuperDerivatives and you get the bonus accruals, so I think we're getting lost a little bit in the moving parts in the expense picture.","Scott A. Hill","Yes, Rich, look, there are a lot of moving parts, and I'll acknowledge this year has been a little bit bumpy as we've tried to get our arms around it as well. I think that the high-level picture is what I said in my remarks. The synergy realization is accelerating. You see that in the third quarter. You see it in our improved full year guidance. You're going to see it in the first quarter, and you're going to see it in 2014. So we've talked previously about being on a run rate as we hit the first quarter of $350 million. I think that's going to now be north of $380 million. I think, if you look on an absolute basis in 2015, we're going to realize another $135 million or so of synergies. There'll be some incremental investments. I mean, we are going to restore the bonus. We are going to have an increased program with some of our employees. But even if you net out maybe $30 million of incremental investment, that still means our expense base will come down by over $100 million in 2015. As you mentioned, we do have some acquisitions, but any expense we add there is going to be more than compensated by revenue, and that's before we even start to talk about the synergies we think we can generate around those businesses, predominantly growth-related synergies and top line synergies. So as I look at the expense in the fourth quarter and into 2015, we're feeling really good. And frankly, even as we think about our exit rate, we've talked previously about $450 million as we move into '16, I think we're going to be ahead of that number as well. So the headline is the expenses are going to be better. We'll certainly give you more guidance as we enter into 2015 on our fourth quarter earnings call. But I think, for now, we've given you a good view of what we think fourth quarter looks like, and I've given you a few pieces to work with in 2015.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, Scott, that's helpful. I guess my one follow-up, Jeff, would be on the broader picture on, I guess, energy and Brent. And you gave a lot of good information on how strong the bench -- the increasingly strong bench market. But I guess my question is, with oil prices coming down below $80 a barrel, is that a good thing longer term if it stays there? Certainly, if you look at the cash equity markets, when you see prices hit low, you see plenty of volume and volatility, just sort of like you experienced with Brent volumes in October. But it generally isn't good if it stays that way for an extended period of time, so I'm just trying to see what you think of this $80 price. And is it good in the longer term, if crude stays there, for your volumes and so forth?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, the interesting thing about physical commodities, including oil, is that there are always supply and demand consequences, and the market is always reacting to those, and then you throw on top of it acts of God that tend to impact delivery. And so you have natural volatility, which is why our customers hedge. The last time oil prices came down, we set volume records. The market does better for us when there is just volatility in the market. It doesn't matter whether it's volatility to the downside or volatility to the upside. And then as you pointed out, when you get in sustained periods at price lows or price highs and without a lot of volatility, the market kind of settles down again and we don't see as much trading activity. So long story short, we've sat for quite a long time around the $100-barrel level, plus or minus, and we seem to be resetting. So this is a very good trend for us. You lay on top of that macro trends that I mentioned to you, which is just the increased use of Brent ever since this company has been a public company -- and in fact, in our public company roadshow, we talked about how we were going to go out and really market Brent. And we've been doing that for the last decade, and it's paying off. We're -- it's growing in the indexation of the business. The options business, which there was none for Brent, is now a growth driver for us. We've been able to shift commercial customers increasingly to use Brent for hedging, including customers in the U.S. that used to not really think of Brent as a natural hedge, and so all of those macro trends laying on top of the volatility in pricing, which bodes well for us. Last but not least, open interest is growing. That's always a good indicator when the markets are operating, and so it's a good predictor for future volumes for us under these conditions.","Operator","Our next question is from Kenneth Hill from Barclays.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just wanted to talk about the other revenue line. It seems like it's becoming -- or has been your second-biggest line item there. I was just wondering if there are any plans to kind of break out. You've got a number of pieces moving through there, whether they're fees or the technology business, and how we can kind of think about those going forward or at least what your outlook might be for the technology business, in particular going forward.","Scott A. Hill","Yes. So it's a fair question, Ken. The challenge is there's probably 6 or 8 different things that make that $100 million up. So in the scheme of things, $100 million of our $3 billion of revenue is relatively small, and if I broke it out in a lot of detail, we're talking about even smaller numbers. It's network connectivity fees around safety. It's -- I talked a little bit in my prepared remarks about the corporate governance services that we provide. That's embedded in there. So I think we've tried to give you a little bit of guidance in terms of our expectations. Other revenues are going to be relatively stable. We'd certainly come out and be transparent if we thought there was going to be a material up or down move in that line. But generally speaking, they're just -- there are a number of smaller items that make the amount up, and I don't think it would provide a whole lot of value to investors to provide a lot of additional detail.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then on the market data side, we saw a nice bounce-back here in the third quarter. I think some of that was expected, given some recovery of the Liffe market data revenues from 2Q declined. But was any of that related to beginning to monetize more of the Benchmark Administration segment as well?","Scott A. Hill","It wasn't. The market data revenues are really -- it's what you talked about. So we had a little bit of a blip as we worked through the Euronext transition in the second quarter. As we mentioned on the 2Q earnings call, we did expect that to come back, and it did. But what you're really seeing in the market data is we continue to see more people that want ID, more people that want our screen. That trend line continues up for us. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I really think it's indicative of the continued interest in our markets. And so people tend to focus on volumes down 17% or flat volumes, but if you step back and you look at market data trends, if you look at open interest trends, if you look at the number of people who are wanting access to our markets, that's why you get an October when volatility returns and Brent volumes are great and Sterling volumes are great. So it really is about interest in the markets. It's about the data that we're growing and have the ability to package up and sell. And that's another area where, frankly, SuperDerivatives is going to contribute in the future, is the ability to distribute even more data in a more seamless manner. So those are the kind of things that are going to drive that growth line. Make no mistake, the benchmark -- the IBA business is certainly one that, as we move into 2015, we do expect to grow, and I expect you'll see that helping the market data fees as well. But in the quarter, it's really more about the growing interest in our markets.","Operator","The next question is from Ken Worthington of JP Morgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I would like to ask on pricing. So you continue to highlight the difference between volume and revenue growth, and pricing seems to be going higher across a number of products. And obviously, there's some mix changes in FX, but it does seem like the price per contract and the price per share are increasing beyond that. So can you talk a little bit about what's going behind the scenes, particularly in equities, where pricing and share are both increasing, which doesn't happen very often; and then on the Liffe side, where the rate RPC and financial RPC also seems to be on the rise?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Ken, this is Jeff. Yes, well, I've been pretty outspoken that I don't really believe that -- in payment for order flow schemes. I think they're value-destructive for shareholders. But beyond that, as a regulated exchange, if you want to pay people to show up in the market, in other words, expand the market by attracting traders that really don't want to hold the risk of your products but just want to pay to -- get paid to be there, it creates an incentive, unfortunately, for people that do wash trades, in other words, to buy and sell without ever actually trying -- holding any risk. And that's a disservice to the market, and it's self-regulated organizations. That's a policy that we need to prohibit. And so to actually be creating incentives to do that at the same time that you're trying to prohibit it seems counterintuitive and counterproductive. So what we have done in the new businesses that we have acquired is brought our philosophy on how to operate markets to those, and we're making subtle changes in the way we compensate market makers who do provide a valuable service to the market and getting rid of pricing schemes that we don't like, that we don't think are helpful. Obviously, at the New York Stock Exchange, we've been quite public about it, because of its stature, in how we've been eliminating order types and simplifying the business. And I think, at the end of the day, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the people that actually want to hold risk are attracted to those kinds of markets. They want to participate in markets where they're fair and they're transparent and they can get business done and that they're not subject to a lot of predatory practices that are really there because of economic incentives. And it's why, frankly, you hear us not talk a lot about market share or trying to use ICE's absolute volumes as a predictor of our earnings per share. We're a growth company, and when we talk about growth, we mean earnings per share growth and shareholder value creation and not just growing top line volumes, which we could easily do by having payment for order flow schemes. But it's just really not in our DNA. We have other actors in the market that do, do those things. It allows us to differentiate ourselves. And when we differentiate ourselves, it gives us a selling opportunity to customers, and that's what I mentioned is happening, we believe, in the Brent market. And it's really -- it creates a virtuous circle for us because these kinds of commercial users of markets really are quite sticky and appreciate the kind of service that we provide.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And as the follow-up, has your philosophy fully permeated the pricing at Liffe? Or is there more to go there? And then same question separately on the New York Stock Exchange. Is there more to go there as well?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","I think it's fair to say there's more to go in the sense that all the new businesses that we acquire have legacy contracts in place and legacy pricing systems and other things that, either through regulatory action or through letting contracts run off, take time to change. But we have our teams focused on exactly these issues, on simplifying markets, making them better, more transparent, and I think that work will continue well into 2015.","Operator","The next question is from Christian Onwugbolu from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Chinedu Christian Onwugbolu - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Jeff, a bigger-picture question on strategy. You are building a franchise, an impressive array of services across clearing, post-trade services and data. And you've spoken about your desire to offer value beyond trade margin. But given trade margins still account for the vast majority of your revenues, I'm curious to how -- your overall plan on how you monetize these services. Should they drive more volumes? Is it better pricing or something else we're not thinking about?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, it's a good question. First of all, I think, actually, if you look at our pricing schedule, the bulk of our earnings probably today come substantially due to clearing and post-trade services, which is a big shift for the company just given that in 2007 was the first time we even had any kind of clearing infrastructure, and we really started expanding it during the financial crisis and shortly thereafter. But what we're hearing from our customers, particularly due to the regulatory uncertainty which exists in almost every jurisdiction around the world, is that people need solutions. And the rules are still being written, so that it's not fully clear to everybody what solutions are needed and where they are needed. And so it's just been our goal really since the financial crisis to be -- have assets geographically located and up and down the value chain so that we can provide those services. And we've been surprised. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, it's surprising to see the European business leaving Europe and coming to the U.S. That isn't something we really could have predicted even 2 years ago. We have a strong sentiment that business is going to continue to move to Asia, and we're making investments there. We see our competitors following us oftentimes in those areas, so I think there's obviously a trend going on there.","So long story short, during these times of uncertainty, it's been good for us to have a lot of assets, and we'll see how they play out. Honestly, we just want to provide solutions and charge appropriately for them, and our customers will largely dictate where that value will be created and what part of the value chain that they're willing to give to us.","Chinedu Christian Onwugbolu - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. On LIBOR administration, you've had a few months now to assess the customer base and the likely impact of charging for that product. It would be helpful if you could share with us maybe lessons learned, any statistics at all on likely demand for the product.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Sure. Well, the first thing is we are amazed by the breadth of the use of LIBOR around the world. Just the sheer number of people that will need a license from us is somewhat overwhelming. And so we've been having a lot of conversations with industry trade groups and other ways of talking to a lot of customers at one time and one -- through one voice and one venue about how we go about actually signing people up and, ultimately, charging for the -- for an appropriate value.","Everyone wants LIBOR to be improved. Everyone wants LIBOR to be more predictable and based on auditable transactions. And so there's a strong interest in having us continue to invest in that product, and then the real question is how does the market pay for that and reward us for taking a risk.","We spent a number of quarters having those conversations. We've not really settled on a plan that -- as Scott mentioned, we'll start seeing economics roll through us in 2015. We do want to make it easy for people to sign up. I think, as we continue to integrate SuperDerivatives into the company, we'll have a platform by which it will be easier for our customers to access the LIBOR, if they don't have an easy way to access it already. And so that's, directionally, the plan we're going. I think you're going to see it play out in 2015 and beyond as the market gets used to the fact that this is a benchmark that has value, that is transparent, that they do rely on and they're willing to market -- willing to license as we market it to them.","Operator","The next question is from Chris Allen with Evercore.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore ISI, Research Division","You'd mentioned earlier that bonus accrual expected to go back up next year. And I'm just wondering about how you guys are thinking about the growth opportunities from a top line perspective looking into next year because, I mean, the feedback right now from the buyside is pretty challenging outlook given where the ECB rate environment is, oil prices sub-80 and U.S. natural gas volatility remaining subdued. So I'm just wondering, where are you most optimistic about growth for -- into next year?","Scott A. Hill","I think it goes back to what Jeff said, Chris. I'm most optimistic about our ability to grow earnings. And we are in a difficult volume environment. But I step back and look at all the other levers that we've got in order to generate growth.","We've got a very strong market data business. We've got a business in listings that had a very good 2014. And as you know, that largely flows through into revenues in 2015. We've got -- I just basically gave you a 2015 guidance that we're going to take out over $100 million of expenses next year. We've repurchased 2% of our outstanding shares since we closed the deal. So as I look towards 2015, even in a difficult volume environment, I'm very confident we'll grow our earnings double digits next year.","So I feel -- look, and then again, I look at an October that had huge Brent volume growth. Again, OI has been trending up. Here comes volatility. There goes volumes. The U.K. sentiment is improving, as I mentioned. There goes Sterling and Gilt volumes in October. I look at equity indices that I think I mentioned were up 50% year-over-year in October. Continued strength in the MSCI contract, continued strength in the FTSE. So I think, when the buyside you're referring to talks about challenges, they're thinking about Euribor and nat gas. And we're more than Euribor and nat gas, and I think that's what gets missed.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore ISI, Research Division","Got it. And then just a quick follow-up. Just on the increase in synergy realization and just in terms of the pace and then first quarter being north of $380 million, just kind of curious what's driving that?","Scott A. Hill","Yes, Chris, I think there are a couple things. I think, number one, it's -- we've had to merge the finance and forecasting systems and all that over the course of the year, and we're just getting better at getting the information up into a consumable fashion.","But I think the other thing that we're really focused in on, and we've talked about this a lot, we, historically, at ICE have had about 5% of our population in consultants, give or take a little bit. NYSE was closer to 20%. And we've mentioned on at least 2 or 3 occasions that, that's an area where we've been focused and where we're starting to see some yield from those efforts. I think, as you look into fourth quarter, you're going to see professional services expense start to trend down a little bit related to the exits of some of those consulting resources.","So it's really -- it's just executing our plans, getting our arms around a little better the data that's coming up through our consolidated systems. And then it's really been a laser focus on trying to get back to the resource model that we've driven historically at ICE.","Operator","The next question is from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I don't think this has been asked yet, but can you talk about the buybacks a little more? I mean, it seems like that post Euronext IPO, you did a big chunk, and then it's been fairly consistent, maybe $50 million, $60 million per quarter, and it sounds like October is $64 million again. So $150 million to $200 million per quarter, is that a good run rate to use until we extinguish that $500 million that you have left?","Scott A. Hill","Yes, Alex, look, first of all, I think you have to remember that we were effectively precluded from doing buybacks until we got delevered. And so the big burst that you saw after Euronext was us taking Euronext proceeds, getting delevered and, I would suggest to you, catching up a little bit from the fact that we hadn't been in the market earlier in the year.","I wouldn't change the way we characterize our thinking about share repurchases now. We've got strong cash flows. We pay our dividend. We're able to make acquisitions. And then we look at what's the capital that we have left, what's available to us and what is the highest-value investment that we can make. And right now, looking at our share price and where it's been and where it's trending, that still looks like a pretty good deal, and I think that's reflected in what you're seeing as kind of a steady participation by us in the market.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. And then secondly, maybe just on synergies again but not on the cost side. I mean, I think somebody asked earlier around some of the pricing changes you've made or appear to have made on Liffe and NYSE. Can you expand a little bit beyond the transaction side? If you look at the NYSE today, how much time are you spending on looking what they've been charging for things like market data, for listings, for transactions, obviously, and some of the other things that they've done? And maybe talk a little bit more where there have been changes and where there's been maybe revenue synergies that you realized, if you have a dollar number, that'd be great; and maybe where there could be other opportunities as we look into 2015.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, Alex, as you know -- I think you know we now have Tom Farley, who's been a longtime colleague of everyone in this room, who's now fully ensconced in the exchange, and really his eyes and ears to be the envoy of -- to take the kind of operational mentality that we've had at ICE that has worked successfully for us and to put it into the exchange.","So I think the NYSE is a great business and a great franchise and a great brand and has a lot of respect in the marketplace. And I think that it can be differentiated from others that want to provide services on more of a commodity basis. And what we have seen is there certainly are areas where people want to pay more to be affiliated with us and to also take advantage of the systems that we've put in place. I mean, it shouldn't be lost on anyone that, for example, the Alibaba IPO, which was one of the -- it was not only the largest IPO in history, but it was one of the most complicated transactions in terms of the number of firms on Wall Street that were involved, the distribution of their systems around the world, the pressure on the entire capital-raising platform around U.S. listings to manage that kind of demand in a single moment in time where we pushed millions of shares serially through these systems without a glitch. And so that was owed a lot of testing, a lot of communication, a really improving relationship I think we have with The Street and the market distribution system, all of which people are willing to pay for. So it's in that scheme that we're thinking about the New York Stock Exchange and what else we can continue to do there.","You laid out on the fact that, I think, matching a buyer and seller of a U.S. equity is about the most simple market in the world. I mean, it's amazing how overly complicated the world has made what really should be, in my mind, the most simple market in the world. And we've gotten to a point where the average transaction size, regardless of who's buying, is 200 shares of stock. It really has gotten to a point where you can no longer tell the difference between a large institutional investor, an ETF buyer, you and I as retail investors or anyone else. And so it's become incredibly homogeneous and egalitarian, in a sense. And so it just sort of demands simplicity, and it seems like the simpler we try to make it, the more we're being rewarded. And so we're going to continue on that trend.","Operator","The next question is from Niamh Alexander of KBW.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","If I could just look at the cash and the CapEx, the real estate, I think it's pretty much in line with what you expected, but it still seems elevated for what you need to do. Just help me think about, is this a good run rate for next year, the year after? Is this how we should think about the level of CapEx and real estate spend that this business needs? Or is it kind of just post deal, and it should come in?","Scott A. Hill","Yes, Niamh, thanks for the question. So I do think that you can look at 2014 as kind of a marker for where we would expect to be in 2015. The major investments that are embedded in that are the ones that we've talked about before. It's CapEx. It's real estate, as you noted, largely around us consolidating our real estate footprint in our major cities, particularly in New York, here in Atlanta, in London, et cetera. Obviously, with the addition of SuperD, we'll have some additional real estate and some additional consolidation work that we'll need to do.","So I do think that what you're seeing in 2014 in terms of total levels of CapEx will be pretty consistent as you move into 2015. A big part of that investment, frankly, is enabling the synergies that we're achieving in the cost line. And so I mentioned earlier, 2015, I think, is going to be another good year in terms of synergy realization. And I think, as you get out into '16 and '17, you'll start to see those CapEx levels come down.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then on the, I guess, on the cash too, with respect to kind of the changing how you want to present your earnings a little bit. It's like, certainly, the cash earnings have exceeded the GAAP earnings at ICE for some time, and even more so since the deal because of the elevated D&A. So help me think about just, like, why now are you going to strip out the intangible amortization of the deals? Why is it -- is it not just a gimmick to kind of help your stock? Or why now? And what's the rationale?","Scott A. Hill","Yes, so I think, Niamh, the rationale -- it's not a gimmick. I mean, the rationale is simply what you said, which is we believe that excluding the amortization of intangibles will give investors a much better view into the cash generative power of our earnings. Frankly, it's something that you see a lot of technology-oriented and particularly acquisitive technology-oriented companies doing in order to highlight, again, the cash generative trends embedded in their EPS. So this is really an effort on our part to continue to provide increasing amounts of transparency to shareholders.","Importantly, though, we're not walking away from the investments that we've made. We're going to continue to focus on our returns on invested capital. That is a meaningful metric. Even as we -- we're kind of working our way through having that full investment embedded in that metric, and the profitability's still impacted by some of the integration costs, our ROIC remains above those of our nearest competitors. And again, we're at the bottom now, and the trend is only up from here. So I think the move to the adjusted EPS excluding the deal-related intangibles is common to acquisitive companies. It's more transparent for our shareholders, and we'll continue to focus on our returns.","And Niamh, I know you follow the space well. Another company that just, for example, in our industry, does it is the London Stock Exchange. And again, I think it's -- Xavier does it for a similar set of reasons.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two questions just on the recent acquisition. So first, Jeff, on the Holland Clearing House, if I think about the number of clearing houses that you guys have now globally, you're fairly well positioned. But when you think about over the next, I don't know if it's 2, 3, 5 years, when a lot of the regulations are finalized, do you think you're going to need that network, or will you get more consolidation, meaning clients are going to want to put more of their positions into a few clearing houses versus kind of sporadic around the world?","And then just on the SuperDerivatives. So when I think about the opportunity there, is there an opportunity, obviously, for you guys to use some of that -- the risk management analytics internally? But on the client side, is there any way to like size what clients would be using this service, what they use currently? Any way to like try to size that opportunity over the next few years as you map that out?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Those are both good questions. First of all, on clearing, we don't really know where the market's going to go. I mean, one thing you can see is that the well-capitalized exchange operators are increasingly building clearing infrastructure and opening new clearing houses around the world. I think the clearing business is going to take well-capitalized operators because these are very complex businesses, and the barrier to entry is rising as a result of the capital needs of these clearing houses.","We don't know what the Basel rules yet are going to do to many of our customers in terms of their ability to lend collateral and hold collateral and rehypothecate collateral on behalf of customers, whether or not it's going to make sense geographically to separate that or whether it will -- whether market forces will try to consolidate clearing in a small number of venues. We literally just don't know.","And the nice thing about the Holland Clearing House is that it is an established clearing house with a customer that is providing revenues to cover the operation of that clearing house. It gives us a footprint in Continental Europe.","There's a lawsuit, as you may know, that's going on between the U.K. and the EU over whether or not euro-denominated products should be cleared in the Eurozone. We don't know the outcome of that. I don't -- as a manager, I'm not willing to speculate on it. I just want to make sure that our customers can seamlessly operate with us should the lawsuit go one way versus another. So it gave us a really good reason to keep diversity.","We put all of those clearing houses on a single platform. We have a small group of highly talented quantitative people that, increasingly, our customers are coming to know. We have a small group of really highly talented regulatory people that are providing a lot of advice to our customers. And so we're in a position to move positions around the world on behalf of our customers very, very seamlessly. And you've seen us do it many times before. We understand how it's done. Our customers have confidence in our ability to do it. So we just want to maintain that flexibility for them.","I wish I knew the answer to it because we'd bias our behavior one place versus another. But right now, what are customers are telling us is regulatory reform has not yet rolled out. The Basel rules have not yet rolled out. And until we all have a pretty good view of what it ultimately looks like, people want to have a lot of flexibility.","With respect to SuperDerivatives, one of the interesting things that has happened to this company is that, with the result of moving into various asset classes now, we have a very, very large and diverse data business. It's all been embedded at the various exchanges, largely. But increasingly now, with ICE Benchmark Administration, creating benchmarks with our swaps data repositories, holding positions, and with all of the clearing and execution venues that we have, both futures and OTC around the world across various asset classes, we have quite a data package. And SuperDerivatives gives us an opportunity to think about how we can best provide that directly to our customers for those that may want to take it that way. And in addition, we are producing a lot of risk management data and tools inside the company that we use in clearing. And increasingly, our customers want access to those so that they can do pro forma calculations and risk management ahead of trading. Particularly, I think, that's going to increase as customers are faced with limited collateral and multiple choices from global exchange operators on where and how to do business.","And so it's hard to size that opportunity. I think it's a business that came along at exactly the right time for us because our customers are telling us that these are the kinds of things that they need access to. And I think the people at SuperDerivatives are better prepared to build a lot of that than ICE is itself. And so we're already integrating that company quickly, and we're turning over a lot of responsibilities to them. And I think we'll see how it pays dividends on the top line, but I know it's going to increase customer satisfaction a lot.","Operator","Your next question is from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So just a quick follow-up on SuperDerivatives, but I guess a bigger-picture question on the interest rate swap clearing opportunity for you guys in Europe. That marketplace, obviously, seems to be a little bit more crowded than what it is in the U.S. And I'm just curious how you guys think about what ICE's differentiating strength should be in that market that will set you apart from other players that are planning to compete in that space?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, it's a good question. I do think that what, as I mentioned before, what the market is sort of shaping up is the well-capitalized exchange operators are really investing in clearing technology and innovation around clearing technology. And I think you're going to see the sort of the usual suspects have very, very broad offerings across multiple asset classes and multiple jurisdictions. And it's ultimately then going to be the ability to market to customers, the ability to provide the right tools to give people the most capital-efficient way of doing business. I think that ICE led the way, for example, in investing in our risk waterfall. That was not a common process earlier in the history of clearing. So we've got skin in the game that influences the capital needs of our customers, lowers them, for example, but also similarly increases the demand, if you will, internally for our own people to manage that business as if it was their own money, because it is, and do a better job. And I think little innovative techniques along the way will differentiate the clearing houses. But I do think we've pretty much seen who the main players are going to be and where they're likely going to be located.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And Scott, a quick follow-up for you. And sorry, another one around expenses. But I guess, when you take a step back, and I appreciate all the color you guys have given out, and there's a number of moving pieces, but you've demonstrated a number of times at this point that you're able to flex your expense muscle, not just when it comes to the integration of the business but also when it comes to kind of legacy core ICE franchise. So as we think about beyond the synergies that are sort of still left, can you talk a little bit about where you think the normal like kind of core growth rate in the expense base is, assuming not a whole lot of change in the revenue environment?","Scott A. Hill","Yes. It's a good question. And I think it's somewhat reflected in kind of what we've referred to, the investments as we entered into 2014, and I gave you kind of a brief preview of 2015. It's kind of in that 2% to 3% range. We had mentioned, coming into this year, $350 million [ph]. And that's on an expense base that, give or take a little bit, $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion, similarly, based on our guidance now, will be around $1.5 billion. I mentioned $30 million-ish of investments next year, which is about 2%.","So -- and I think if you go back and look historically, that tends to be what you've seen from us. It's not a big expense growth. It largely is around us either hiring technology resources or continuing to pay competitively for our resources, but you don't see a lot of growth in professional services or SG&A or rent or any of those other lines. In fact, as we've consolidated real estate, rent has come down. As we've eliminated consultants, professional services have gone down. And so I'd say, overall, kind of 2% to 3% is a decent expectation bottom line. That's probably a little more on the compensation line, with some efficiencies generated out of the other line.","Operator","And the next question is from Dan Fannon of Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I guess, just in terms of your customer mix if you're thinking about the energy segment, can you talk about, October, there was a spike in volatility? Can you talk about certain customers that are acting more -- being more active in that environment or who you're -- where you're seeing, even x that going back into the summer, where the most fall-off in terms of trading was in terms of your customers, and how kind of your commercial segment has held up during that time as well?","Scott A. Hill","Yes, I think, historically, we've tended to underperform when you see spikes of volatility because we don't have the hedge funds. We don't tend to have more of the guys who are taking a speculative view on which way energy prices will go -- are going. But when you see a more sustained volatility, which we did see through October, it's a spike relative to what we'd seen in the year, but we were fairly confident in the month. What you see is OI positions that have grown, which is indicative of the commercial customers who are trading in our markets. They start to manage their positions around that volatility, trying to figure out what is this signal for where prices are going to be 3 months from now, 6 months from now, 9 months from now. And so I think it really gets down to the commercial customers that are in our base and the growth in open interest. And then once the volatility returns, it's those commercial customers that are managing their positions that tend to lead to the volume growth that we see. And that's why, with those spikes, you don't see big changes in our RPC. It tends to be pretty stable because it's not the price-sensitive guys that are piling in with volume. It's commercial customers that are managing their risk positions.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And I guess just one more on the synergies. Can you talk about what milestones are left in terms of kind of the big buckets as you kind of head -- exit this year and into next year?","Scott A. Hill","Yes. So obviously, the big one, as we exit this year, and Jeff mentioned, we're 4 out of the 5 transition cycles through the Liffe integration. We've got to get the fifth one done. That's the big one as we enter the year. As you look over the course of 2015, it's really some clean-up around some of the corporate functions and systems that we're integrating, Project Abby being an important one that will help us rationalize the technology footprint at the New York Stock Exchange. Clearly, real estate consolidation as we move later into '15 and into 2016. Prior to the NYSE deal, I think we peaked at 11 different leases in New York. We had finally gotten down to one prior to the deal. We've now got a handful of leases in New York again. We'll look to consolidate those. And again, that's why they're '15, '16.","And then the other thing we announced, I think it was earlier in October, was that we're going to be bringing the regulation of the markets at NYSE back in-house. And so that's a synergy we'll be working on over the course of 2015. Frankly, embedded in the investments is the investment to build that functionality at NYSE. And then as you get out to 2016, we'll take that function on.","So those are some of the bigger things. As you might expect, as we get deeper into '15, the items start to shrink in size, and it's a handful of smaller items as opposed to 1 or 2 large items.","Operator","And the next question is from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A really good year for you guys for CDS clearing. Scott, I think this is kind of tracking right in line with where you said it would be. How should we be thinking about the long-term growth rate for this part of your business? And then related to that, are there any catalysts to look forward to that could potentially get trading revenues growing again?","Scott A. Hill","Yes, it's a great question. So as I step back and look at what's really driving the growth this year, the notional that's been cleared this year has been about 70% from the buyside. And if you think about it, 2 years ago, buyside wasn't even in clearing. Well, last year, I think it was 26% of our notional. This year, it's 70% of the notional. And that's what's really driving the revenue performance.","I mentioned in my prepared remarks that European clients now make up 40% of the volume that we're clearing. Those European clients don't have a mandate to clear. And they're showing up in our clearing house because, number one, there is uncertainty in Europe with regards to what is the impact of Mifid II, what is the impact of EMIR. And I think customers are starting -- European customers are starting to look for what's become a relatively more certain environment in the U.S. I also think that they're attracted to the fact that we offer clearing not just of the indexed products, which is interesting but not particularly relevant if you don't also offer the single names. If you're long the names and short the index or vice versa, you don't want to be margined on both parts of that. You want to come to a clearing house that can offer you portfolio margining. We can do that.","A lot of the trading activity that is happening today where we are seeing growth in CDS is single names, and it is sovereign. We offer all the major single names. We offer all the major sovereign CDS products. Remember that we still have to launch, but the ones where the trading is the largest, we offer those products for clearing.","So I think all of those have been catalysts for the CDS growth, frankly. We earned -- or I said $23 million in the third quarter. We earned $12 million of revenue in the month of October. So as the CDS [indiscernible] were changed and we saw the lull moving to October, we had a fantastic October to continue that trend.","As far as where the market goes, I think the big unknown is the last thing you asked in your question, and that's what happens with the trading environment. And I really -- my view is I think there are going to be 2 differences. I think, from an Endex standpoint, the question is does the indexed product stay in the over-the-counter market, as it is today, or does it move into something that's more like a futures. And we're working with the market to figure out what that product design might look like. Frankly, I think the single name is unlikely to change. I think that, as people are finding it harder and harder to get exposure to company's credit through the bonds, that we're seeing a pickup in that CDS activity. I think that's a good trend as we look forward.","So I think there are a number of drivers. Even though the buyside has started to move in this year in size, I still think there's a lot of buyside clearing to go. So I think there are a number of growth drivers. Being able to tell you that I think a business is going to do just under 100, can grow 10%, 15%, 20%, 25% a year, I think it's hard to say without knowing the trading environment. But I certainly think the trend is up. I certainly think it's still a growth business for us. And again, an important thing not to get lost is it's not just revenue. It drops meaningful profit to our bottom line. So it's a good business for us. We expect it to continue to grow. And I think the big trends behind it are the buyside and the global nature of the clearing house here in the U.S.","Operator","The next question is from Jillian Miller, BMO Capital Markets.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So just following up on that last question. You mentioned that a lot of the European buyside are already kind of accessing your CDS clearing offering despite the fact we don't have mandates yet. And I'm just trying to get a sense for whether we should be expecting some kind of step function when the mandates do come in, in early 2016 for the buyside or whether you think those folks are already clearing in advance or will, I guess, more gradually be moving into it throughout the course of 2015?","Scott A. Hill","Yes, I think it's somewhere in the middle. I certainly don't expect some math that's step function because, again, we are seeing -- and it's not unusual, right? I mean, typically, it doesn't take a law to move people to clearing. It takes a realization that clearing really does reduce risk. So I think we are seeing the buyside move in.","I certainly think the mandates will help. We saw that here in the U.S. We got some early participation from the buyside. But once the U.S. mandates kicked in, we certainly did see an uptick in the revenue. So I think that the subsequent mandates in Europe, which I'm now hearing could be pushed out all the way into early 2016, will halt, but I don't think it's a step function. I think the growth in that business, again, is going to come from an improvement of the trading environment, us continuing to launch more products and more people, more buyside customers in particular, seeking out efficient portfolio margining that we can deliver in our clearing house.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then just wanted to check in and get a progress update on the Brazil initiatives, BRIX and Cetip. I think back, I mean, several years ago now, when you first moved into the area, but I think you said that those projects would potentially become more meaningful to the bottom line some time around 2015 or '16. And just wanted to see if that's still kind of generally the expectation and, I guess, just where we are with those projects.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Yes, look, I think I would characterize the Brazil relationship as continuing on a positive note, probably a little slower than what we would have anticipated. But I think, importantly, we've got a bond platform that we've launched with Cetip that has started to pick up some meaningful share. It's certainly being noticed by market participants, and that's one initiative that we've been very successful with. As you know, there's not a lot of clearing choice in Brazil. We have a strong clearing franchise of -- you might imagine there are other projects that we're working on with them.","So I did say 2 or 3 years ago that I thought, as we got into '15, that we would start to see a little bit of yield. I think that's probably still a couple of years away in terms of seeing a meaningful yield within our P&L. That notwithstanding, we do think it is a very strategic environment for us. And I think Brazil is an important country. It's very commodity-rich. And so I think it's an important relationship where we'll continue to invest.","I think the other thing not to get lost is we do participate as shareholders in the dividend, and you we saw, I think it was in the second quarter, where we got a meaningful dividend from that relationship as well.","But on the more strategic front, I would characterize it as a little slower than we had anticipated but still a very positive relationship, a strong relationship and one that we do think will bear fruit as we look out into the future.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Jeff, maybe you can expand a little bit on 2 of the acquisitions that you have on -- that you highlighted in terms of SuperDerivatives and maybe the Singapore effort as well. I appreciate, on the SuperDerivatives, it's still difficult to size that opportunity, but maybe if we can think of how you think you can scale that business from a revenue expense perspective. And maybe that's a question for Scott. But then also, on the Singapore side, what you see as the long-term growth outlook for that effort.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, sure. It's very hard to put numbers on it, and I know that's what, ultimately, you need. And as an entrepreneur, what I see in the company is that we have a lot of content, and we have an amazing sales force and customer relationship footprint. And they had great technology and really good quantitative people. And so it looks to us like 1 and 1 makes 3 in this regard. I really do think that ICE will have a lot of content and the distribution capabilities that we can bring to their systems, and we're embedding their quants right away into our risk management infrastructure, and they're helping us with a lot of complicated multi-asset class derivatizes that I think will pay dividends down the road in clearing and settlement capabilities. So it's all -- much of it is forward-looking, but it's a very, very nice fit for us. And it was an entrepreneurial company. It is an entrepreneurial company. It fits well within our culture. I think it's a company that we'll be able to quickly deliver some results on.","With respect to Singapore, we -- we've spent the last few quarters basically embedding the ICE clearing and trading technology into that Singapore Exchange. We've put a whole new team around it, hired risk managers and are working with the customers there and the regulator there to now move forward with this launch that we anticipate will happen in March of '15.","We just see a lot of demand in Asia. And ICE has grew -- if you look at us, we grew all through the financial crisis, and largely it was because the emerging economies were adopting risk management, and many of them were prepared to come and meet us in Europe to do business. With the uncertainties about European regulation, it's just it's not clear whether or not, to us, Asian customers want to come there, whether they would prefer to meet us in the U.S. or whether they want to meet in Singapore. And so I know that all of this new infrastructure for regulation and reporting and oversight is very, very complicated. And the further away you get from your own domicile, the harder it is to fully comprehend this stuff. And so it's why we really think there's a regional opportunity out there.","What business moves that way? It's hard to say, but we want to -- if we're all going to be on the same platform and in the same systems and the same people involved, then I think we can provide that opportunity somewhat seamlessly to the market, and we'll just see where the market takes us.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then my follow-up would be back to Brent, obviously seeing very good momentum. I don't know if you can size what you think is the revenue contribution right now from the arbitrage that's going on with your exchanging it from the competitive payments over to flow. And then, Jeff, if you want to talk about the longer-term adoption of Brent as a benchmark. Do you still think there is pretty good legs on that trend? We've already seen pretty good progress on that.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Yes. It's hard to know what that arbitrage is. We know -- we just look at the markets and people that are in the markets, and we can see behavior that looks like somebody that's trying to get paid by moving trades back and forth on a competitive exchange and then ultimately looking at us as the primary market to figure out where the real price is and laying off, from time to time, that risk back into the primary market, for which we charge full price and benefit. And it really is a transfer of wealth from one company to another. So we try to set it up that way. We try to charge people that way so that we get some net benefit out of what our competitors do. It's not something we can predict. We never know what our competitors are going to do, what schemes they may have. But importantly, we have a pretty close eye on it, and we do monitor trading activity in our markets and adjust our pricing and response accordingly to try to grow revenues, which is really what we're all about here, not necessarily market share.","Scott A. Hill","Well, just -- but to kind of put an edge on that point, market share has been pretty stable at about 55% of the total oil anyway. So you talk about the trading schemes and the buy-1-get-3-free-type programs, the reality is the Brent market keeps getting bigger. I think Brent OI now -- our Brent OI is now larger than the OI of the CME's WTI. And so as I look at total share, as I look at the nature of the volumes that we're getting the revenue that it generates, we feel pretty good about where we are in our oil franchise.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just on the longer-term benchmark adoption of Brent that, I think, Jeff, you alluded to earlier?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Yes. Well, one of the things that's going on right now is a consultation in Europe about oil pricing in general and the regulation of benchmarks more broadly. There's going to be some -- there's the consultation going. There's an opportunity for the market to talk to the regulators about the commodities markets, and specifically the oil markets, on the need or lack of need for additional regulation.","We're in the business of producing benchmarks now, and we've got the infrastructure to do it and the governance around it and a good relationship with the regulators. We're going to let that process play out. Our customers are going to have a strong say in it. As you regulate benchmarks, you're really pulling in the physical markets, the underlying markets and the transaction in those markets which make up the benchmark. So you're moving regulation further down the chain, and that impacts our customers, so we'll see what their response is. But broadly speaking, we're set up really for however the regulators come out and want us to operate that benchmark.","The Brent index is a benchmark that we do set and have set for many, many years internally. And those processes may become more transparent, I suspect, as the nature of benchmark price setting is trending that way generally.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeffrey Sprecher, Chairman and CEO, for any closing remarks.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, thank you, Kate, and thank you all for joining us this morning. And we'll look forward to continuing to speak with you throughout the quarter. Have a good day.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

ICE Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Ms. Kelly Loeffler. You may begin, ma'am.","Kelly L. Loeffler","Good morning. ICE's third quarter 2012 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of our website at theice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay.","Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties.","Please note that the numbers presented today refer to our adjusted operating results, which we believe are more reflective of the performance of our business. You'll find the non-GAAP reconciliation in the earnings release and presentation, as well as an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful and how management uses these measures.","For a discussion on the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the company's Form 10-K and quarterly reports including our third quarter Form 10-Q, which was filed with the SEC this morning.","With us today are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Chuck Vice, President and COO.","I'll now turn the call over to Scott.","Scott A. Hill","Thanks, Kelly. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us on the call today. Our third quarter results continue to distinguish ICE from our peers, and our revenue, profit and cash growth through the first 9 months of this year, despite the challenging environment, delivered meaningful value to our shareholders.","During the quarter, we successfully transitioned our 800 cleared OTC energy contracts to our futures market while maintaining capital efficiency and without market disruption. And we continued to develop many new strategic opportunities across geographies and asset classes. Our financial performance, our operational execution and our strategic investment provide us with momentum as we work to close out a solid 2012, and as we establish plans for growth and strong return, again, in 2013.","Please turn to Slide 4 where I'll start with an overview of our performance in the first 9 months of this year.","Revenues grew 4% year-to-year to a record $1 billion. Net income attributable to ICE was $422 million, up 10% year-to-year. And operating margin increased to 61%. Diluted earnings per share rose 11% and operating cash flow grew 6%. This strong performance has enabled us to continue to prudently invest in several initiatives ranging from our APX-ENDEX agreement to the acquisition of WhenTech.","Moving to Slide 5, I'll detail our third quarter results. Consolidated revenues were $323 million, a decline of 5% year-to-year. Consolidated operating expenses declined by 6%. Operating income of $194 million produced an operating margin of 60%. Continued growth in our non-U.S. businesses and further reductions in the U.K. corporate tax rate currently have us on track towards a 29% tax rate for the year. We true up to our full year expectation each quarter which resulted in a third quarter tax rate of 27%. Diluted earnings per share were down 1% from the prior year to $1.79.","Turning to Slide 6. I will detail the revenue and expense components of our third quarter results. This year's third quarter was characterized by significant regulatory uncertainty, a stagnant U.S. economy and concerns relating to European economic and monetary policy. You can see on the left side of the page that despite these challenges, futures revenues increased 1% to $156 million. This was driven by energy futures revenue, which increased 3% from the same period last year. On the OTC energy side, revenues declined 10% to $90 million due to less volatile North American natural gas and power market.","We believe that the continued uncertainty around regulation for swaps has also impacted our OTC results over the last several months. However, in the short time since we transitioned to futures we have seen a good improvement in the market liquidity in those products.","OTC credit markets were impacted by regulatory uncertainty to an even greater extent, leading to revenues declining to $33 million. In total, our consolidated transaction and clearing revenues were down by 7% to $279 million. Market data revenue, however, grew 12% year-to-year to $36 million, demonstrating the continued demand for our globally relevant commodity market and related market data.","Moving to the right side of Slide 6. Operating expenses were $129 million, down 6% from the prior third quarter and down 5% from second quarter 2012 levels. Year-to-date, operating expenses rose modestly, and we now expect full year expense to grow by no more than 2%.","In response to the current economic environment and regulatory uncertainty, we continue to efficiently manage our resources even as we invest for future growth.","I want to pause here and talk specifically about third quarter compensation expenses, which include a year-to-date true-up reflecting a reduction in our bonus -- performance bonus accrual, together with an offsetting impact from severance expenses recorded in the third quarter. As you know, we have a strong pay-for-performance culture that provides alignment with our shareholders. Though we continue to significantly outperform our global peer group, we benchmark our financial performance objectives to a higher standard.","As noted, the reduction in our bonus accrual was largely offset by severance-related expenses following staff reductions, primarily, in our credit business. We continue to take steps to reduce expenses and improve operating efficiencies while investing in the technology that has made us the leader in the CDS execution, clearing and post-trade services.","With a lean infrastructure and strong expense discipline, ICE generates leading margins and returns regardless of market conditions.","Let's turn to Slide 7 to review the third quarter performance in our futures segment. Futures revenue increased 1% over the prior year despite a 4% decline in average daily volume. In ICE Futures Europe, growth on top of growth continues to be a theme. Brent, emissions and energy options posted strong volume increases. Brent average daily volume grew 20% in the quarter. Market participants have continued to shift to the North Sea market to ensure proper hedging of global oil prices.","Notably, Brent futures and options open interest is up over 100% from the end of 2011.","For the quarter, emissions' average daily volume increased 13% as demand for carbon reduction contracts strengthened as we near Phase 3 deadlines. Currency conversion negatively impacted revenue growth for emissions during the third quarter, but underlying demand is solid and new participants continue to enter the market. We believe the opportunity in this space will contribute to our growth as participation in this new asset class continues to expand.","Gasoil futures saw a slight pullback in volumes during the quarter related to the forward curve and to a lesser extent the transition phase between product specifications.","Building interest in our Low Sulphur Gasoil Contract as the premier diesel benchmark continues with dozens of firms now active in the new contract.","Smaller, but also promising contracts, such as U.S. Heating Oil and RBOB Gasoline posted volume growth of 90% and 105% respectively versus last year's third quarter. These are reflective of ICE's growing role in serving the global middle distillate market, as well as the benefits that margin offsets provide within what has become the broadest energy market globally.","Open interest across our energy complex continues to reach new highs, rising 74% from the end of 2011.","Moving to Ag products, volume grew in sugar, coffee and cocoa, and our new corn, wheat and soybean futures continue to attract interest. Open interest at ICE Futures U.S. has increased 5% from the start of the year with an improved environment post-MF Global and the return of commodity financing to the market.","Finally, this morning we reported October futures volumes which were up 2% from October 2011, with energy up 5% and Ag volume up 12%. While a number of events have pressured volume, we anticipate that the current environment is more cyclical than secular, and expect a return to more active hedging and trading in the new year as uncertainty around regulatory and political outcomes is resolved.","On Slide 8, I'll review our OTC business for the third quarter.","Prior to our swaps to futures transition in October, we believe many OTC participants paused as rule makings were drafted and as market participants began to assess the requirements of transacting in OTC markets.","In the third quarter, OTC energy average daily commissions declined 9% from the prior third quarter to $1.4 million. North American natural gas and power revenue declined on lower volatility and lower absolute price levels. Regulatory uncertainty and muted economic activity levels have impacted energy production and consumption. However, consistent with increased demands for hedging and clearing in Europe and Asia, global oil revenues rose 17% to $14 million.","This morning, we reported average daily commission in our historically OTC markets for October along with our futures volumes to provide transparency into both metrics for the month.","Average daily commissions in October were $1.5 million, up from September, which was also up from August. Prior to the storm last week, the number was tracking closer to $1.6 million. So we have seen healthy improvement off of sluggish summer levels and continue to see strong open interest trends post transition.","Turning to our credit derivatives business. Third quarter revenues were $33 million. This included $17 million from Creditex and $16 million from CDS clearing. The downward trend in CDS has required that we develop a more efficient and electronic execution business that is well positioned for the expected CDS market recovery. And while clearing has slowed along with the execution business, we believe that the implementation of mandated clearing early next year will reverse that trend.","We remain the leader in CDS clearing with $35 trillion in gross notional cleared through October, over 370 cleared products and open interest of nearly $1.6 trillion.","We will continue to build on our lead in CDS by offering additional new products such as CDS Index Futures and by enhancing our clearing services with, for example, portfolio margining, which is pending regulatory approval and which is a critical element of clearing for buy back clients.","Next on Slide 9, I'll highlight a few enhancements to our reporting as a result of the swaps to futures conversion.","Volume for our transition contract is now reported daily via the ICE website. On a monthly basis, we'll report detailed energy volume, as you can see in this morning's volume report. With the transition, the third quarter will be our last to include an OTC energy average daily commission number. Instead, ICE's rate for contract for energy now includes all prior ICE Futures Europe contract, plus those that were formally OTC swaps. This should provide more visibility into our revenues throughout the quarter.","Another change related to the move of the bulk of our OTC business to futures is that we will most likely consolidate our segment reporting into a single segment starting in the fourth quarter. We believe that each of these changes will provide you with greater real time information and a streamline approach to modeling.","I'll conclude my prepared remarks on Slide 10 with a review of our balance sheet and cash flows.","ICE continues to generate consistent cash flow and maintain a strong balance sheet. In the first 9 months of the year, we generated $573 million of operating cash flow and we ended the third quarter with $1.2 billion in cash.","In September, our repurchase authorization was increased to $500 million, and in the following month of October, we purchased over 100,000 shares of ICE stock. We will continue to pursue repurchases given our expanded authorization, but our primary focus remains on organic growth and disciplined M&A to produce consistently strong returns on invested capital.","We have continued to make strategic investments this year that will further distinguish our performance and opportunity set for years to come. We remain focused on deploying our capital in a manner that we believe will provide the optimal return on investment to our shareholders. I encourage you to review our earnings release for additional guidance, and I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A.","Jeff, over to you.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Thank you, Scott. And thank you, all, for joining us today. Our thoughts are with our colleagues, customers and all those that have been impacted by the tragic effects of the storm as they continue their recovery efforts. I would be remiss if I did not mention ICE's efforts for backup and continuity leading up to and through the aftermath of the storm. Thanks to the efforts of our team, ICE's market operated normally. Our tested backup systems were utilized to ensure readiness and all of our offices followed our contingency plans to provide for continuity.","So thank you to our team, many of whom were personally impacted by the storm, for both their preparation and their work to ensure that our markets remained available for service.","This morning, I want to update you on the many initiatives underway here at ICE. We, again, outperformed our sector amid significant regulatory and economic uncertainty. However, our culture is not one that makes plans for or accepts excuses for average performance or low growth rates. As you might imagine, our current results are not consistent with our long-term expectations and as Scott noted, our downside bonus accrual adjustments reflect our pay-for-performance culture. We continue to focus on strategic opportunities that will enhance our ability to drive growth as we move through the significant headwinds of this last quarter.","Our successful transition from swaps to futures just 3 weeks ago took place as planned, and provided much-needed regulatory certainty for thousands of customers at a critical time. Our transition decision was a result of significant feedback from the marketplace that was gathered over many months. And the ICE team worked tirelessly to inform our customers as we undertook this significant move on an expedited basis.","Given the complexity of the new swaps regulation regime in the United States, customers uniformly agreed that futures markets were best served their hedging and risk management needs in the energy and commodity space, allowing them to operate in a highly-regulated regime that they know and understand. This transition marks an evolution of our market structure, beginning with ICE's electronification and standardization of the bilateral OTC energy markets beginning in the year 2000, with the addition of clearing in 2002 and with the incorporation of position limit and increased regulation in more recent years.","We have had consistently positive feedback from our customers despite a very dynamic time for U.S. rule makings, a time which included no less than 12 press releases from the CFTC in the 24 hours leading up to a delay of the effective date of key swaps rules as third parties requested release in order to have time to reposition themselves in response to ICE's leadership.","I want to recognize the efforts of our customers and the brokerage community who contributed to the incredible success of moving a huge OTC market into a regulated futures regime over a single weekend.","On Slide 11, we highlight a few additional areas of focus within financial reform. The time line for completion and implementation of rule makings in the U.S. is largely occurring in the first half of 2013. Out of the swap definition rules that were passed this summer and the requirements that they triggered, came a preference for futures markets in contracts where standardization already exists.","In January, the swap dealer threshold will come into effect for energy and agricultural swaps. The CFTC confirmed that exchange of swaps for futures trades do contain a swap contract that will count towards the $8 billion swap dealer threshold.","ICE offers this EFS option in our new energy futures market in addition to screen traded futures, futures block trade and screen-based crosses. It is, however, a shrinking portion of the market's volume and is already less than 2% of our energy business.","The demand for the EFS transaction-type is quickly being replaced by futures trading.","Position limits have been another closely watched rule making in the U.S. While the new regime was recently struck down by the courts, ICE continues to oversee our existing position limit and position management regimes. The market is looking forward to the finalization of SEF rules, which are expected by year end. Indications are that voice trades will continue to be an acceptable form of trade execution.","Creditex, our leading interdealer brokerage firm for CDS and bonds will likely file as a credit SEF once these rules are finalized. In the meantime, Creditex continues to develop efficient electronic trading tools.","Also, we have previously stated that we anticipated registering as a SEF in the energy space and our continued interest in doing so will now depend on how the final rules impact the market's demand for electronic swap execution facilities. We believe that ICE is certainly well positioned if there is to be an electronic component, but customer demand will be determined by the details of the final rules.","Last month, ICE launched the industry's first swaps data repository. ICE Trade Vault is currently processing all CDS trades that are submitted to our clearing house. Once next year's compliance deadline go into effect for commodities trading, we will also begin processing energy and commodity trades.","Scott mentioned that we expect more certainty in the U.S. CDS clearing requirements by year end with industry compliance phasing in during the first part of 2013. And in Europe, we anticipate greater certainty around derivatives clearing provisions in EMIR by year end, also with the implementation in the first half of 2013. We expect that EMIR's impact on ICE will largely mirror our existing efforts around swap clearing and swap data repositories. Where EMIR may differ, even if temporarily, is in regard to the possible capital requirements for central counterparties, some of which have been proposed by the European banking authority.","ICE's clearing houses are well capitalized and we have ample access to credit, should we require additional capital. However, we do not anticipate that any additional capital needs will be material to our earnings or to our financial flexibility.","Net-net, we see global regulation codify much of what is already in place or is coming into place very soon at ICE. Whether it's clearing, transparency, reporting or customer collateral protection, we are very well positioned to continue to lead in the provision of these requirements.","With the regulatory environment now becoming much more transparent and manageable, I want to look ahead to our core growth drivers on Slide 12. These are some of the factors that drive our confidence in our business. Not only are some of these drivers helping us deliver the outperformance you see today, but they offer confidence for continued expansion of our markets around the world.","Because ICE is the home to a number of global benchmark contracts, we are not confined to geographic markets. Our secular growth is driven not only by demand for commodities, but by demand for risk management tools, as well as greater market transparency and access.","This quarter, our years-long initiative to expand our options business played out. Our open outcry -- options trading floor transitioned exclusively to the trading of screen-based options. 50% of our agricultural options were traded electronically at the end of 2011, and that number grew to 90% by August of this year. With the ability to expand our distribution via the Internet, ICE has become a key venue for options trading.","Similarly, in the energy markets, Brent option volume was up 349% in the third quarter. We followed this up with our acquisition of WhenTech during the third quarter.","WhenTech is a widely relied upon options trading technology provider across commodity markets. We're expanding this technology across ICE to all of our adjacent markets and this initiative is just one example of the meaningful impact a small but strategically important investment can have for us.","We have a number of additional initiatives that we believe will continue to shape our business in the coming quarters. For example, we believe that CDS Futures will help expand credit risk management to firms who seek to hedge their credit risk and do so via futures, thereby, broadening the market.","As we've seen in other markets, futures can drive liquidity in the underlying market. And so together with mandatory clearing, we believe the swaps market will benefit. We are also working to leverage our clearing experience to non-deliverable, foreign exchange products in the coming year. And in the commodity markets, you could see here that we set out a number of additional growth drivers.","With regard to energy, you could see the strength of ICE's oil markets on Slide 13. ICE has continued its decade-long trend of becoming the global oil marker, pricing over 2\/3 of the world's physical oil. And we expect to continue to grow in our oil markets.","ICE Brent Futures and options daily trading volume is up 18% year-to-year in the first 10 months of this year, and our open interest is up over 100%. You could see the growth of our total energy swaps markets prior to their transition to futures in the lower left-hand chart here. These results demonstrate the continued demand for the capital efficiencies and liquidity that our markets offer.","Our strategic approach to driving growth and shareholder value is to seek opportunities that keep us at the forefront of secular trends. Our focus on customers' evolving needs have paid off. And you can see on Slide 14, ICE continues to deliver growth on top of growth, and that includes double-digit earnings growth through the first 9 months of 2012. So whether you look at revenue, EPS or profitability, these metrics are a result of a conscious effort to provide great solutions to a sophisticated customer base.","I'll conclude on Slide 15 with a summary of the metrics and objectives that are key to growth and value creation.","Year-to-date, we again delivered record volume and revenue. In the third quarter, we reached an agreement to become the majority shareholder in APX-ENDEX in an effort to create efficient gas and power markets in Europe. We delivered technology for a major fixed-income platform in Brazil. We increased our options capability with the acquisition of WhenTech. And we launched the industry's first swaps data repository.","Most importantly, we successfully transitioned our energy swaps markets to regulated futures markets, and we did all of this while outperforming our sector on financial metrics. ICE had a significant list of achievements in just the last 90 days' time. You can see that we're not sitting still, waiting for the economy to improve. My colleagues and I continue to execute because markets play a vital role in every business cycle and we see many ways to continue to evolve and transform markets.","I'd like to close my prepared remarks by thanking our customers for their business in the third quarter, but most importantly, I want to thank you for your willingness to work with ICE to evolve the markets that we serve.","I also want to thank my colleagues at ICE for your hard work and for remaining focused on serving our customers' needs.","Operator, with that, I will now turn the call over to you to moderate our question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rick Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I guess, the first question -- it's similar to the question I asked last quarter, is on the capital, Scott, and capital built. And you did come through with what you described. You said there was potential M&A opportunities, and obviously, you announced a couple transactions. I guess, the question is, are there similar opportunities going forward? Jeff mentioned that he didn't see the capital requirements being material in Europe. When -- could you expect an acceleration of sort of a capital return at some point, or are these opportunities still out there, these bolt-on acquisitions?","Scott A. Hill","Yes, I don't think much has changed in the 3-month period since the last time you asked that, Rich. I think our thinking is still the same. We did increase, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our buyback authorization, to $500 million. I think you'll continue to see us return capital via that vehicle. We do believe that there still is a lot of growth opportunity in this space. You saw it with the WhenTech acquisition, you saw it with the announcement of our intention to acquire a controlling share in APX-ENDEX. So -- and in addition to the growth opportunities, there are still some uncertainties. The same ones that we talked about last time. There are tax quality questions that are left to be unanswered or that are left to be answered, in addition to a number of other questions like regulatory capital. As Jeff mentioned, we don't expect those regulatory capital requirements will materially alter the strength of our balance sheet or materially alter our P&L in any way, but as we sit here today, the items of uncertainty that we talked about last time and our view that there's a lot of growth opportunity left in this space, really hasn't changed. But I'll close as I did last time. This is something we spend a lot of time thinking about internally, something we talked about with our board as recently as September and something that we feature with them at each of our board meetings during the year. So we'll continue to look at it, but I do think the kind of headline is, lots of opportunity to grow, and as long as we think we can do that and generate the kinds of returns we've done historically, we're going to continue to make those investments.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then Jeff, you talked about Creditex potentially being a SEF. And, I guess, the question is why doesn't ICE just -- do you need to be a SEF at Creditex? Your former partner, [indiscernible], they got a DCM license and they're going to be trading swaps with just the exchange license. So I guess, yes, the question is you've got the, now, the index futures products and CDS, why doesn't ICE, just itself, go more aggressively on the over-the-counter side?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, first of all, we are being incredibly aggressive in the way we've been approaching the credit space. The negotiation to license the market indices was a negotiation that happened over many years. It's a vision that we had at the time we bought Creditex with our former partner that we thought that the markets would become more transparent, more standardized and ultimately, cleared. And you will recall that we were saying that before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which collapse fundamentally changed the regulatory environment, that is also pushing towards those goals. We don't know what a SEF is, and so, the reason that we say we intend to become one and not that we are definitely becoming one, is that we don't know what a SEF is. If a voice brokerage operation qualifies as a SEF, then obviously, we would register our voice operation as such. It has a separate broker-dealer embedded within it, which we use for bond trading, which is the underlying of credit default swaps and is increasingly being used by CDS market participants. So it's actually just an organizational path. I will tell you though what we have done, Scott alluded to it a bit in his prepared remarks. But we have transitioned our U.S. index business to exclusively electronic with no voice intermediation in it. We have convinced the major dealers to stream prices to us and do that fully electronically. And that puts us in a good position for the launch of CDS Futures where we think the market will be accustomed to market making in an exclusively electronic format. And so all of that has been a long-term goal that we've been working behind the scenes to prepare for the day when we can launch our credit futures, which we think will be a very well received product.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First, I'd like to start on the OTC market. How do you think the competitive dynamics play out in the OTC energy market once new capital disclosure rules go into full effect next year? It seems to me like your and CME's models, OTC models, are converging, and I'd just love to hear your thoughts on how the changes that you and CME are making impact where clients are trading and the growth rate of what has historically been your OTC platforms.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Sure. That's a good question and it's complicated, so I'll just try to hit the highlights. The market, when we started ICE, was completely not organized and not standardized. And we put an electronic platform out there to just bring bilateral execution, and it just so happens that we designed that platform to be a central limit order book with FIFO matching, that's first person in, best price matches. And that -- our energy markets have become more standardized around that platform, particularly once we had it clearing, and have gotten used to trading on a central limit order book. ICE, over time, started to publish the data that came off of that central limit order book. At end of day, obviously, there are end-of-day settlement prices that come out of the clearing house and we would sell a view-only version of that central limit order book so that people could see the take in real time. So moving to futures is really just the final step in that process. The market has gotten used to a real time take, it's gotten used to a central limit order book, it's gotten used to clearing and it's standardized. And I would just say to you that unlike other markets, ICE trades, for example, 5-year deals, 1-year deals, quarterly deals, monthly deals, balance of month, weekly deals, balance of week, daily deals, balance of day, so we have every possible tenor of contract that allows a dealer or somebody who's building a customized swap for a unique buy side customer to take all of these building blocks and put them together and build something that is highly tailored. And that process of creating all those tenors and liquidity in it has happened over a decade. So we believe that the market seamlessly converged on futures trading. Right now, we're in an interim period where we have lowered our block trading rules to make it very, very easy for off exchange deals to make their way in, but increasingly, we think the block trade rules will be rationalized between us and government and find a balance and we think more and more business will move onto the central limit order book. Similarly, in the brokerage community, brokers moved from year 2000, where they were inter-dealer brokers, they seamlessly moved over time to become, not only inter-dealer, but dealer-to-client brokers. And under Dodd-Frank, there is a requirement that brokers increase their certifications of their individual brokers, increase their data and compliance functions and so, the movement in the intermediary market was already moving towards becoming full-fledged futures brokers. And we now see our colleagues in the brokerage community as a result of our action moving quickly to get themselves set up to trade around our futures platform. I think, obviously, we are very competitive with CME in certain markets and I would expect that competition to continue and I would expect CME to take steps to organize their markets similar to ICE and we will continue to fight each other for market share.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then as a follow-up on carbon, open interest, I think, at 1.6 million contracts, buying was up a lot, September year-over-year. How do you feel about 2013? It seems like a lot of things are going well under the circumstances, but there's a number of pending rule changes and meetings that could heavily influence policy and ultimately, trading volume. So are you kind of leaning towards the optimistic in terms of volume kind of exploding? Or are you kind of cautious and it's kind of a wait-and-see based on set-aside and some other rules that are being talked about?","Scott A. Hill","We always lean towards optimistic, Ken. And I think the emissions market is not really any different. We actually are quite encouraged by what we've seen in volumes over the course of this year. As you know, we're heading towards the Phase 3 implementation next year. But even in advance of that, we're starting to see big industrial companies move into the market. The trading activity from those industrial customers has been very strong, it's what helped drive the 13% volume growth that we saw in the most recent quarter. We -- I think some of the first auctions for the emissions certificates are scheduled to take place in the near future. I think those auctions will create more price volatility, and price volatility tends to be good for our volume. And so as we look at it, there is no question that you're going to see expanding participation. I think, with the options, you'll see expanding volatility. There are questions about what actions the government may or may not be wanting to take with regards to pricing and trying to influence the cost of our certificate higher, and it's never optimal for markets when the government plays a big role in it. But nonetheless, on balance, I think we're very optimistic on what we've seen and quite optimistic about where we think that market potential is.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jillian Miller with BMO Capital Markets.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Back to the CDS Futures product, this isn't the first time that CDS Futures has been attempted that you guys tend to only to launch products when the market participants really want them. So my feeling is that this time, it's going to be different. So maybe you can just walk us through what the draw of the CDS Futures product is. And then also why you think the dealers are going to be more supportive of this kind of competing product this time around.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Sure. A couple of things that are different right now than we've seen in past attempts. One is there's been a lot of regulatory change. And as we sit here today, we have a better view into how regulation globally around credit is going to play out. So there are people that recognize that trading in a futures environment is a regulatory regime that is respected around the world and is known and understood around the world, and is likely to overcome the fear that exists in the new form of regulation that will exist in the OTC market. Secondly, we have seen where well-designed futures contract helps stimulate growth in underlying markets. And so in terms of the dealers, we're spending a lot of time with major dealers and with major buy-side participants and we're laying out a number of different alternatives that we have in mind on how we could evolve and unfold the market. So we're getting a lot of balanced input from the client base, and there is definitely interest and excitement about putting a product out there that will help grow volumes. We've seen, since the Lehman collapse, a decline in the trading of derivative products in credit and an increase in trading the underlying cash products, that being bonds. And as you know, the bond market is a complicated market. With the capital rules that are coming into play now, it's going to be hard for dealers to keep inventory of bonds and it's not a particularly efficient market. So generally speaking, when you see those kinds of attributes, people prefer to trade a listed derivative and therefore, that's why we're seeing more and more interest in this particular product. I think last thing I would say to you is that we're going to be very, very thoughtful in the way we roll out these products, the timing and the specific design of the products, with an idea of building an entire credit franchise over time. And so we're taking our time doing it. I expect that we'll have more to say on our next earnings call about the specifics.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. That's helpful. And then I just wanted to get your thoughts on some of the high frequency trading regulation that's going on in Europe. The minimum resting time provisions contained in MiFID II, at least the parliament draft, seemed to, at least from my reading, apply to kind of all financial instrument traded on exchange, potentially including derivatives. And I just wanted to get an idea for kind of how you view the scope of that role. And then if you do think it may apply to derivatives at some point, what extent, or I guess, what is the extent of the impact on your trading markets potentially?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Sure. Well, first of all that whole rule and the discussions around high frequency trading in general is subject to a lot of debate and is very fluid, so it's really hard to know. Our position is that government should not be mandating how technology should work. No one knows what the unintended consequences of resting orders are. I suspect that it's good for some market participants and bad for other market participants, and it doesn't solve the problem. We have been trying to be constructive by demonstrating the kinds of things that the futures market and ICE specifically has put in the market that has made high frequency trading on our platform very beneficial to the market, and we don't think it's provided negative implications. And where we believe it has, we've taken steps to prevent it. So we block certain kinds of trading behavior. We don't even allow that trading behavior of certain types into our market. We penalize people who are simply using high-frequency trading to do sort of fishing expeditions and we analyze the individual behavior of high-frequency traders to see whether or not they are adding liquidity or taking liquidity from our markets. And by developing very targeted programs that, and in our case, in our futures markets, we tend to have a limited number of seats that we make available to high-frequency traders, and we tie their access to those seats to certain behavior that we want in the market. So I think if you look at that in total, you would see that those high-frequency traders are taking the place of liquidity providers that used to exist in the markets, either on the telephone or on open outcry trading floors and they're an important part of the market. So we've been constructive in that dialogue. I think by describing that, it answers the second part of your question which is, these market participants are important to us. They are not the driver of our volume growth. Our volume growth is being driven by access to the for risk management and hedging by end-users, but they are an important part of creating the liquidity to match the time differences between when a end user wants to buy and a second end user wants to sell, and that is the real value of having that liquidity. And so we are not that dependent on it because we are in more control of it than most exchanges.","Operator","Our next question comes from Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Jeff and Scott, I just wanted to revisit the double-digit revenue in earnings growth targets. I know you hold yourselves to a really high standard and we can see that in the reversal of the comp accrual this quarter. But just looking forward and across all your businesses, how would you prioritize the 3, 4 drivers that re-attach you to that double-digit top line growth rate that you want?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, it's a goal that we have that we hold ourselves to and we haven't changed that. If you just look at -- what -- so I'm in a unique position as the senior leader here that I'm taking down the bonus pool because we measure ourselves by our shareholder return. But this year alone, we've moved this major asset class into futures. We've finally rolled out and matured our -- this multiyear effort that we've had to bring options from the telephone onto the screen. In fact, we migrated all of our Ag options to the screen and we're able to take cost out of our futures business by closing the open outcry trading floor. We've got this new swaps data repository that's working for credit. It will soon expand into commodities when the law pushes that. We've got this multiyear negotiation of a license with market that has finally concluded for the launch of credit futures. We've built in new capabilities for legally separating customer assets in our clearing house. We've built our clearing house to do non-deliverable forward FX. We've built out our clearing house with new modeling and rules to handle sovereign CDS. We have built out a bond platform both in English and in Portuguese and launched it in Brazil. We've pushed on our BRIX exchange down there and dramatically raised the volume of electronic trading. We've fully electronified our OTC credit business in the U.S. Index area. We launched new agricultural futures. We agreed to buy the majority of APX-ENDEX. We've acquired WhenTech. All those initiatives are the things that management and our colleagues here can do to put solid growth drivers ahead of the business. And in that long list of things that we've accomplished this year, I'm confident that there are a lot of solid singles that are going to continue to drive growth. Beyond that, I think if you just step back and look at this quarter, this was a unique quarter in that -- in August, it seemed like our trading world stopped. There was a combination of the Olympics, people going on holiday. Because of fatigue, it became a risk-off marketplace. There was concerns about what would happen in Europe when Europeans return from holiday in September. We had this unknown about how Dodd-Frank was going to affect the U.S. swaps markets and commodities. And all of that sort of manifested itself in August. And since that time, we've seen increased growth, and as Scott mentioned, our OTC business, just prior to our conversion to futures and the storm, was back up to $1.6 million a day, which is about on par to where we were last year. So we think our core business will continue to grow, notwithstanding that list of 12 or 15 new initiatives that I went through that I think will bring future growth.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. Jeff, that's really helpful color. And then just switching gears over the regulatory side. Thanks for the update. I just wanted to follow up on your comment regarding the recent ESMA CCP recommendations. When you say you don't think that increases your capital needs or impedes capital flexibility of ICE, are you implying that you just touch up the debt to EBITDA target for the company? And could you just frame some numbers around how you're thinking about that?","Scott A. Hill","Yes, it's -- we're still a little bit early, Howard, in trying to figure out exactly where those numbers are likely to fall out. But I think to be very precise, what we're saying is given the cash balance that we have and the financial flexibility that we've got, that even at the highest estimates of what the additional regulatory capital requirements may be, it won't change our financial flexibility, it won't materially change the cash balance we've got, it won't impact our P&L and it won't get in our way of making the other investments we need to make. So the numbers that we've calculated are fairly wide range, which is why I'm not going to toss them out there until we know with some greater certainty what they are, but the key point from us is we've given ourselves enough flexibility with the strength of the balance sheet and the strength of the cash balance specifically, that we're not worried that those regulatory capital requirements, even if they go up $50 million, $100 million, $150 million, will change, in any meaningful way, our ability to invest in growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Great. I guess, Scott, a couple numerical questions. First, what was the severance in the quarter? As I think you quantified that as being what the bonus accrual reversal was. And then what's your starting point, just remind us again, for 2011, end of period guidance for expenses so we think about the year-over-year growth?","Scott A. Hill","Yes. So the severance was roughly 2.5. The reduction and the bonus accrual was -- were almost identical. I mean, they literally offset each other. So 2.5 up, 2.5 down net loss in the quarter. And look, I'll just -- I'll be very precise. In the fourth quarter, I expect spending is going to be somewhere between $130 million to $134 million. If you look at the base, the only adjustment we make in '11 is for the Cetip [ph] onetime fee that we had in the third quarter, so the base is somewhere around $528 million, $529 million, which flat to 2 would suggest a quarter in the kind of $130 million to $134 million range.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just kind of building upon the kind of the outlook, I guess, a couple of comments from both of you that you expect kind of a return to normalcy, kind of as we head into the new year and get some clarity around the regulatory stuff. So I mean, is this -- is that coming from conversations you've had with the customers you're seeing, and I guess, in some of the activity levels in October, and so you kind of expect that just to continue as we get more of the rule making kind of complete?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, let me -- if you think about our core business now that we've transitioned to futures, we -- whatever happens in Dodd-Frank, the final rules on trading, as it relates to our footprint in commodities, is almost irrelevant to us. And so I think our customers now trading at fully futures-type market are going to continue on. What we've seen in the dealer community -- in the Wall Street dealer community where there have been changes in capital --  changes on the desk because of perceived capital needs, to the extent that anything has gone down there, it seems to be immediately picked up by other market participants. So the commodity space, because of the how evolved it is and widely distributed it is and global it is, seems to be able to continue on and that's what gives us some confidence. The one OTC market that we remain in is the credit market, and we've laid out, obviously, this goal of launching credit futures for that market, and that, I think, will bring growth next year for us. So from a regulatory standpoint, we're sort of playing on a different ball field.","Scott A. Hill","You can go business by business and see, in each of them, a reason to be optimistic about where 2013 can be. What I talked about in my prepared remarks, Ag open interest is up 5%. That is still the best leading indicator of subsequent Ag volumes. Emission volumes are very strong. I answered earlier that we've got a good confidence as we move to Phase 3 that, that will continue to improve. There continues to be a material shift from TI to Brent and we're seeing OI build there. We see our share build every day. In OTC energy, I mentioned October was better than September, which was better than August. In CDS, we've had European sovereigns approved by the FSA. We're awaiting the SEC approval right now. We have mandatory clearing starting in the first quarter of next year with the buy side and the portfolio margining that's critical to that offering. We expect to be approved by the SEC in the not-too-distant future. So in every one of our businesses, we think there's an opportunity for growth. And importantly, what we've done this year is we really aggressively managed our investments right at those key growth opportunities. So not only do we think we've got a lower than anticipated expense growth this year, but I think the run rate, as you get into '13, is likely to yield a relevantly modest growth in '13 as well. So to the extent we get the growth, that growth on the top line will only be amplified at the profit line.","Operator","Our next question comes from Roger Freeman with Barclays.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","What percent of the customers in the OTC contracts have been converted to futures so far that the traders have actually started trading them as such? And are they doing it -- are they switching over completely or still kind of testing it out? And also curious, have you seen anything interesting with respect to trading behavior and mix so far relative to what you thought?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, interestingly 100% of our customers has shifted over. We did a big survey. We triangulated around the market before we made the announcement, and we were convinced that 100% would shift. And so it went seamlessly over a weekend. We no longer offer any OTC trading except for bilateral trading that's done, and those are largely more physical markets where people still trade bilaterally. But the bulk of our markets are now futures and everybody's shifted over. What we've seen is service side relief and growth in the volumes of those markets relative to what was going on before the transition. And so I think it's a credit to a lot of hard work here by a lot of our customer-facing people at ICE that help people get set up. And also, we made changes in our technology that were seamless and were able to implement those over a weekend and move everybody's positions over and move the compliance teams and what have you into a futures regime over a weekend.","Charles A. Vice","And this is Chuck. I would just add, too. I think while Dodd-Frank is, obviously, a U.S. regulation, there were some important global benefits to us in this change. One, we have historically offered all of our swaps on a U.S.-based ECM, CFTC-regulated. That includes a lot of swaps that are more European and Asian-based and oriented. So this change allowed us to convert those to futures, but also move them to ICE Futures Europe under U.K. regulation, and I think both geographically and regulatory-wise, a little more appealing to that customer base. The other benefit, while Jeff mentioned in his prepared remarks, the swaps dealer determination is being a big driver for this change. The other one is the extra territoriality aspects of Dodd-Frank, and a lot of uncertainty remaining around the U.S. person definition. And so what we were seeing amongst our European and Asian customers was a lot of who typically should not be affected by Dodd-Frank, a lot of concern about what happens if I get matched up maybe knowingly or maybe unknowingly depending on the method of execution with a U.S. person. Is it an affiliate of a U.S. Bank? Is it a foreign affiliate of a U.S. Bank? Is it a U.S. affiliate of a foreign bank? And so forth and so on. And so that relief Jeff talked about amongst the customer base, when we converted to futures, I think was not limited to U.S. customers, it was global.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then just secondly and lastly, you might have talked about this earlier, but on sovereign CDS, on the peripheries in Europe, where do you stand on that? I know there's an article in Bloomberg on Friday you were saying you're going for SEC approval. Are the European regulators close on that? I know you were waiting on that because the market wasn't stable enough.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","We've got, Roger, FSA approval and we are awaiting final SEC approval before we can launch.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So just a couple of little things to follow up on. Market data. I don't think you mentioned this before, but while you had decent growth year-over-year, it declines on a quarter-over-quarter basis, which I think is the first time we saw that. Any particular things going on there? I guess, you'll usually say more, more customers coming on the platform is, where actually some people had left, or what's going on here?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","We -- if you look over on a year-over-year basis, it was way up -- it was down a little bit, $1 million on a $36 million number quarter-to-quarter. And the things that I look at that I've talked about before whether it's new market IDs, new people coming onto the platform. All of those continue to trend up as we look at it. So my expectation is you'll continue to see the market data line of our revenue grow on a year-over-year basis and in any slight decline from 2Q to 3Q is likely momentary.","Scott A. Hill","And Alex, I would mention to you that one of the major changes to our business when switching our OTC products to futures is the way market data is accessed. And so we have had to move our market data into a futures-style regime, which is different than the way we were selling OTC data. And so there was a period here where we were having to come up with new agreements and new methods on how we were going to monetize that data. Generally speaking, it should be about the same, but the details are different. So there was a lot of that going on during the quarter, which we hope is behind us now.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, good. And then secondly, also a follow-up, I think, to Rich at the beginning, on the capital side. Maybe you can talk a little bit more specifically on the buybacks in case I missed that before. Obviously, you bought something a little bit back in the third quarter here. I mean, the stock went from $140 to $130, so I assume that was opportunistically. But going forward, I think your guidance also implies that the share count could come down again a little bit more. So do you think there will be a healthy amount of buying back here going forward, or is it still more of a stock is attractive, let's buy a little bit? Or how are you thinking about buybacks in particular?","Scott A. Hill","Yes. No, that's a good -- there's nothing implicit in our share count guidance with regards to buybacks. You don't have to go try and figure that calculus out. We didn't buy any back in the third quarter. We got a new authorization at our September board meeting to move up to $500 million, and then immediately in October, bought back 100,000 shares, spent a little over $13 million doing that. But as I would characterize, as we have historically, our repurchase activity is being largely opportunistic when we feel like the share price disconnects from its fundamental value. As I mentioned earlier, our primary expectation with regards to capital is that we can continue to put it to work to invest to grow and generate solid returns.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with ISI Group.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","A question for Jeff. Could you comment -- you talked about the transition to futures from swaps in the energy space. But can you talk a little bit about your expectations for trading velocity on those futures relative to the legacy OTC contracts both maybe in the sort of the near-term, say, over the next 2 to 3, 4 months, and then structurally, longer-term say, 1, 1 to 2 years? Do you expect a big improvement in velocity or should we expect a significant improvement in volumes based on that?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","At the margin, yes, because -- just simply because futures will have a wider distribution sort of by market design. For example, we were limited as to who could have access to our screen. With futures, you can go all the way to the retail investor. And secondly, our OTC platform was a principals-only platform, which meant that the principals had to push the button and there were no broker intermediary. And now as brokers become members and set up to trade futures, we can have broker intermediary. So in that regard, I think the distribution alone should allow the velocity to go up. We had allowed some algorithmic trading in a certain small number of our markets that were highly liquid. I don't think that will change. And generally speaking, we have hundreds of markets now that have become futures and many of them are just not conducive to algorithmic trading in general. So I don't think it's the algorithmic component necessarily that's going to drive that velocity. I think it's the distribution.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So it sounds like we could see that relatively soon then, given the expanded distribution.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","I think so. We -- one of the things that's going on and you saw it in the request for delays at the CFTC was to quickly get brokers certified to trade futures. That means that for many individual brokers have to take a Series 7 or Series 3 exam and become registered, and put compliance systems in place, et cetera. So there's a fair amount of movement going on in the brokers community to get set up, and they were not that well prepared unfortunately for our transition. But I think as they come in to the market, you're going to see them, for the first time, having user IDs and passwords and pushing the button on behalf of their clients.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just lastly on the tax rate, it looks like we were trending about 30% in the first half. Now, about 28% for the second half. If we come to a full year of 29%. Should we be thinking of a 28%-ish tax rate given how we -- with the consistent business mix going forward into 2013, or do you foresee something different than that?","Scott A. Hill","I think the range we've given you previously had been 28% to 31%. I think that's probably the right range to keep in mind. As you indicated, we were expecting closer to 30% through the first half. It's now, for the full year, closer to 29%, which is why we trued up in the quarter to that number. But I think the prior guidance of 28% to 31% is likely to hold certainly for this year and then as we look to 2013. Although if the U.K. continues to take its corporate tax rate down and continue to improve its corporate tax rate, we certainly will benefit from that as we're seeing the faster growing parts of our business are in the U.K., outside the U.S.","Operator","Our next question comes from Niamh Alexander with KBW.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","With regards to credit derivatives and the futures, it is quite an exciting opportunity. You didn't disclose that it was an exclusive license, but I assume that we won't see other exchanges with access to these indices. What can you share with respect to helping us model, think about the opportunity? Is it something where maybe you might be paying a licensing fee to the other participants like market and the dealers or is it more like shared economics on that business unit like with the [indiscernible]?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","That's a good question. I don't exactly know what we disclosed, so I'll just say that we -- it is a licensed fee to market for their intellectual property, and is the kind of thing that is typical in the futures industry. And there are -- if we both do our job and can create some valuable trading for the 2 companies, then ICE will be the home for that trading.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Fair enough, Jeff. And then on MiFID. You talked about EMIR earlier on but MiFID II is still in kind of negotiations. I know you've got some questions on high-frequency trading, but from what we saw -- I mean, one of the proposals we were kind of watching too was, in effect, kind of suggesting maybe open clearing or requiring that you open up your clearing house to maybe competitive products, and that seems to have gotten watered down. Is that something that you are encouraged by or you're kind of still not in the -- what are your thoughts on that section?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, we're actively involved in the dialogue over there. And the concern we have is that if the remedy for making sure that we don't have an interconnected banking system is to interconnect a bunch of clearing houses, then we haven't done anything. And so we've been talking about just the unintended consequence of having access that would allow the market to just relink and become codependent on each other in a different manner and not create the firewalls that, I think, clearing was intended to do. You're right in that it is an ongoing dialogue and discussion, and a lot of the stuff is very, very technical and complicated and we're having to deal with European legislatures that have not seen these issues before, so the pace is kind of slow and the number of people involved is large. But we are encouraged by the direction, and we've been received well and people have been willing and interested in hearing our views and learning about these kinds of details. So that's always a good thing as legislation's being crafted. But we expect to -- do we care? We don't want to put excess risk in the system, particularly risk that we have to manage. But when we ran our energy markets -- our OTC energy markets, we accepted trades from 150 different venues. Today, in our CDS clearinghouse, we're accepting trades from dozens of venues. And so we also have, obviously, futures contracts that are traded on a central limit order book that is a vertical. So we have both models and have been successful in both models, and we'll react accordingly. As Chuck mentioned, when he spoke, we took the opportunity of converting our U.S. OTC energy markets to futures, to also convert our foreign OTC energy markets to foreign futures. And that was not a Dodd-Frank, necessarily directly related to Dodd-Frank, but we think the trend in the marketplace is for standardized contracts to be traded as futures.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Heinz of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","You mentioned the need for more efficient means of execution in CDS, and in light of your recent product announcement on the CDS indices, clearly, it seems you believe that indices are well-suited for a future. So I guess, I've kind of interpreted this to mean that you envisioned somewhat of a bifurcation in the execution models for index and single name. And with single names kind of remaining on the OTC side and -- do you think I'm on the right track here? And if this is the case, what could that mean for capital efficiencies and cross margining between the 2 products?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","It's a very good question and really, what we're trying to do and you're trying to do in your question is predict the evolution of a market. It is very, very clear right now, in the OTC markets, that we have major firms streaming real-time prices in the index complex and matching up on a central limit order book-type match. That is not the case in single names. There's electronic trading around, particularly ICE, on our Creditex platform, tends to be broker-intermediated. There's a lot of indicative pricing. There are a lot of rules around how that electronic -- yes, well, rules are what they call protocols in this space. But they're basically rules on how things get executed in the single-name market. So it is not yet that evolved in the OTC space. As we develop index-type credit futures products, it will, I guess, remain to be seen whether or not that drags along certain types of single-name products. You could imagine that certain names in the single-name complex or certain sovereigns in the single-name complex might be bellwethers and be used as indicative of industries as opposed to indices, but I think that will take some time. But the most important thing that we're focused on is having our initial launch of index futures be a successful launch, be well received by both buy side and sell side and provide real value so that we can have a flagship that can drag along other business. In terms of cross margining, we're still waiting for even cross margining in the OTC market between index and single names, which is really held up by regulatory action, not necessarily by the way risk should be managed because the indices in CDS are simply a collection of single names, so they decompose, if you will, they're not necessarily continuous readjusted indices. And so that's our first priority, and as Scott mentioned in his prepared remarks, we think that will -- we will get approval for that soon. And then once we have that all going and we see how the market likes that decomposition and [indiscernible] we can figure out how to introduce the futures contracts, which will be an important element of making sure futures and OTC can have capital efficiencies.","Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just following up. It seems like the swaps to futures transition on the energy side doesn't necessarily change a whole lot for your customers, your domestic customers, from an operational perspective. But I'm wondering if there's something we might be missing on your international customers in terms of accessibility for regulatory restrictions. I'm pointing back to the time when I think I heard you say that there was a lot in flux with the regulatory regime in China with regards to commercial hedging. And I'm just wondering if there's any alleviation that takes place with the transition.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","That's a very good question. There's positives and negatives going on outside of the U.S. with our transition. The positive is that in China, mainland Chinese traders were not able to access the foreign OTC markets, only foreign futures markets. So the fact that we have moved a big group of important Asian OTC products into futures gives us better ability to access China directly. And we already have screens in China and people in China doing business on our flagship energy products, and this will then bring the balance of our portfolio to them. The negative side that's going on is that the brokerage community that serves the OTC market in Asia has been the community that's had the most issues on getting set up to trade futures. There are licenses that are required, certifications and other things, particularly in Singapore that, that community was not that well prepared for. They're rushing to get certified. I've met with the Singapore government personally, we've written letters to the government asking for help in moving the brokers through the certification process or giving them temporary relief as they move through that process. And our meetings with the Singapore government -- we've had multiple meetings now at very senior levels, and they are interested in what we're doing and see the benefit. Singapore, I mention, because it had been the out of -- in the non-China area where Chinese companies had come to do OTC business. So it's important that we get that Singapore community set up for futures so that they can further penetrate into Mainland China.","Charles A. Vice","The only thing I would add to that is, I think from an access standpoint or an access agreement standpoint, those Far East markets, they may be interested in ICE Futures U.S. markets, ICE Futures Europe or our OTC markets, so we've effectively reduced the number of kind of agreements or access points from 3 to 2. And in the case of energy customers in the Far East, virtually all of them were already active in our Brent, Gasoil, our other futures -- legacy futures products at ICE Futures Europe. And because of the nature of OTC trading Jeff mentioned earlier, principals only, we as an exchange have a higher obligation to know the end-user, futures models a little different, intermediated through the FCMs. And so to the extent a given customer in the Far East doesn't want to be an exchange member, for example, it's fairly easy, probably, a little easier for them to become a customer of our exchange than it would have been to, say, sign an OTC participant agreement. So I think net-net, we've reduced the amount of overhead it takes to access those markets.","Operator","Our next question comes from Akhil Bhatia with Rosenblatt Securities.","Akhil Bhatia","Just one quick question on the expense guidance, Scott. If I look at year-to-date expenses of $405 million versus the $528 million last year, it kind of implies $123 million on the low end. Is that the right math?","Scott A. Hill","No. As I mentioned in our earlier answers, our base line from last year is around $528 million to $529 million, flat to 2% would imply $530 million to $540 million. I think, as I mentioned earlier, and in the spirit of trying to be helpful, you should expect somewhere between $130 million and $134 million in the quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Rutschow with CLSA.","Robert Rutschow - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on the CDS, it sounded like from your commentary, that there is some value in having side-by-side trading in derivatives and cash. And so I'm wondering if that's -- if I'm reading you correctly. And what the initiatives are in terms of build versus buy to build out more of a cash trading platform?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Sure. Well, first of all, when we acquired Creditex, we acquired a bond desk that was there. And like everything that we do, ICE is really good at investing and building technology, so we have continued to build tools for our bond desk that ultimately resulted in us having a very, very high-quality bond trading platform to the point that our partners, Cetip in Brazil, wanted to license that platform from us. And I will tell you that we are a minority shareholder of Cetip, and so Cetip did an industry review to look for the best platform for them, and we were able to convince them that our bond platform was exactly what they needed and that we would undertake difficult complicated prospect of converting it so that it worked for Brazilian markets and was accessed in Portuguese, which we have done. So we do have that underlying platform. Our bond business does do well and we are not necessarily going at the naked bond trader. We tend to go after people that are doing complex derivatives where there's a combination of bonds and CDS and we can do a good job of providing that whole package to them. I do think that as we develop credit futures, I think the credit market desperately wants credit products that are widely accessible. And I said for years that I think that credit is an under-traded asset class and part of that is it's complicated products and access. And I think we can help solve that, and if we do that right, it will drive, not only growth in some of the over-the-counter markets, but also in the underlying bond markets.","Scott A. Hill","And just to give you a number on that, our bond desk at Creditex in a world where everything in CDS is shrinking, is actually up double digits year-over-year.","Robert Rutschow - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. The follow-up would just be there was a fine for Barclays. Do you expect any change to your power markets as a result, and was there any impact in the quarter from that?","Charles A. Vice","We didn't have any impact from the quarter. I think that was from trading back in '07, '08, '09, it was fairly dated. I think there's been a number of -- JPMorgan, I think was another one in Barclays, kind of similar situations. I don't think that, that has been an impact at all into our swaps markets. As far as the physical markets in power, those, some time ago, migrated over to the ISOs, the regional markets that kind of quasi governmental entities operate, and they're largely driven by supply and demand. So I don't know -- I don't think we have seen any impact from that.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Or would expect to.","Operator","I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back to our host for closing remarks.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, thank you all for the time you spent with us today. We look forward to reporting on our next call, our full year results. So with that, we'll say goodbye and have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's presentation.

All participants will be on listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Warren Gardiner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Warren Gardiner","Good morning. ICE's first quarter 2019 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of theice.com. These items will be archived, and our call will be available for replay.","Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements which we undertake no obligation to update represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2018 Form 10-K.","In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures including adjusted income, EPS, operating income, operating margin, expenses, effective tax rate, free cash flow and EBITDA. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP terms in the earnings materials and explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful; as well as how management uses these measures in our Form 10-Q.","When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction based expenses, and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain terms.","Also, with us on the call are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Ben Jackson, our President.","I'll now turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Hill","Thanks, Warren. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4, with some of the key highlights from our first quarter performance. ICE's consolidated first quarter net revenues totaled $1.3 billion, up 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Trading and clearing net revenues grew 5% and data revenues increased 6%, each on a constant currency basis. This strong revenue performance help deliver the second best quarter of earnings per share and free cash flow in our company's history.","First quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $528 million including, roughly $7 million non-recurring benefit and comp expense. Adjusted for that, we would have been at the low end of our guidance range at around $535 million. Second Quarter adjusted expenses are expected to increase to be between $537 million and $547 million largely driven by the full quarter impact of annual merit increases in equity grants. We then expect each subsequent quarter to increase sequentially by about $3 million to $5 million, reflecting increased technology investments and spend related to Bakkt. Incorporating all of those dynamics, we are now lowering our full year adjusted expense guidance to a range of $2.15 billion to $2.18 billion.","I'll pause here to note that in the first quarter, we recognized $19 million of non-operating income related to a true up for OCC's 2018 results. Additionally, unlike last year, we did not receive a dividend from Euroclear in the first quarter. We do however expect a dividend of around $20 million in the fourth quarter, a 40% increase from the dividend received in the first quarter of 2018.","Shifting to capital return, we deployed over 95% of our free cash flow to dividends that once again are increasing by double digits and share repurchases. Of note, the $440 million distributed via share buybacks in the first quarter included an additional $100 million, we opportunistically spent to repurchase shares at an average price of $75 during the month of March. The nearly $600 million in total capital that we returned during the first quarter has only been surpassed by the second quarter of last year, when we similarly deployed an additional $160 million to repurchase shares. We remain committed to strong capital returns, a dividend that grows as we do and opportunistic repurchases even as we continue to make key strategic growth investments.","Now let's move to Slide 5, where I'll provide additional color on the performance of our trading and clearing business. First quarter revenues were up 3% year-over-year or 5% on a constant currency basis. In our energy markets average daily volume was down 12% versus the prior year, as trading in the U.S. natural gas markets and the Henry Hub in particular suffered from lower levels of price volatility. Participation in the Brent and gas oil markets was negatively impacted by a combination of various geopolitical uncertainties and supply\/demand dynamics.","As you will note though, the volume declines were almost entirely offset by an 11% improvement in our average rate per contract. The improved RPC reflect strong volume growth in our European natural gas business, were ADV increased 42% in the quarter as well as our emissions business were volumes were up 35% that strong performance continued in April and more importantly, overall energy open interest continues to grow and is up 3% versus the end of 2018.","In our financial futures market, while interstate volumes were impacted by Brexit and an uncertain European economic backdrop, MSCI volumes improve by 9% year-over-year. Importantly, while interest rate volume has been somewhat muted April to date, open interest continues to trend higher up 11% year-over-year as at the end of April.","Moving to cash equities. Volumes increased 9% year-over-year in the first quarter and market share improved roughly 25%. Wrapping up with our fixed-income and credit business, revenues totaled $87 million in the quarter. This compared to $56 million last year and includes the addition of TMC and MERS, both of which were acquired in the second half of 2018.","Turning next to Slide 6, I'll discuss our data and listing segment. Starting with listings. Revenues of $111 million, were up 2% year-over-year, while the U.S. government shutdown delayed IPO activity through the end of January. The NYSE helped raise over $2.5 billion of IPO proceeds during the quarter. In addition, the second quarter is off to a strong start. With year to date proceeds raised now in excess of $5 billion including the Pinterest IPO in April. Both Uber and Falck have also recently announced their choice of the NYSE as their listing partner.","Moving the data. On a constant currency basis data services revenues grew 6% year-over-year to a record $546 million. In pricing and analytics revenues increased 6% over the prior year. The automation of fixed-income workflows and the growth in passive strategies is continuing to drive increased demand for our evaluative pricing services both real-time and end of day as well as our reference data and our index offerings.","Exchange data in these revenues grew 8% year-over-year driven by growth in the number of customers using our futures data and improve market share at the NYSE, which determines the revenue we received from the share take plan. And finally, desktops and conductivity revenue was up 3% versus last year. Conductivity services related to our futures exchanges generated solid growth benefiting from the aforementioned increase in our customer base. Mitigating this strength conductivity revenues related to the NYSE were roughly flat. As we continue to rollout our pillar technology, which we expect will improve efficiency while reducing industry costs.","We believe the momentum in data revenue growth will continue in the second quarter with revenues expected to increase sequentially to a range of between $550 million and $555 million. Our competence is supported by an annual subscription value that was 6% higher than a year ago entering the quarter. 2019 is off to a great start. The resiliency of the business model we have constructed is evident and our ability to deliver the second best earnings and cash generation quarter in our company's history despite a challenging backdrop for industry trading volumes.","I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff Sprecher","Thank you, Scott and good morning to everyone on the call. I'll begin on Slide 7. Our first quarter performance highlights the value of the organic and inorganic initiatives that have undertaken over the last year.","We've been engaged in a deliberate evolution to add growing subscription-based revenues and to increase our addressable market by expanding our asset class coverage. Despite softer trading volumes across our industry in the first quarter, and as a result of this evolution, we grew revenue, earnings per share and free cash flow and we returned nearly $600 million in capital to our shareholders, the second most in any quarter in our history.","10 years ago, we were largely commodities trading venue. At the time, roughly 85% of our revenue was transaction-based. Today, half of our business is recurring revenue in nature and spans a diverse set of asset classes. Asset classes that we think are well positioned to continue to grow. At roughly 30% of our business, commodities markets still remain an important component of our growth profile.","We offer a full spectrum of risk management tools that are critical to the daily hedging and trading needs of global energy and agricultural commodity market participants. Global benchmark contracts such as Brent crude oil, Gasoil, sugar and European natural gas, the name of few, Anchor what is the industry's most diverse commodity in complex.","Our financial markets businesses home to futures on global interest rates and equity indices, such as the MSCI index complex, where we recently launched a suite of new indices as we partner to expand the range of risk management tools offered to our customer base.","In our cash equities business, the New York Stock Exchange stands as the leading provider of listing and trading services. We are the listing venue of choice for the world's largest and most sophisticated company, and as the deepest liquidity pool for equities on the planet. The NYSE provides customers with a state-of-the-art technology platforms helping to reduce volatility as well as reducing their trading costs.","In our fixed income business, an asset class that now represents about 1\/4 of our revenue with the leading global provider of a value to pricing and reference data. Our pricing and reference data business is also the foundation for our index business and for our comprehensive suite of pre-trade and post-trade analytics. This suite of data services together with its institutional customer connectivity, it's highly complementary to ICE bonds. Execution venues that offer our customers choice across execution protocols including auction, click-to-trade and RFQ convention.","Demand for automation in the fixed income markets is accelerating, and whether it's through initiatives such as our ETF hub or new data products such as real time pricing curves, best execution analytics or indices. Our platform of fixed income assets is uniquely positioned to capture this growth trend.","Similarly, the U.S. residential mortgage market is experiencing an analog-to-digital conversion. It's an evolution that we've seen before and much like in other asset classes, we're providing products, services and key infrastructure aimed at facilitating that transformation.","Digital mortgage solutions are gaining traction. The electronic mortgage notes or eNotes are an important step towards a fully electronic mortgage ecosystem. And in the first quarter alone, more eNotes were registered on MERS than in all quarters of 2018 combined. eNotes can bring meaningful efficiency gains to the industry by shortening closing time, improving quality control, and helping to reduce friction. And with eNotes representing less than 1% of the outstanding mortgage is today. The opportunity for future growth is substantial.","Turning now to Slide 8, as you may have seen last night, we announced the acquisition of Simplifile. Simplifile is the leading provider of electronic recording services to the mortgage industry, helping to streamline the real estate transaction process. It operates one of the largest mortgage networks connecting originators, settlement agents, servicers and counties. It's a network that's been constructed over two decades and includes transaction recording counties that together represent 80% of the U.S. population.","With the electronification of the mortgage industry, and its early innings of transformation, the number of eligible documents that could record digitally is four times the size of what Simplifile currently handles. When combined into ICE mortgage services, we will be better positioned to address the increasing demand for digital mortgage solutions, helping the mortgage industry reduced costs and making the closing process simpler, faster, and more transparent.","Turning now to Slide 9, we remain committed to balancing our growth today with ensuring that the groundwork is laid for growth tomorrow. An example of this is our effort to support the development of an institutional market for digital assets. Based on feedback from institutional investors seeking a way to participate in this nation asset class, we're building out key infrastructure starting with a custody platform.","Secure custody of private keys on Bakkt will feature the high level of cybersecurity oversight that protects our global markets, coupled to the regulatory structure of a qualified custodian or which Bakkt has now applied. Earlier this week, Bakkt announced and it acquired the digital asset custody company to further scale its capabilities and also announced that it is working with BNY Mellon to enhance its physical security and geographic diversity of custody.","Bakkt is building a strong team, including senior leadership with experience from ICE, PayPal, Vantiv, Worldpay, Coinbase and Google Wallet. And Bakkt remains focused on launching physical delivery futures on our ICE futures U.S. exchange to enable trusted pricing within the digital asset ecosystem and to facilitate institutional adoption.","In summary, we're excited about the addressable market that we have in front of us, and while our business is certainly larger and more diverse than it was only 10 years ago, we're still guided by a management team that operates in sync and we are growth focus. Our integrated platform enables us to drive efficiencies across our technology and our operation, while still significantly investing for future growth, which is clear in our operating margins of nearly 60%. And our footprint provides us with unique foundation to drive growth, while continuing to create value for shareholders.","So I'd like to thank our customers for their business and their trust in the quarter. And I want to thank all of my colleagues for their efforts that contributed to another very strong quarter price. With that, I'll now turn the call back to our moderator, Sherry, to conduct the question-and-answer session and that will last until 9:30 Eastern Time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Mr. Michael Carrier of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Michael Carrier","All right, thanks and good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just the first question, some of that fixed-income business, you guys have done well on the data side. I think on the trading, the team is a bit more competitive with some of the encumbered platforms out there. So how are you thinking or strategically how are you differentiating between the other platforms that are already in the market in order to win over the next few years?","Ben Jackson ","Thanks, Michael. This is Ben Jackson. And I think Jeff captured it in the comments that he was making in his opening script there. In that the key differentiator that we have is the scale and size of our fixed-income business when you look at it as a vertical and it represents now 1\/4 of our revenues across our entire revenue base. So think about a $1.3 billion business. And if you look at the cornerstone of that $1.3 billion business \u2013 in that is really our data businesses.","The data businesses that we've established with pricing, reference data, index and analytics capabilities that we provided to customers for more than three decades, data businesses and data services are very hard to establish with customers. You have to have a long track record of a trust for them to trust that you as a benchmark price that they're going to references it takes a long time to establish the credibility in our relationship. And it\u2019s both institutional relationships that we have solidified over multiple decades that really is our differentiator that we're going to leverage as it comes into execution.","For execution platforms themselves, we've seen similar performance to what you've seen from the other platforms that have recently announced. We had strong performance in corporates, in U.S. corporates, we've seen trade sizes increased. We have seen a little bit of relative weakness in municipals as the spread between municipals and treasuries has narrowed. And treasuries have coming to favor but we have seen treasuries perform very strong on our platform.","So net-net our platforms what we've done in Q1 is we have fully integrated our ICE bonds business to now execute as one business. We restructure the organization rationalize and take some cost out and now have a single vision to leverage the institutional relationships that we've established over multiple decades. So that's really what you see as our differentiator.","Michael Carrier","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","The next question is from Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Rich Repetto","Yes. Good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Scott. And first thanks for Slide 7, Jeff has guided. It's been we have an experience watching the company expanded over the years. So anyway my question is on what you've schooled us on Scott, the annual subscriber value for market data and went up nicely. But again, you talk about this what we're working on right now is 2020 revenue for market data. And I guess the questions \u2013 I know you've accelerated the growth from the low single digits to the 4% to 6% now. But as you go forward is there any \u2013 as you add this annual subscriber value is there any momentum \u2013 anything to point that you can grow it faster than the upgrade you have right now? And is it still coming from the same sort of buckets that you talked about when you \u2013 a couple of years ago when you first gave some guidance on good growth there?","Scott Hill","Yes. Thanks for the question, Rich. And I do think the ASV is a good metric to focus on because it is forward-looking. As I proved last year, it doesn't give perfect forecast but it's directionally very indicative. I think the key thing you see not just in ASV but in the growth trends we've established. Our compound growth rate since 2015 through the end of 2018 was just under 6% every year on average. This quarter we grew 6%. That's the third quarter in a row that we put up 6%.","And if you look at our guidance for the second quarter, we're again going to be kind of in that 5% to 6% range at the midpoint being around \u2013 right around 5.5%. So it's a growth trend that's been consistently delivered in ASV indicated it can continue. And it can continue because some other things that we've talked about in the script, there are a lot of tailwinds in the fixed-income space. There's a move from active to passive management.","There's a move that Ben spent a lot of time talking about towards bond ETFs, which if you look at relative to equity ETF is a much smaller space, but one where everybody is pointing to a strong future. And so I think in the fixed-income area and that's largely our pricing and analytics business which you've grown 6%, 7% ever quarter for the last four or five quarters, it's really those trends that have driven it and continue to drive it.","I think if you then look at the exchange data and the connectivity piece, again, I go back to the remarks I made, we continue to see more customers wanting our data and connecting to our platform. And so our connectivity services related to futures exchanges was up solidly again this quarter. Our futures exchange data was up again this quarter. And that goes back to the nature of the commodities business the futures business that we offer.","We offer a global set of interest rates that are subject to European economic and European Central Bank dynamics and Federal Reserve dynamic. We offer commodities and energy space that most comprehensive global oil market, the most competitive global natural gas market, the most comprehensive global ag market and we continue to see commercial customers, who are managing their price risk exposures in our market and that drives a demand for connectivity and for exchange data. And so again, I would suggest to you, you've been seeing that in the growth results we put up, I think it's definitely reflected in our first quarter and second quarter guidance and I see \u2013 I think you see it in the ASV which indicates that those trends continue.","Rich Repetto","Okay. Thanks, Scott.","Operator","The next question is from Mr. Patrick O'Shaughnessy of Raymond James. Please go ahead, sir.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy","Hey, good morning. To follow up on the first question on your fixed-income business, is there any quantification you can provide regarding customer growth or average trade size? And kind of metrics that you can provide what's that \u2013 what indicate that you're progressing along your goals?","Scott Hill","Thanks, Patrick. I think \u2013 as I mentioned we've seen relative performance to what you've seen from the other platforms this past quarter with corporates being strong and municipals in particular seeing some relative weakness. If you look at our platforms, we do have a bit of a tilt in our mix towards municipals. So we did see that impact the businesses to some degree. But all that said, trends that we've seen and as we're leveraging the rest of our businesses to really move into the institutional space some of the metrics that I've said in prior calls that we continue to see is trending very positive is the development of our RFQ capabilities to move into the institutional space and RFQ represents close to 20% of our trading volumes on a day-in and day-out basis.","We continue to see \u2013 and continue to develop that and continue to see customers utilizing that. We have on our platform on any given day over 10,000 securities that have prices of $250 up on either side. So that it\u2019s real indicator that central limit order book trading in fixed income is starting to develop. And we look forward to continuing to provide customers choice on central order book trading options through our click-to-trade protocol in addition to our RFQ capabilities that we have built out on the back of a long standing capability that you've had in all of our futures markets and being able to provide that protocol as well. So it's \u2013 those two pieces and leveraging the institutional relationships that we have across our business that we believe well positions us to continue to change the mix of assets that are trading on our platforms and also increasing trade sizes.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy","Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Dan Fannon","Thanks. I guess one more on fixed-income. Just to make sure that we're thinking about what your goals are. I guess what is the kind of right way to gauge success? Is it because we don't really have market share we're not getting clean data yet? Is it aggregate revenues? Or I guess what just kind of holds you accountable in terms of that success? What should we think about as a goal post as we think about the remainder of this year or even further?","Jeff Sprecher","It's a good question. This is Jeff. It\u2019s complicated press because we don't run our businesses the way we recorded them on the chart. In other words, we have an integrated management team and we are running all those businesses together and honing the common technology platforms where we can do it in common sales and marketing efforts. But if you step back the goal post that we set internally as senior management, I referenced in my prepared remarks, that 10 years ago we are a very different company. We were sitting here around 10 years ago thinking, wow, there's going to be an analog-to-digital conversion in fixed-income. How do we participate?","And we were pretty knowledgeable. We are very knowledgeable about markets, because this management team has been together a long time and our team had a lot of international cross border experience. And we decided to go right for the high value part of the business. The high value part of the business is in mature markets is not the execution. And I can tell you a very mature New York Stock Exchange has 12 other exchange competitors and five more that are rumored to be signing up and some estimate as many as 50 different venues, where you can execute trades on U.S. equities. The high value part of the business is getting those institutional relationships getting your data, your connectivity, your higher value products on the people's systems, it's very hard when you're running a fund to change your benchmarks, to change your underlying data as people consume information that it perpetuate through organizations and becomes institutionalized.","So in looking at fixed-income market and the difficulty that we all had in our industry are how to digitize that. We decided to start with where we thought the higher value part is. So you've seen growth, Scott talked about ASV and we talked about our company as a data company and how that is performing. The reality is what you're really seeing there is those fixed-income trends against a very, very weak market for commodities and equities in other asset classes in the quarter.","And so it's why we decided to try to better show you how the business operates. We'll take it away that other metrics that we can put out. We don't run the business that way. So it's hard we don't have those metrics at our fingertips. I'll just make one other point which is, 10 years ago we were in the interest-rate business and we had a very formidable exchange competitors like CME and Deutsche B\u00f6rse and LSC and at that time NYSE Euronext that had very strong interest-rate franchise. So what did we do? We looked and said the nature part of the market where there's no analog-to-digital conversion yet its mortgage, that's the interest rate market that we should go after.","And so we're starting to see some of the decisions that we made 10 years ago play out and it implies spent a little bit of time talking about Bakkt and digital assets. I don't know where did that company will go, none of us knew, but we have the luxury in this company of a being have an entrepreneurial team and the ability to make investments that are very strategic and still maintain our operating margin given the technology footprint that we have. So anyway that's the overarching theme here and we'll take away specific metric interest and see if we can come up.","Dan Fannon","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Mr. Jeremy Campbell of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Campbell","Hey, Thanks. Jeff, just piggybacking on that mortgage commentary there, I mean, now with MERS and Simplifile can you just provide some color how ICE mortgage services fits within the existing kind of mortgage technology infrastructure? So for instance, I think of like Black Knight that has something like 80% of mortgage services on their technology platform, with also a large origination technology platform. Is something like that a partner for ICE mortgage services a competitor or just an entirely different stereo of influence?","Jeff Sprecher","It's very good question. So when we bought MERS. MERS was really \u2013 is a company that registers if you will paper-based mortgages. It gives every U.S. mortgage, Mortgage Identification Number, all the MIN number Mortgage Identification Number and that's for paper-based e-comm system. What we did is over two years we built the digital ecosystem and we worked with Fannie and Freddie to hook that digital ecosystem to them as an endpoint. And we started with these eNotes that we mentioned, which is essentially stock mortgage, it's all loan document. Can we get the industry to digitize the essential loan document and send that to Fannie and Freddie? Now \u2013 and to each other to the extent they want to.","Now we're going to have Simplifile, which says, okay I can send that same mortgage to be recorded as a closing. So we're starting to build the backend of endpoints if you will. There are a lot of companies out there that have digitized at the frontend, there's a very competitive market when you arrive go get a mortgage today we may be on a digital platform or we talking to somebody in an office that\u2019s actually typing into the digital platform. It's highly competitive space and those and well worn in the industry itself to sort of start the time to figure out how to automate the frontend.","We would hope that we're going to have an open API on this network that we're building. We're hoping that those people will plug-in what they're doing and onto our network, so that those essential digital documents can be codified and recorded. There are literally hundreds of documents that exist in the world that go into a mortgage. Your mortgage provider last year tax return they want to see 1099, they want you to go various forms are somewhat unique to them, they want past employment history, they may do a credit search.","All of that stuff, if there is an industry that\u2019s trying to organize that as you mentioned and it's in various states of way. But largely in today's world, that\u2019s all gets printed out into paper documents and put in boxes and store it somewhere. And there's so many different fields that are entered into on those forms because that they're not that standardized. There are acronyms and conventions and things that are hard for people to translate to bring that whole file together.","And so what we've done and said, let's start with the nugget, the essential core, which is the actual note itself and then allow we'll build some of it and we\u2019ll have this network build with others can plug-in to it. And let's try to get the entire industry standardizing around our network if you will which will be the essential way to close the transaction.","Jeremy Campbell","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Mr. Kyle Voigt of KBW. Please go ahead, sir.","Kyle Voigt","Hi, good morning. Maybe a switch gears to the trading business. I know, you're seeing some really good growth in global oil and other energy products. But Brent is still the large futures product by revenue and we've seen some soft open interest threat throughout the past two years there. Just wondering if you can talk about why you think we haven't been seeing some of the same type growth more historical growth rates in Brent at least we have the past two years? And if there's anything in the horizon that could we reaccelerate those growth rates?","Ben Jackson","Hi, Kyle. It's Ben. Thanks for the question. And yes, we have seen what we view as a temporary pullback in open interest volumes in Brent. And I think which you can point to is a lot of this happened in particular in the last two-three weeks. You can point to a lot of very unforeseen events that have recently happened. Things such as removal of waivers against the Brent oil sanctions, new bands being implemented on Venezuelan oil and now the potential for contagion in Russian oil, all of this has led to a pretty uncertain environment for traders.","And while you'll hear us as an exchange operator and others, point to times of volatility be great for volumes was not great for volumes is complete uncertainty. And an area where there is a complete unforeseen event that happens which tend to see and what we've seen over time is the traders will go into a risk off mode and they\u2019ll take a step back, assess the situation and tried to form a view on directionally where the market is going. And we think that's what we're seeing in Brent itself.","But you touched on an area that we're seeing that we are seeing growth and it's made up of significant amount of the pull of that recent temporary pullback and that's in that global oil complex. And when you think about what is that global oil complex, you've got a whole suite of products that basically hang off of Brent, Gasoil and our WTI business. So these are products that are very precise basis locations for people to hedge risk at a point of consumption or a point of production in North America, in the Middle East, in Europe and across Asia. You see complementary spread in differential contracts between Brent and Gasoil and these contracts. You also see refined products spreads. So a barrel of oil versus refined products that come off of it oftentimes called crack spreads.","We've seen significant growth in this part of the complex with open interest up 6% year-over-year and volumes up 18% year-over-year. So when you combine this whole complex as one global oil business with over 500 contracts that have been developed with our commercial traders at the core you see a complex that's priced two-thirds of the world's oil. It has led and continues to lead in open interest market share and has gained market share over the past year and that's a global complex that includes both futures, options, and all of our oil products together. So we're going to begin to work with our commercial customer base to build that out.","Kyle Voigt","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alex Blostein","Hey, guys. Good morning. Just another follow-up around the mortgage business, can you guys update us on the \u2013 I guess the revenues and expense contribution from the Simplifile business that you bought? I think the press release just mentioned strong track record of revenues, revenue growth and profitability just trying to pencil out what that is? And then Jeff definitely helpful summary of kind of what MERS is and kind of what it does? But again maybe update us on what the revenue there stands today? And I guess bigger picture how does this business ultimately going to leverage ICE's data and trading segments? Or is that meant to be really almost kind of like a standalone part of what you guys do?","Scott Hill","Thanks for the question. I'm going to take the numbers part and then I'll hand it over to Jeff for the important stuff. So just quickly just in terms of the numbers Simplifile, we literally just signed it yesterday. And as we mentioned on the press release, we don't anticipate it closing until the third quarter. What we will do as we typically have is once we've closed it we'll update our guidance and give you the expense and the revenue associated with it. What I can tell you is that, when I give the expense update particularly if it's only in the fourth quarter and I'm hoping we could contain it in our current guidance and it'll be more than offset by revenue because it is a profitable business.","So more to come on that, once we get the deal closed. And as we said in the press release that that will be sometime in the third quarter we anticipate. In terms of the MERS revenue, we actually had a strong first quarter. The business tends to correlate a little bit or I guess it's a negative correlation with interest rates. And so with them having moved a little bit higher as we move through last year. There's a little bit of concern it might impact that business.","But as it stabilize the first quarter was actually relatively strong on a pro forma basis little above $20 million of revenue, we're up double digits year-over-year. And so you'll recall that we gave you guidance. I think of revenues $17 million to $19 million in the fourth quarter and we actually did a little better than $20 million in the first quarter. And as I think I mentioned on that call, as is gets to relatively low expense base. So high incremental margins like a lot of the other businesses that we operate.","With that I'll hand it to Jeff to talk about how it fits.","Jeff Sprecher","You're somewhat foreshadowing the ideas that we have here on data and analytics. Once a mortgage has been digitized and the information around it has been standardized so that it's searchable and can be run through analytics platforms. Fannie and Freddie theoretically ought to be able to more quickly get on an underwrite decision that would speed up that process, speed up funds flow and closing. And as Fannie and Freddie layoff risk in the market as they do today, they will allow the third-party that are going to undertake that risk to be able to do more research on the portfolio of mortgages that would be in there.","So we do view that the data component of mortgage will become more interesting and valuable and will help drive down cost and speed up closing times. MERS when we acquired it was essentially a consortium and a membership organization with 5000 members. It has data policies within that the industry agreed to essentially. We've in taking control of the business, we've asked many of the companies that have been involved on the Board of Directors to stay on the Board. So we have representatives from the GSES from large banks and what-have-you.","And really the reason that we ask them to stay on is to continue to contribute exactly to the dialogue that I just mentioned, which is what is the information that the industry wants and needs. How do we deal with PII information as we digitize things and make information more accessible? What are the levels of information that the market needs versus the need to be kept proprietary? Thinking about the expansion of this business globally and into other asset classes of lending. How does it meet the European standards and what-have-you? So those are all PPD future conversations that we started honestly when we first got involved in the business. And there'll be a natural by-product that I think of digitization and standardization's industry.","Alex Blostein","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","The next question is from Mr. Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, sir.","Brian Bedell","Great. Thanks very much. I stay on the MERS topic. I think Jeff or Scott you mentioned about 1% of outstanding mortgages right now are electronically documented through the eNotes system. Can you help us think about the run rate half or the revenue growth half over the long term. Is it most \u2013 is it entirely dependent on new originations? Or is there a path to convert existing mortgage documents that don't have any activity to them electronically in terms of bringing up that mortgage? And then maybe just how many eNotes actually did you register in 1Q? I know it was more of 2018 altogether.","Scott Hill","I'll start with second part of your question, 19,000 eNotes in Q1 still a very small when you think of it in the context of the U.S. mortgage industry is still nascent. But you've seen what's going on underneath that is the early adopters people that are anxious to become more digital have embraces this idea and are moving quickly to try to build it into their workflow. There's a broad cross-section people in mortgage industry that are talking to us and looking at the ATI or figuring out how to build it into their current workflow and it's not unlike any analog-to-digital transition that you witnessed in other asset classes.","So what you see, our early adaptors are getting there quickly as they get in there and start to experience cost savings and ability to serve their customers better it's driving competition. So we are very encouraged by the early results even though it's a low number. The revenue model is simply we charge essentially in eNote on our platform and Simplifile charges the register in eNote and the more that that can all be put into one workflow to make it easy for the lender and mortgage underwriters.","You can imagine that the pace of increase. As for existing documents there are a number of companies out there that are exploring how to go back and digitize existing mortgages. There's a lot of error rate in dealing with boxes of paper mortgages that exists in warehouses when there is a change of servicing rights when there is a foreclosure. And one of the things that Simplifile and MERS has been working on over the last decade is changing local law and what-have-you so that the golden record if you will can be digital that the original mortgage you may recall during the last financial crisis people showed up with global sign mortgages in courts and many judges rejected them.","And as a result MERS the entity that was hoping to find and produce those mortgages on behalf of the original lenders. And so moving to an electronic system with a golden record, which is much like what's done in many other asset classes that can be respected by the courts will potentially be a reason that all these legacy mortgages will be scanned and put into that system. And like I had of the meeting on \u2013 I actually had a meeting on this topic yesterday with a third-party, who wanted to talk about how they can plug into MERS and they would offer this kind of services.","Brian Bedell","So do anticipate being able to get say, bulk transfers of existing mortgages without any activities or no refi or no foreclosure or no new mortgage. Just go into some record keepers and be able to do a giant bulk transfer of those existing paperback to eNotes?","Jeff Sprecher","Potentially the problem is that those records are not standardized. And you need essentially not just the ability to scan but you need essentially artificial intelligence or rules-based engine. That on a document that says, somebody is named Robert and another document has him down as Bobby but that's the same person. And where people have made errors in writing social security numbers down and all this other stuff you can get it pretty quickly into chaos.","So the people that are \u2013 there are people looking at this are trying to figure out is their ability to scan those create an indelible record that will be respected by the courts and in foreclosure and store that record pointed at MERS and the eNote and allow the marketplace itself to better transfer potentially those mortgages between one another particularly in sourcing rights, which happens quite often.","Brian Bedell","Okay, great. Thank you so much for the color.","Operator","There's a follow-up question from Mr. Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill. Please, go ahead sir.","Rich Repetto","Yes. Hi, Just a question for Ben on the fixed-income side. When you're back in to the revenue it looks like for TMC and BondPoint it looks like revenue went down quarter-to-quarter. And I know you mentioned Ben some softness in the muting market but it did look like from a trace volumes that there was a record volume in 1Q. So just trying to understand the actual revenue from the fixed-income on the trading side?","Ben Jackson","Yes, Rich. I tried to hit that on the comments I made earlier where a lot of it has to do with a mix so the municipal space. And our platforms compared to the others that you see out there tend to be more tilted towards the municipal space. And the muni space has had a rough go at it lately. Again given that spread between treasuries and munis has narrowed and treasuries have come into favor. So what we have seen is that treasuries have picked up, but treasuries tend to be at a lower price per transaction.","So what we do see is that with the efforts that we have underway and that I've talked about on prior calls with the ETF hub initiative and the build-out of our RFQ, we are continuing to advance those efforts. And with ETF hub on schedule to be released later this year. We see that initiatives like that as well as the connection that we're building across the institutional businesses that we have. We'll continue to change that mix as well as increase the average trade size that we'll see on the platform.","Rich Repetto","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","It's a follow-up question from Mr. Patrick O'Shaughnessy of Raymond James. Please go ahead sir.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy","Hey, great. Thank you. So Bakkt has obviously some pretty well-publicized delays since you announced the initiative. How do you think about the market opportunity for Bakkt and how that's changed since you really launched the effort?","Jeff Sprecher","Well, to be completely transparent with you it's really been helpful that the cryptocurrency industry sort of went into what they call a winter that took some of the heat off of the timetable to launch. There's been a \u2013 and secondly we've actually been looked at a number of different companies and acquired a company earlier this week that wouldn't have been available to us had the market really been hot because valuations were really hot. So I see this kind of maturation that's going on where for example the people the blockchain engineers that we acquired through our recent acquisition became really interested if you will in affiliating with a larger more corporate if you will effort to move the industry forward.","There's a lot of interest still in this market. It's not when we talk about institutions, the institutions are regulated, the banks are regulated, the regulators are trying to get their arms around this asset class and how to regulate it. And we want to be a regulated venue, which is why it's taken a while. But that said, you can't really get into the true institutional markets that we serve without being highly regulated and highly trusted. And so the juices worth the squeeze in terms of the way and it's going well now.","There were a lot of things that had to get shorted out over jurisdiction and custody and how these \u2013 what will happen in a bankruptcy. And those kinds of issues that in my mind need to be resolved before there's going to be wide adoption of the asset class. And we been at the forefront solving those and building the solutions for those and we're very, very close now to finalizing all of that. So once we're sure this sort of downturn in the value of these assets allowed us to attract some really great people and gave legislators and regulators the time to think about particularly in the United States how to deal with this asset class.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Mr. Chris Allen of Compass Point. Please go ahead.","Chris Allen","Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask a follow-up on the muni market in general. Where does that market stand in terms of electronification particularly in the institutional side? What are the impediments if there are any right now? And how do you see that kind of evolving moving forward?","Ben Jackson","Thanks, Chris. Yes. So the municipal space it is far behind or even U.S. corporates are. So if you look at estimates of the U.S. corporate market in terms of how much is electronic being 20% to 25% but clearly moving more and more electronic. The municipal space is further behind where our estimates are call it 10% to 12% of it are electronic. We are seeing that continue to move more electronic or beneficiary of that obviously.","But the municipal space structurally has been tough for the point that I brought up before with spreads between municipals and treasuries coming down. But also if you just look at muni issuance, if you look back two years ago it's significantly higher than where it is now. Now it's starting to just rebound at this point and as new issuance starts to come around, we should see some benefit in the secondary trading on that. And it takes a while to get behaviors to change from the analog type of transaction. But it's early days but we are starting to see that move as well.","Chris Allen","Has the banks taking any steps towards launch tranche any munis?","Scott Hill","Similar to corporates the dialogues that we're having with banks is that they started certain trade sizes and started small trade sizes and looking to electronify that. And then over time as they get more and more comfortable with it they'll move up that threshold in terms of what's the minimum size that they no longer want a phone involved in that transaction. They want to build more algorithms into pricing those trades, more electronic execution in pricing those trades and municipals are just a few years behind where corporates are.","Chris Allen","Thanks, guys.","Operator","The next question is a follow-up from Michael Carrier of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Sameer Murukutla","Hey guys. This is actually Sameer Murukutla, Mike had to jump off. A quick question related to your thought process around acquisition especially in the fixed-income space. Maybe can you give an update on how you think about the return in increasing goals? Meaning, historically it's been a focus but given some of the structural growth in certain areas would you sacrifice those goals if you think the structural growth make up for it over a longer period?","Jeff Sprecher","I guess, the operative part of your question for me is longer period. We try to be very disciplined about our return on invested capital. We feel like we can pay a premium for a business if we can put it on our platform and quickly grow it or digitize it. And also integrate the business so that if we look generally out three years, we want to start to see very high returns on invested capital. We give ourselves \u2013 we tend to give ourselves three years to integrate a business and honestly internally we try to drive ourselves to two.","And so we want to see very positive results mathematically coming out of that. I'm smiling, because we built $1 billion revenue business in fixed- income. I think without a lot of people realizing what we were doing because we really didn't talk about it in that way. And we were able to acquire key parts of that business at valuations that were incredibly low relative to where people are valuing fixed-income assets today. I'm not sure that the market has recognized that it's partly why we decided to pull the curtain back a little on this call and give you more color on what we look like today. And so I don't know now that that sort of the curtains now that the wizard is visible, I'm not sure that we're going to be able to continue to find interesting assets that deliver on the metrics that I just tried to describe but we're always looking.","Ben Jackson","Yes. I think the only thing I would add to that, as you've heard us talk about our acquisition how does it fit our strategy, how does it enable our growth, how quickly can we integrate it, how many synergies can regenerate, what's the return on investment. You've seldom heard us say the word accretion. Because at the end of the day you can financially engineer accretion you can't financially engineer returns. And if the deal done strategically, you are not likely to be able to get those returns. And so that we showed you the model a couple of summers ago and it was in the case before we showed it to you, it is the case now that it's about strategic fit, it's about growth and its about returns. Those are the things that matter and it's one of the reasons you see our return on invested capital now back at 9% when our weighted average cost of capital is only 6% because we do focus on creating economic value.","Sameer Murukutla","Thanks for the color.","Jeff Sprecher","Thank you.","Warren Gardiner","Well it's 9:30. So with I think we'll wrap up. I'm sorry, Sherry, are you going to wrap it up for me?","Operator","Sorry, I was just going to say, back over to you, excuse me.","Jeff Sprecher","Thank you. Currently I was more anxious to get off the call. But thank you all. It was a great quarter and we'll look forward to reporting our next quarter results soon.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

All participants will be in listen-only mode.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Kelly Loeffler. Ms. Loeffler, please go ahead.","Kelly Loeffler - Senior Vice President, Corporate Communications, Marketing & Investor Relations","Good morning. ICE's second quarter 2016 earnings release and presentation can be found on the Investors section at theice.com. These items will be archived, and our call will be available for replay.","Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our Form 10-K for 2015.","In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including adjusted income, operating margin, expenses, EPS, EBITDA, and tax rate. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance.","In the appendix of our presentation and earnings press release, you'll find a summary of our GAAP results, a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP terms, and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful, as well as how management uses these measures. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses, and adjusted earnings refer to adjusted diluted earnings per share.","As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the year-over-year figures we will discuss reflect comparisons against adjusted pro forma 2015 results.","With us on the call are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Chuck Vice, President and Chief Operating Officer.","I'll now turn the call over to Scott.","Scott A. Hill - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Kelly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on slide four and highlight that the second quarter was our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth. Our performance was driven by revenues that grew 7% and adjusted operating expenses that declined 1% year-over-year.","We generated adjusted operating income growth of 15% and expanded adjusted operating margins by 3 points to 56%. Adjusted earnings per share grew 13% versus the prior year to $3.43 and with continued momentum in our transaction business in July, growing data revenues and lower expenses, we're well positioned in 2016 to extend our decade-long track record of double-digit earnings growth.","As you'll see, as I move to slide five, our second quarter performance contributed to strong results for the first half of 2016. We generated consolidated net revenues of $2.3 billion during the first half of the year. Both our trading and clearing segments and our data and listings segment grew 6% versus the first half of 2015. This solid top-line growth combined with disciplined expense management allowed us to expand operating margins by 5 points to 58% and to grow earnings per share 16% to $7.12.","Additionally, we generated record operating cash flow of $1.1 billion in the first half of 2016 which enabled us to pay over $200 million in dividend even as we reduced our leverage to 2.4 times just six months post the closing of our Interactive Data acquisition.","These strong financial results, enabled by our globally diverse business model, supported our board's authorization of $1 billion share repurchase program and our $0.85 per share dividend for the third quarter. We also announced plans to pursue a 5-for-1 stock split to ensure that our stock trades as efficiently as possible in a fragmented market and that it is more accessible to a broad range of shareholders.","Let's move to slide six where I'll provide some more details in our first half revenue performance. 52% of the $2.3 billion in revenue came from our data and listings segment, and 48% came from our trading and clearing segment. Each segment grew 6% year-over-year. You'll find further detail on each segment's revenue on the right side of this slide.","In the trading and clearing segment, commodities revenues grew 10% with strong contributions from both our energy and ag markets. Financials revenues grew 2% with continued strength in our equity index markets partially offset by muted European interest rate volume. Notably, volume in ICE bread, sugar, other ags, MSCI, and U.S. cash equities each grew double digits during the first half of the year.","Within our data and listings segment, pricing and analytics revenues grew 6% and exchange data revenues increased by 13% year-to-year. This strong performance was enabled by a high retention rate of existing customers, the acquisition of new customers, and the development of new and enhanced products designed to efficiently deliver more value to all of our customers.","Each of our data offerings are benefiting from customers' recognition of the increasing value of readily-available easy-to-consume information. This nascent trend reflects our customers' need to deal with the challenges of the volatile markets and uncertain political and economic environments in which they operate.","We continue to expect our full-year 2016 data revenues to grow between 6% and 7% on a pro forma basis despite the recent significant decline in the pound sterling, in which roughly 9% of our total data revenues are billed.","Further, though we expected currency impact to cause a sequential decline in revenues of $6 million in third quarter, we believe fourth quarter data revenues could approach $500 million even at current spot rates.","Finally, listings revenues grew 3% over the prior first half and we hosted some notable IPOs as activity picked up late in the second quarter.","Going forward, we're confident that our unique market model and strong issuer services will continue to support the capital raising needs of the world's most innovate companies and exchange traded product issuers.","Please turn to slide seven where I'll discuss our disciplined expense management and provide updated and improved guidance. First half adjusted operating expenses declined 4% year-over-year to $970 million and pro forma operating margin expanded by 5 points. As we continue to integrate our acquisitions and streamline our operations, we are realizing Interactive Data synergies sooner than expected. The majority of our corporate functions are well along the path to integration. Our technology and operations teams have built clear integration roadmaps. And perhaps most importantly, the ICE Data sales team is now fully integrated and well-positioned to better serve our customers with a complete range of data solutions.","Given our solid execution, we now expect to realize roughly $50 million in synergies from Interactive Data this year and approximately $100 million in combined expense synergies during 2016. Accordingly, we now expect our full-year adjusted expenses to be in a range between $1.94 billion and $1.97 billion including adjusted expenses in the range of $485 million to $495 million in the third quarter. This updated and improved full-year guidance reflects the $60 million improvement from our guidance at the beginning of the year. This improvement consists of an additional $25 million in synergies and roughly $35 million largely related to the currency impact of the lower pound.","We run a diverse global business that is subject to currency fluctuations. Given the size of the change in the pound related to the Brexit vote, I want to take a brief moment to give you some color on how you should think about this in the context of our second half financial performance.","With roughly 11% of our total revenues and 15% of our consolidated expenses denominated in pounds, we have a natural hedge that mitigates a meaningful portion of the impact to profit. Therefore, even though the currency driven decline in revenue exceeds the expense reduction on a dollar basis, we expect the net impact to earnings to be immaterial and it will not impede our ability to extend our track record of delivering double-digit earnings growth to 11 years.","I'll conclude my prepared remarks on slide eight with a review of our cash generation, leverage and capital return. We generated record operating cash flows of $1.1 billion in the first half of the year and deployed that cash to invest around $150 million in CapEx to reduce our debt by nearly $800 million and to return over $200 million to shareholders through dividends.","We reduced our leverage from 2.8 times at the end of 2015 to 2.4 times at the end of June. We believe that by the end of this year or early next, we can reduce our leverage to a level that will continue to support our strong investment-grade rating even as we increase our capital return and consider other strategic investments. This solid cash generation and rapid deleveraging supports our board's authorization of a new $1 billion stock buyback program and our ability to grow our cash dividend as we grow.","Our record first-half results reflect our commitment to serving customers and generating strong returns for our investors. We are expanding and improving the products we offer in the markets we serve. We are growing revenues, earnings and cash flows. We are reducing expenses, debt and leverage, and we have invested strategically to build a diverse business model that we believe will allow us to continue to deliver consistent earnings growth, solid cash generation and leading returns on investments.","I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A, but for now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Scott, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'll provide an update on our strategy that's delivering the strong growth that we've detailed this morning, and then we'll conduct a question-and-answer session.","On slide nine of the results of our strategic approach to transforming our company into a global financial services leader, since our IPO in November of 2005, we've grown EPS five-fold, and we've grown our share price ten-fold by building on the changing needs of our customers.","Rather than simply retracing the past to seek growth, we've been future-focused on the intersection of financial services and technology to offer more services to our expanding base of customers. We began as an energy trading platform and strategically transformed the company to become a global operator of exchanges and clearing houses, and become a top-tier provider of proprietary data solutions.","This successful evolution of our business occurred despite the financial crisis, evolving regulations, tumultuous global markets and economic cycles. We stayed focus amid these dynamic times on innovating to solve our customers' challenges, bringing solutions long before they were widely appreciated by the market.","This very point is highlighted on slide 10, where you could see the virtuous cycle created by our global ecosystem of exchanges, clearing houses, information and connectivity, which is an unparalleled model relative to more specialized data providers and market operators.","Data and trading are symbiotic and serve as integral inputs into our customers' workflow. For many customers, access to our data drives more trading, which in turn creates the information used for investing, for settlement, compliance, collateral management, reporting and numerous other functions, all of which drive the rising consumption of data.","The services listed on this slide represent solutions across a vast range of our clients' workflow. And because these services are part of an integrated offering, they create a strong value proposition. For example, our markets are widely accessible via the ICE Desktop, Mobile and Messenger applications, which we offer integrated solutions for our customers' trading, information and risk management needs on a common technology platform.","We also offer vast sets of proprietary data for non-exchange-traded fixed income markets, which represent some of the world's largest addressable markets. Today, we're pricing millions of bonds for thousands of customers each day, and within the fixed income markets, invested assets under management continue to rise. For example, exchange traded fixed income funds have quickly risen to over $585 billion, now accounting for 20% of total U.S. ETP assets under management. ICE also has an expanding set of solution to serve active fixed income managers, such as pricing and reference data, continuous evaluated prices, liquidity indicators and best execution identification.","The role of these new services is highlighted around the times of market volatility and the Brexit vote was an example of an event that has reinforced the importance of real-time information tools. In addition, ongoing demand is being driven by regulation, by market fragmentation, volatility and the uncertainty around global Central Bank actions.","You can see on slide 11 that our approach to driving change has produced consistent top-line growth with record annual earnings for the last decade regardless of the economy or the market cycle or commodity prices or the level of interest rates or increasing regulation or the many other headlines and headwinds that have occurred over the last 10 years.","It is such market and economic disruptions that make our risk management services valuable and ICE's performance relative to the broader sector over the same time validates the model that we built to benefit from change.","In that context, I'll say a few words about Brexit, which we view as another opportunity to drive our set of differentiated solutions. We've dedicated meaningful resources to our London operations and for good reasons. The United Kingdom has tremendous location and time zone advantages in global markets. It has a strong set of regulatory and legal frameworks that have promoted confidence. And ICE has a highly qualified team of colleagues that has, time and time again, contributed to our successful navigation of change.","Since the Brexit vote, we've had an active dialogue with senior officials in the UK government to discuss the types of policies that will facilitate our continued investment. We're looking forward to this ongoing dialogue, and we're very optimistic about the government's focus on preserving a competitive climate for business.","ICE also operates exchanges and clearing houses in the U.S., Canada, Singapore and in Continental Europe. Our decision to be globally diverse is a result of customer demand to have choices for important markets in local jurisdictions. We've been open and transparent about our views, that there will be continued fragmentation and balkanization of markets as they've become more electronic and more locally regulated. These trends and unpredictable events, like the Brexit referendum and Central Bank moves, remind the market of the value of having different data sets readily available. And we believe that these factors increase the need for our proprietary data and the relevance for our globally distributed model.","Moving now to slide 12, I'll review the solid performance in our global markets. The strength of our markets is demonstrated by the fact that trading and clearing revenues for 12 of our 13 key markets grew year-to-year in the second quarter. As you can see on the slide, volume in open interest in our crude, agriculture, sterling, and MSCI products is strong and growing.","Another benefit of operating diverse global markets is the ability to gain both exposure and diversification. For example, while European interest rates, which made up 4% of our total revenues, was the one asset class where transaction revenues declined year-to-year in the second quarter, we earned market data revenues from that business. And, importantly, trading and clearing volumes, again, grew by double digits in June and July.","Moving to slide 13, I'll note the 14% revenue growth in our cash equities markets year-to-date, which produced strong U.S. cash flow and enables us to serve one of the largest global securities markets with data and listings. We've continued to improve and enhance this market over the last two and a half years since our acquisition, while growing revenues and expanding market share at the same time.","On the right side of the slide, you can see the ongoing contribution of credit derivatives clearing in both Europe and the U.S. We've seen greater regulatory certainty in the U.S. draw more CDS clearing to the U.S. and away from Europe, with record-level participation from the buy side. I'll note that we're approaching the milestone of $100 trillion in notional value cleared by ICE. Through a great deal of innovation, we now clear nearly 600 credit derivative instruments driving $53 million in revenue in the first half.","Last week, we announced our agreement to sell the U.S. voice brokerage asset of Creditex to Tullett Prebon, which represents approximately 10% of our global CDS revenues. ICE is not selling the valuable electronic post-trade assets of Creditex that helped us support the launch and are a continuing contributor to our ongoing operations in CDS clearing. We're also retaining Creditex's electronic trading assets, as we continue to build on our solutions for the credit markets.","As we announced yesterday, we've seen early traction in our new single-name CDS electronic trading platform called ICE Swap that we launched in June. This is an all-to-all platform for single-name CDS, which has gotten the attention of major dealers and buy-side clients, who are asking for more liquidity and transparency in these markets. So, we've been very strategic with the acquisition of Creditex by leveraging it to create a group of assets that have generated a positive return on that original investment and which continue to contribute to our earnings.","Turning to slide 14. I'm pleased to say that not only is the integration of Interactive Data running ahead of schedule, but more importantly we're well on track to achieve our 2016 revenue growth targets. In June, we announced the reorganization of all of our data businesses into ICE Data Services, which brings together our analytics, desktops, mobile apps, indices, exchange data, and connectivity solutions under a global data brand to serve our customers comprehensively.","While there remains much integration work yet to be done, the early feedback from our customers is that we're on the right track. Our ICE U.S. Treasury Index family has grown with new indices and new customers. They've been selected as the new benchmarks for a range of ETPs now offered by BlackRock iShares, the leading provider of fixed income ETPs; Direxion, a provider of ETPs with over $10 billion in assets under management; and Yuanta Securities Investment Trust Company, a comprehensive financial services firm serving the Asia Pacific region and Invesco PowerShares recently filed to begin using ICE indices in ETP products.","Our revenue mix from transactions-based revenues towards more recurring subscription-based revenues continues to grow as the evolution of the market continues to transfer value to these mission-critical offerings. With a high revenue renewal rate in our pricing and analytics business, we become a key source for consistent reliable pricing and reference data.","We're often asked if the growth of our data business is levered to the head count at the banks. It is not. First and most evidently, our data revenues have grown during and since the financial crisis. While head count in parts of the financial services industry may have declined since that time, the need for information, connectivity and risk management from ICE has risen, consistent with our data revenues. The consumption of data is rising due to secular trends such as the move to indexation, the rise of ETPs, market fragmentation, independent valuation demand, regulatory reporting, real-time distribution needs and automated trading. The sheer breadth of our services and our positioning at the value-added end of the data spectrum gives us confidence in our growth projections.","Turning to our listings business. The market for initial public offerings improved once the volatility of the first quarter abated. The New York Stock Exchange continues to lead in global proceeds rate, including hosting the five largest IPOs by market cap to-date in 2016. Those are LINE Corporation, China Online Education, U.S. Foods, MGM Growth and Patheon. NYSE also was the home for the two largest technology IPOs year-to-date, LINE and Twilio. NYSE Arca continues to lead in new ETP listings and hosts 92% of assets under management. We're working closely with issuers to develop more solutions and value-added services in addition to enhance the market quality.","Importantly, the listings business also drives growth across our trading and data lines. You can see that even as we deliver on our synergies, the NYSE is a growth-oriented business for us, and we're proud of the work that our team has done to strengthen and grow this valuable business.","I'll conclude my remarks on slide 15, where you can see we are very well positioned to build on our decade-long track record. Our strong start for the year was driven by revenue growth, faster synergy realization, margin expansion, and 19% as-reported adjusted earnings growth in the first half of this year. We also generated over $1 billion in cash flow, repaid nearly $800 million in debt, demonstrated our commitment to capital return with a $1 billion share repurchase authorization, and announced a planned stock split.","So, I'd like to thank our customers for their business, and I want to thank our team for their continued hard work.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to our operator, Keith, who'll be glad to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And the first question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First, you had really quite good growth on the exchange data side. Can you talk about why this growth is occurring now? If you look at the numbers sort of last year at this time was essentially flat for all four quarters, but you've seen really huge growth for each of the last two quarters. What's going on?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Ken. This is Jeff. Well, it's interesting because I've tried to make the point on multiple calls now that we believe that the markets are going to become more fragmented, now that they're more electronic and more \u2013 regulation is being put on markets at the local level. And in some of our core markets, what you've seen is some people come in and pay for order flow. And so, what we've done is readjusted essentially our data offering and the way we disseminated and charge for it so that we can benefit from those payments into the market.","So, when somebody pays for order flow, you attract a new kind of trader; and you, actually in our mind, grow the market by bringing people in that want to receive those payments. And those people tend to hang on the primary market in order to receive those payments. And so, what we do is basically have a compact with them that they will receive those payments and pass some of them back to us in the form of increased data revenues. When a company goes in and wants to get paid for order flow, it tends to do one of two things. It either uses algorithms or its own trading style to basically churn so that it is constantly buying and selling but accepting no risk, or they come up with strategies where you can put on positions that actually show up in open interest but they carry no risk.","And so, there have been a lot of talk in our industry about market share. People like to talk about market share. And we like to talk about earnings. And that's why I always start my recent presentations showing you our earnings growth because we have decided that the way to maximize our earnings growth is to participate in that trend with our customers who want to receive payments from others. And so, there's been a big spike-up in that area, and I expect honestly that this is a macro trend that we're going to see more fragmentation due to a number of factors and that you'll continue to see growth in our core data offering.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. That's awesome. Just maybe on a completely separate note, I just had sort of a long-term aspiration of building a swaps-clearing operation for interest rate products. I guess, do you still have those hopes or expectations of getting into that business? Could Brexit actually help you crack that market? And I guess maybe it's been a couple of years since New York, is it still possible to build this operation or if you still want to get in there, is acquisition the only realistic way to do it?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's a good question and a difficult nut to crack in the sense that we do continue to build out continued capabilities in risk management to serve fixed income and interest rate markets, and that is \u2013 that has been a constant source of investment for us, as you've indicated, over a number of years. Whether or not we actually would enter that space on our own is yet to be determined. There is some M&A going on right now, the LSE-DB deal. It's hard to understand what kind of offering that deal will have, given the fact that they're now in two different regulatory jurisdictions. It's hard to understand what the complexities of regulation may be between the UK and the EU. So, that may open an opportunity or it may foreclose an opportunity. It depends on how things play out.","I would also mention to you that the interest rate swaps business in our mind is largely people doing fix-for-floating swaps. In other words, commercial borrowers, like ICE and Scott Hill, who is sitting across from me, may choose to lock in floating interest rates for a period generally five years or so. But in this low interest rate environment, it's hard to imagine that locking in low interest rates is a growth market.","And so, one of the things that we promise is earnings growth and we tend to look for trends where we can position ourselves early to be part of the growth, and it's very unclear whether the interest rate swaps market is one of those markets. So, I say all of that in the sense that we've not made a decision yet on what to do and when to do it, but we do continue to build out capabilities so that we have optionality around that decision.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Awesome. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Yeah. Good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Scott. Congrats on a very strong quarter. I guess I want to follow up on the first question, the exchange \u2013 the increase in the exchange market bid. I don't think I understand the answer. And I guess, to clarify, are there any offsetting expenses to the increase in exchange data? Or, I guess, could we try another run at it, because I'm not sure what you're talking about when \u2013 is it the rebate that you're paying or someone else is paying?","Scott A. Hill - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So, Rich, let me comment \u2013 put a couple of metrics around what Jeff said. I mean, effectively, what he said is there are more people who are more active in the markets that we provide and we've seen that in user growth. We've seen it in the products that we've been able to package up in our data. So, the interest levels have continued to grow. And as we sign up more users, as we're able to offer more information in various forms or various packages of information, we've seen fee increases related to that. And so, that's really help drive the revenue.","To some extent, when you look at our commodities growth in the first half at 10%, that's across the energy and ags, and there's a lot of volatility in those markets, a lot of drivers that are \u2013 and there are different drivers. It's weather in Brazil, its Middle East and U.S. oil issues that are driving oil. And as you're trying to figure out what's going on and evolve (31:15) the world, you need data and you need information. And so, as people see that need, as Jeff was describing it, we see user growth, and we see existing users wanting more information, and all of that's contributed to very strong growth in that business. And the thing that excites me about it is not just the data revenue growth in and of itself, but that data growth coupled with very strong open interest in our commodities business is a good leading indicator, not necessarily for any given month or quarter, but as we look forward, it says the interest in the markets we're serving remains very high with importantly the commercial customers who are actually taking a view on price and actively managing the risk.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And, Rich, let me just be more obvious. If you stand on a corner and hand out $5 bills, a long line will form. If in order to get into that line, you have to pay the primary market $1 so that you can get 4 of those dollars; that is a good trade. And so, what we do is set up to make sure that our shareholders get the transfer of that $1 from the other person's shareholder.","And much of what we've been doing over the last few years and the way we've been building out this data offering and distribution vehicle is set up for that. We firmly believe that markets are going to become more fragmented. It's very different today when there used to be open outcry floors in regional jurisdictions with the name of the city on them, it was very hard to compete. Today, there are a lot of very sophisticated electronic platform operators that can simply pay for order flows and start a market. And so, we believe that there will be fragmentation. We've seen it in the most fragmented markets that we operated in, in the U.S. cash equities market. But what changes there is that as those payments are made, there's an opportunity to participate in them and that's really what we've been doing.","So, we laugh a little bit around here when people put notes out talking about market share and fail to realize that behind that the market has actually grown, and there's more wealth transfer going on and our goal is to maximize the value of this company for our shareholders.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Just one follow-up on this, like take for example, the fragmentation in the energy markets with a new entrant, is that somewhere \u2013 where you're not necessarily paying the rebate, but you are benefiting potentially because on exchange energy market data because you are still the significant player that has all the data. Is that a fair representation?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think as you go away and look at the numbers that we just put out, you're going to see that we beat on revenue and on earnings, largely because we have been able to monetize our historical data to new entrants that want to participate in those payment floor closed (34:25) schemes. What we have not done is actually go into that market and expand the market further again by paying more people for order flow. We've kept our basic core operation, and then decided to work with these new entrants. And we know who they are. We have sales people, there's constant conversation. There are people that approach us that want those payments. And so our strategy has been we can't stop what others do, but let's make sure that we participate and maximize our own footprint.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Got it, got it. And one quick follow-up, I think there's going to be a very short answer here. With Brexit, has it changed your view of the Deutsche Boerse-LSE merger? How do you think about that? At least the view we're getting is the probability of a deal has gone down directionally. I don't know what the actual numbers are, but directionally. Has that changed your view on potentially looking at that transaction?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That's a short question, but it's probably a long answer.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","I could pass it.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, no, I'll answer it. When we looked at that transaction and decided that we were not going to go forward, we were very open to say that we had some concerns that we didn't have enough information to put a credible bid on the table. What I didn't say at the time that I can say now is that at the time, we did not want to talk about Brexit, and we had been urged by others not to talk about Brexit.","But the way that deal was lining up, it was orchestrated so that we were going to, if we entered the deal, have to put a number on the table, right ahead of the Brexit vote. We happened to have at the time, three UK directors who sat on our board, who are incredibly knowledgeable people that are very engaged with us. And they were cautioning management and the rest of the board that the Brexit vote was going to be close, and they cautioned us back in February and March. And really said, you guys need to know exactly what you're doing and you need to run scenarios on what's going to happen in either eventuality.","So, we went out and we started talking to our UK colleagues to try to gauge where we thought the vote was going to come out. And honestly, we came to the opinion that the UK was probably going to leave. And so, we decided \u2013 given that we didn't have good information and given that we thought the landscape was going to change, that it was not an appropriate time for us to do a transaction.","And I think we were fortunate in making that decision. I don't know what the European landscape is going to be. We have been building our company to have a lot of options, and we've been very open about that. We've been very transparent that we, long ago, decided to build a footprint on the Continental Europe with an exchange and clearing house because we felt that there could be some fragmentation and balkanization that our customers would have demands. So, we're set up for change, but I don't know what the change is going to be. And, so it's hard, for anyone in any position in financial services to discuss what the outcome of Europe is going to look like.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Understood. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, guys. Scott, maybe just on the capital front, just given the pace that you've been moving on paying down debt and then the buyback authorization, just wanted to get maybe an update on where the target is that you want to get to, to be comfortable, particularly with rating agencies. And then just timing, particularly, when we're thinking about 2017 pursuing the buybacks versus obviously just other opportunities that you guys have been busy on in terms of acquisitions and investing in the business?","Scott A. Hill - Chief Financial Officer","Yes. Michael, I'll give you a shot at the answer, and if I miss anything, you just have to follow up. So, I said on the last call that our objective is to operate with leverage somewhere in the 1.75 times to 2.0 times range and that's still the case. We've had very open dialogue with the ratings agencies, and they've indicated a comfort level with our current rating in that range.","I don't think that means we have to necessarily be in that range to start the repurchases, but we certainly need to have a path to get to that range quickly as we introduce the repurchases. And so, in terms of timing, the other thing I'd say, there's always a number of variables. You asked about M&A in 2017. I have no idea what that could look like. We've got the S&P deal that we expect will close later this year. You've got the Cetip BM&F deal that is working its way through the process. So, there's any number of factors that could impact the timing and the size of the repurchases. I think what the authorization tells you is we are deleveraging at a faster rate than we anticipated. We had originally said we wouldn't be there until the end of next year. Now, we're saying possibly by the end of this year.","And so, look, I don't think it's out of the question that we're back in the market in the fourth quarter, but there'll be a number of variables that impact that. And, I wouldn't expect this to go from zero to 100 miles an hour in the first quarter that we start to buy back shares.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Makes sense. And then, just as a follow-up, just on the data business, you guys spend a decent amount of time on the exchange new data, I guess just looking at the pricing analytics and the desktop connectivity, you both mentioned some of the drivers of the overall 6% to 7% growth in terms of the retention of clients, the new clients signing up, some of the new products out there. I don't know if you have any stats, but just trying to get a sense on when you look at kind of the momentum that you're seeing in that business based on the growth rate that you put out for 2016, what's the longer term growth potential? And, again, mostly focus on the other two segments, just given that you gave a lot of color on the exchange side.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we've only owned the business, the Interactive Data business, for six months and we've only really been reorganized for a few weeks in terms of how our sales force is starting to take our combined product offering to market. But the early returns are really good. We see a lot of interest by large buy-side firms, for example, who want to have vendors that they can trust, who have a breadth of data, who meet their cyber security demands and give them sort of a single point to go to.","Right now, honestly, if you just step back and think about the world and your own behavior, the amount of data that we're all consuming just goes up. I mean, I have no doubt that the data plan that I have on my smartphone is going to consume more data in five years than it does today. And in every aspect of our lives and certainly here at ICE, the way we run our business, there is just more data available. And we have better and better tools to use that data and analyze that data.","When it comes to trading and risk management, there's no question that we're going to have more passive investment vehicles. Those are doing well and growing and growing quickly. There's no question that decisions are going to be made increasingly by algorithms or they're going to contribute to the decision-making process. And in my mind \u2013 and there's no question that regulators are going to demand \u2013 and, frankly, board of directors and the audit committee and auditors are going to demand better information faster than they've gotten it before.","And so, all those trends just suggest to us that there is an incredible future demand for information. And what we are trying to do is figure out areas where we really generate some unique proprietary content that will be of high value to our customers. And so, that's been our focus. And so far, the early returns have been really good. And frankly, on some of the sales meetings that I've been in, we've gotten a lot of positive feedback that it's nice to have a large-scale vendor of information to people that is very technology-focused and cyber security focused like we are to fit into their current demands for information.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. I guess, just following up on kind of the IDC outlook, just curious if there's been any implementation of price increases thus far and kind of the outlook for that in terms of your guidance for this year and maybe into next with regards to just the pricing side?","Scott A. Hill - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Dan, I'd go back to what Jeff said. We only own the business six or seven months. I think the success we're seeing right now is really, again, around the continued high retention of existing customers. Jeff's point about \u2013 as we talk to customers, their interest in having a data provider. And so, it's \u2013 the post that's showing up as SuperD or as ICE or as IDC, we're showing up as ICE Data Services. And I think we're seeing benefit from that in terms of securing new customers.","And again, as I said on the exchange data side, similarly, in the pricing and valuation side, I think it's customers who are purchasing more. It's beginning to gain traction in new products, continuous value of the pricing product that allows you during the day to get a view on the price of bonds that you may be interested in trading or that you hold in your portfolio, that's execution services.","So, it's really more, right now, new customers, retention of existing customers, building on new product development that actually started before we purchased IDC. I think to Jeff point, we've only really reorganized the sales team and the go-to-market in the past few weeks. So, I think that's why I'm confident about our ability to grow the rest of this year. And in the next year, as we do look at are we capturing the right value in our pricings, are there different ways we can package up across the various businesses that we've owned, are there better ways that we can deliver the information more efficiently across a single desktop versus multiple, et cetera. So, that's really the benefit I think that's in front of us, not that's reflected in the strong performance we've had in the first half.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","That's helpful. I guess, in response to most of these questions, the phrase new customers has come up a lot. I guess, can you give us some a little bit more context as to the segmentation of that or geography commercial versus financial, high frequency verse sell-side, buy-side? A little bit of context there would be helpful I think.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think one of the things that IDC has done for us is that it brought to us a dedicated sales force that had, to use an old term, a Rolodex, and really is very much centered on buy-side and as well as asset managers and intermediaries to asset managers. We're providing execution or regulatory services or custodial services. But that area was not an area that traditionally ICE had direct relationships with. And so, the reason that we're excited about some of the bundling and packaging and the reorganization of our sales force is that it opens a whole new customer base to us.","And what we have found, as I mentioned before, is that customer base who often times deals with lots of data vendors, appreciates having another large comprehensive offering so that it can be kind of a one-stop shop when it comes to purchasing and security issues.","Some of these things that we're providing are mission-critical services to companies that use them for regulatory purposes or reporting purposes, and so they need primaries, backups and others. They want as much information as they can. And having another large vendor enter the space has been very well received.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Kenneth Hill with Barclays.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Scott A. Hill - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about maybe the deal appetite in the data space. I mean, you've talked a little bit on this call about how you're reorganizing the sales team and the packaging, but are there still issues you're hearing from customers or maybe perceived gaps in your data offering where you think maybe an acquisition might fit nicely. I know you guys have been rumored out there with the Citi Yield Book and then also had done something with Mortgage Electronic Registration System? So, just wanted to get your broader thoughts there?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think if you step back and look at what is ICE's position in the market, we're not a reseller of other people's data. We're really \u2013 people are creating proprietary content. And so, areas that are of interest to us is where are things, where there is some content that we could help monetize through our channel. That being said, as you probably know, we operate here and in M&As -we buy versus build on every decision we make as a buy versus build decision. And many of the valuations in the data space are quite high and they certainly wouldn't operate on our return on invested capital thresholds that we operate under. So, it's not as easy as saying, yeah, we're just going to go hoover up everything that's out there because there are some great companies but they are fully valued by the market right now.","So, we have to be somewhat creative. I'll just quickly mention MERS. I got \u2013 years and years ago, many people on this call would ask us what is our strategy in the interest rate space. And, we knew that there were some dominant and important people in that space, and it would be hard to compete. And so we started breaking down the interest rate market and trying to think of where are the opportunities that we could enter the market and we started to focus on the mortgage space and this was before the financial crisis. And a very gracious gentleman, Bill Krueger (50:15), who was a banker at JPMorgan said, well, I can introduce you to the people at MERS. MERS is an industry consortium of 5,000 members in the mortgage community including everybody that matters in the mortgage community. And we started to talk to MERS prior to the financial crisis about whether or not there would be an opportunity to privatize it.","The financial crisis intervened. MERS was involved in effectively robo-signing mortgages on behalf of lenders and got very embroiled and was put into conservatorship along with Fannie and Freddie. It has now made its way through that and it's ready to have continued investment. A new look \u2013 a new outlook and we were able to convince the members that that consortium should privatize with ICE and that we will help bring them together.","About five years ago, we never announced, but we did buy a mortgage platform and a team in Silicon Valley that was working on some advanced techniques around mortgages. We've continued to quietly build that out and obviously worked with MERS over the last few years on how we could put these systems together and are thrilled to announce that we're going to work with the MERS team, that Fannie and Freddie and some of the bank interests are going to stay on the board of the company to help us. And that we think there's a really interesting opportunity to bring some evolution to the broad market for residential mortgages in the United States.","Small deal in terms of how it exists today, but it could have large repercussions if we all get together and work on this successfully. So, it's great to see a long, long cycle actually close. And they feel it's been a long, long cycle as well.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Appreciate the background there. Just wanted to change topics and talk a little bit globally. I mean, we've talked a lot about Europe and you guys also have a presence in Asia. I'm wondering if you can give update on Singapore Merc and may be how that's progressing? And if the outlook shifted there at all given what's going on in Europe from a customer perspective?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's interesting. So, the footprint that we have in Asia, what we're really trying to do out of that operation is to attract a customer that we would not have seen before. We benefited, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, from being in London, in that many Asian interests were happy to come meet us in London and do business in London. And I really do believe based on conversations we've had with the UK government that the government has incredibly strong interest in adopting policies that will continue to attract Asian business to come to London.","But that being said, there are a lot of smaller players, niche players that existed in the region that were not going to come to London. And the real key that we've had in Singapore is getting to those new customers, getting them to join the exchange, getting them to set up in the clearing house. These are brokers, these are commodity merchants and others across the broad region of Asia, and we've had good success there.","And really, if you look at our focus, it's not on day-to-day volume. It's on chipping away at a targeted customer list and getting them through the process that the MAS, the regulator in Singapore, requires to be passported into a Singapore exchange and clearing house. And that work is ongoing and it's going well, and every day \u2013 it is a network effect. So every day that somebody new joins or takes interest, it spills over to the next person. And so, we feel like we're making very good progress there.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Question around the fixed income ETF business, it seems like it's been a pretty robust growth in the market space this year. And I think we would argue there's a lot of secular opportunities for that market space to grow further. Can you talk to us a little bit about the opportunity for ICE to monetize this trend? It seems like you could really come on a couple of \u2013 across a couple of different areas on the listing side, trading side, and maybe the data side. So, help us understand, I guess, how meaningful a trend that could be for you, guys? And then, secondly, maybe we can hit on the competitive landscape for ETF listings as well?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Well, first of all, when we talk to sponsors of ETFs in that community, they are incredibly bullish on the demand for fixed income ETFs. It is a real growth area. And so, there's tremendous interest by sponsors in that arena to talk to us about what we can do.","We have a unique ability in that we had an ETP listings team of very good and well-known ETP listings team at the NYSE, which we were able to combine with our index and data people and put together essentially packages that we can take to these ETP providers where we can develop an index or replace an index. We can provide the data. We have the systems internally to do real-time calculation and NAV calculations. We can list it. We can help them market it. We can use the ICE brand. We can use the NYSE brand. So, we bring a lot of assets to the table with these providers, and we're aggressive and we're interested in this space. And so, we're able to move quickly. So, I think it's going to be a growth area for us.","In terms of how it's monetized, we don't really care in a package whether it's monetizing the data or monetizing the index or monetizing the infrastructure. All of that can go together in a cauldron that can be very value-enhancing for these ETP providers.","There's no question that it is a competitive space, and that people there are interested in speed-to-market and they're interested in low administrative costs. And so, once we get those ETPs up, then we continue to market the fact that we have continuous evaluated pricing, that we have these liquidity indicators that \u2013 and honestly, we \u2013 then we go to the active fund managers and talk to them about how are they going to respond to this passive trend and what can we do for them.","So, it's a really unique moment in time, and we're kind of hitting a sweet spot in the space in our mind with an opportunity set and capabilities set that we have. So \u2013 I'm sorry, what was the second...?","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","...second part of your question was...","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Well...","Scott A. Hill - Chief Financial Officer","I think the second part was really around the competitive environment. I think the point there is, if you look at assets under management in that space, we've got 92% that are listed at the New York Stock Exchange. And so, as Jeff alluded to, we've got the experience, we've got a highly qualified team and we've got a history of being the place where ETPs come to list.","And so, from a competitive standpoint, it's a good place to build from. We certainly don't take it for granted, and that's why, as Jeff said, we're constantly developing additional capabilities to bring to customers. But we like the competitive position we have today. It's a good starting point and a good place to build from.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. None of what I just suggested there that we can offer those ETP provider says, hey, we're going to pay for order flow or some other economic deal. This is really about how can we partner and create value together with each other. We \u2013 NYSE Arca is where 92% of the AUM exists. That is a single exchange. It has very deep liquidity on a single exchange. We have other competitors that like to add together three or four exchanges and then show a number, but the ETP sponsors don't really care about the volume across a bunch of fragmented markets. They want to know is there depth of liquidity in the market where this thing is primarily going to trade. That is a real competitive advantage that we have. And then, when we couple that with all the other services that we can provide that are value-added, we've seen that we continue to do very well.","I would mention there's something like four new ETP listings per day. So, the vast majority, unfortunately, like any new business, are probably not going to grow very big or amount to much. They become highly differentiated and specialized, in many cases. But this broad area that you started your questioning of bond ETF is one where there is tremendous demand, it seems, by wealth managers and investors who see the convenience of not having to deal with individual bond securities (01:00:05).","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks. Thanks for the detailed answer.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. And the next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning.","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Alex.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","I guess, for Scott. You talked about the synergies obviously in 2016 and nice update there. Can you give us some early thoughts, how that, what you said today, impact 2017 and 2018? Is this just a pull forward? Do you think maybe you get everything done in 2017 and nothing bleeds to 2018 or do you actually feel confident that you could actually upsize synergies down the line after what you've seen or done so far this year?","Scott A. Hill - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Look, Alex, I think what you're seeing as we go through this year is that, as opposed to the NYSE, where we announced that deal in 2012 and then had a year before it closed and a year to work on the integration plans and the synergies and so, when we came out with a number on that at close, we were like this is the number. And we subsequently executed on it really well.","The IDC deal was a completely different deal. It was an auction. It closed the day we signed it, and that's really when the integration work began in earnest. And, so, we're continuing to dig through, and we are seeing early success and greater success than we had counted on in things like corporate integration, where we've been able to identify and eliminate corporate redundancies faster.","We're seeing things like 7ticks network and the safety network, where we knew there might be some overlap, come together and we're realizing benefits from that sooner. And, so, that's really the acceleration of the $25 million to $50 million in this year. I don't think our view on the overall synergies related to that business really have changed. The timing hasn't changed. There is a heavy piece of technology integration that has to occur. And, as you know, with the NYSE acquisition, that's kind of the last chunk of synergies that we're going to realize there. I suspect that will be the case at IDC as well. We will certainly get the synergies, the timing of them. I'll give you an update on 2017 as we move later into this year and I'll give you an update on 2018 as we move into the later of 2017. But, we said at the beginning of the year, $220 million to go. We've now got a $100 million of that that will get done this year. I'm very confident over the course of 2017 and 2018 and maybe a little bit into early 2019, that we will get that last $120 million out of what's roughly now a $2 billion expense base.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","All right, very good. And, then, just secondly, coming back to the data side, just for a minute here, I think one of the things you don't talk about a lot is that you actually have a pretty big desktop presence now. I believe, like you have WebICE in the past, and I think IDC got you I think two different desktop brands and, obviously, trade for it. (63:04) So, any bigger plans for that? How should we think about \u2013 I mean, you talk about proprietary data really being your focus, but now you've got a lot of desktop space. So, can you lever that into anything more interesting or is it just a side business for you?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","When we started the company, Chuck Vice and I designed version 1.0 of what we call WebICE, which was a screen that you could log on to via the Internet. And that screen still exists today in versions that go way beyond my expertise, for sure, and has been an important part of our ecosystem.","Really, for us, the focus is talking to an end user customer, saying how do you want to consume the services that we provide? We can give you an API if you want to build your own infrastructure, or we can give you certain tools that we can put on your desktop or on your phone. And because we really have upped our game after acquiring the New York Stock Exchange, when it comes to cyber security and thoughtfulness about connectivity, we're very, very good counterparty to many financial institutions that care deeply about these things. So, it is a means to an end in our mind. But we are bringing all of that together, again, as part of the sales reorganization, and the way we're going to offer and package things. And we think every day becomes a more and more powerful offering, and that's how we think about it.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Chris Allen with Buckingham. Please go ahead, Buckingham. You are live. All right. Very good. Then the next question comes from Vincent Hung with Autonomous.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Hi. So, when we think about the tailwind in data from the shift independent pricing sources and regulatory requirements, how much more runway is there here?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean, it's hard to have a crystal ball to predict the future, but I will tell you that in markets that we see that become fragmentated, the data becomes the currency. Data is king. Information is king in fragmented markets. And we think that there's just no choice but for markets that used to be pretty global and contained to become more fragmentated due to algorithmic trading, payment for order flow, new competitors that are building digital systems and the fact that there's going to be more local regulations.","So, we think that on the same time that those markets are changing and evolving, the customers are getting more sophisticated about the ability to consume data and make decisions on risk management going forward. So, I just think it's a long-term trend and I think \u2013 I've said before, I think the data package that you have on your mobile phone will be bigger in five years than it is today and the same for me and everybody that's listening. I just think that it is the unique opportunity of our times to really be connected and have vast amounts of information at your fingertips.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Yeah. And just lastly, do you have any insight into the sales cycle in the IDC north of (01:07:04) the exchange data businesses?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, interesting. So, we have a high renewal rate. So, there's a vast audience of people that have agreements that have expiration dates and we have a team that goes in well before that. And those renewals happen as you can see a very high rate of renewal. And that sale cycle is an obvious one that is driven by the contracts.","But for new acquisitions, we've seen some of the, as I've mentioned, some of the aggressive market participants particularly people that are doing exchange traded products and new innovative things want to have speed to market. So, those sale cycles have tended to be short.","We're also seeing, I think some longer sale cycles where we're in conversations with people about wholesale changes to the way we deliver and the technology that underlies our data and the way we deliver it and the way the two of us would technologically connect and work together. Those are probably multiyear cycles because we both are committing to build kind of new infrastructure that will better scale for future demand.","And then, there's everything in between. We are pleasantly surprised, I would tell you that we predicted that we could grow this business quickly and we have definitely done that. So, there is a part of the sales cycle that is moving very, very quickly to the point that you can see it in the increased growth of the businesses that we own. And so, that's the good news. But there is \u2013 we will tell you, there is a back end to it based on some of these other trends that we think will pay dividends into the future.","When Scott is guiding that already can tell you what the fourth quarter number is going to be, it gives you some indication that we have visibility into the next few quarters that is pretty accurate.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. So at this time, I would like to return the call to Jeffrey Sprecher for any closing comments?","Jeffrey Craig Sprecher - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thank you, Keith, our operator, and I want to thank all of you who joined us today.

These measures adjust our GAAP results for various extraordinary items, including our acquisition of NYSE Euronext, and we believe they are more reflective of our business performance than our GAAP results. You will find a non-GAAP reconciliation in the earnings release and presentation, and the explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful, as well as how management uses these measures.","The materials presented today reflects futures volumes that has been restated to include previously cleared swap contract partners. In addition, net revenue, referred to revenue, net of transaction based expenses. With us on the call are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Chuck Vice, President and Chief Operating Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Scott.","Scott A. Hill","Thank you, Kelly. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. I will begin on Slide 4, where you can see that 2013 marked our eighth consecutive record year, extending our track record of growth each year since becoming a public company. Our net revenues and earnings grew to double-digit rates, and we completed strategic acquisitions that should support our ability to continue to generate growth and solid return.","This performance was driven by growth across our global commodity complex, including strong volume and open interest trends. We closed on the NYSE Euronext acquisition in November, and have already made significant progress on integration. We also expanded our natural gas business with the launch of ICE Index in March, and we extended our reach in Asia with the acquisition of the Singapore Mercantile Exchange and Clearing Corporation, which closed last week. Our 2014 objectives are focused on extending our track record of growth. We will continue to focus on serving our customers and generating value for our shareholders through execution of our strategic initiatives and our integration plan.","Please turn to Slide 5, where I will detail our fourth quarter results. I want to start by noting a few special expense items that resulted in a quarterly loss on a GAAP basis in the fourth quarter. First, we recorded a foreign currency driven impairment of $190 million related to our Cetip investment. This was primarily due to the 33% depreciation of the Brazilian reis, since we acquired our 12% stake in 2011.","It is important to note that this impairment reflects a devaluation of the reis, not a revaluation of our Cetip investment. We continue to expand our partnership with Cetip, and believe that the investment will be a source of value generation in the future. We also had a $51 million expense related to the early repayment of our $400 million in private notes. And finally, tax affecting these special items and including some foreign tax law changes, we had a net tax impact of $4 million.","However, excluding those atypical items, our fourth-quarter adjusted operating results marked a strong finish to a record year. Net revenues totaled $612 million for the quarter, driven by solid performance across energy, ag, and financial. Adjusted operating expenses were $318 million, and our adjusted operating margin was 48%. In a moment, I will walk you through our roadmap to draw margins back to more traditional levels.","Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 27%, in line with guidance. Adjusted net income attributable to ICE was $192 million, and adjusted earnings per share grew 9% versus the prior year to $2.00 per share, and finally for the year, operating cash flows were $735 million, and capital expenditures and capitalized software, including real estate were $110 million.","Let us move to Slide 6, where you can clearly see the track record of growth I mentioned previously. On a compounded annual basis over the last four years, revenues have grown 14% and net income has grown 20%. In 2013, net revenue was $1.7 billion, an increase of 23%, and adjusted net income grew 16% to $646 million. Adjusted earnings per share were $8.17, up 8% year-to-year. Volume growth, which for EBIT comparison, includes all prior period NYSE Euronext volume, was driven by strength across our commodity futures contract despite a muted year in the natural gas market.","We achieved records in BRIX, heating oil, RBOB, sugar, coffee, cocoa, canola and US dollar index futures. Average daily volumes in 2013 grew 6% over the prior year. On the expense side in 2013, total adjusted operating expenses were $715 million. Our disciplined focus on balancing expenses with growth resulted in ICE\u2019s standalone expenses growing by less than 2%, which generated roughly 5% earnings growth on a stand-alone basis.","Now let us turn to Slide 7, where I will discuss our 2013 pro forma revenue diversification. On the left, you can see our pro forma net revenue by business lines for 2013. On the right side, you can see a view of revenue, excluding Euronext and certain NYSE technology businesses that we plan to divest.","Note that our derivatives business expands from 44% to 50% of net revenues, including 32% in commodities, 13% in financial products, and 5% in equity derivatives. Commodities include energy, ag, and metal futures. Financial products include interest rate, equity index and currency futures, with interest rates comprising nearly 70% of that mix. Equity derivatives include our two US options exchanges, and UK single stock futures. Post Euronext, cash trading will represent only 6% of revenues on a pro forma basis.","Moving forward to Slide 8 I will discuss our derivatives revenue. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $287 million, up 24% year-to-year. BRIX revenues expanded to $50 million and North American nat gas revenues were $44 million. Ag and interest rate revenues were $38 million and $29 million respectively, including seven weeks of contribution from Liffe. Our fourth-quarter revenue mix is reflected on the left side of this chart.","Average daily volumes in the quarter were 9.1 million contracts, an increase of 2% year-to-year. We saw strength in our oil complex, with daily futures volumes up 8%. This included ICE brent futures volumes up 9% and other oil volume up 22%. In our natural gas market, in contrast with most of the year, we saw strength in volumes towards the end of 2013, and continuing into the first weeks of 2014, driven mostly by cold weather, which increased price volatility.","In our Ag futures market, daily volume increased 12% year-to-year due to shifts in inventory and growing conditions particularly related to sugar. Daily volume in financial products increased 14% from the prior fourth quarter, with interest rate futures up 15%. Short-term interest rate volume was up nearly 20% year-to-year. Revenue capture is measured by rate per contract, or RPC, remained steady across Ags, financials, and Equity derivatives.","Energy RPC was impacted by product mix shifting towards gas and power at the end of the year. As of December 31, 2013, total open interest was $116 million with BRIX, other oil and Ag futures each up at least 10% from the prior year and a number of products at record levels. And as we announced last week, we saw continued strength in natural gas and Ags in January, with growth of 9% and 7% respectively versus January 2013.","In addition, as a result of greater volatility in the equity market, equity index futures average daily volume increased 20% over the same period. However, total futures daily volumes declined 8% versus the prior year, driven by lower volumes across our interest rate futures complex in January 2014. The strength in volumes at January 2013 was due to the start of repayment under the long-term refinancing operation or LTROs in Europe, and changes in expectations for future interest rate levels.","Please flip to Slide 9, where I will provide an overview of our interest rate futures. When we made the decision to acquire NYSE Euronext, we stated our belief that 2012 represented cyclically depressed volume levels. At the time, volume averaged 2.3 million contracts per day, the lowest level since 2006. During 2013, we saw record interest-rate volume driven by change in expectations and [Indiscernible] actions, which resulted in daily volumes up 25% over 2012.","Our flagship, Euribor futures daily volume grew 32% in 2013 over 2012 level, with Sterling daily volume up 25%, and gilt futures up 12%. This January, Euribor volume declined versus January 2013 level, but was up 9% versus December. Trading activity in our sterling market also grew during 2013, and into the first quarter of 2014, with volumes above 1 million contracts per day in January.","Fourth quarter CDS revenues were $34 million. This included $14 million from trade execution, and $19 million from clearing. For the year, we achieved record revenues for global CDS clearing of $80 million. Through January, we have cleared $48 trillion in gross notional value, which includes over $4 trillion in client clearings. We continue to develop new cleared products in our SEF platform to support the CDS market, which is developing stable revenues and profit contribution amid a time of continued uncertainty.","Moving next to Slide 11, I will provide an update on our $500 million target for expense synergies related to the NYSE Euronext transaction. As a reminder, the baseline expense number is roughly $2.14 billion. This means that excluding Euronext expenses of over $300 million, which are not included in our synergy forecast, we reduced combined expenses by nearly 30%. We are in full execution mode with regards to our detailed integration plan and remain confident that we can achieve at least 70% of our synergies on a run rate basis exiting 2014, and 90% exiting 2015.","As you see on the chart, we already improved from $95 million to $108 million of realized synergies during the fourth quarter. In addition, our first-quarter 2014 expense guidance of $470 million to $480 million reflects run rate savings of over $220 million, or slightly more than double where we ended the year.","Let us next cover Slide 12, where you can see that we generated solid cash and returns again in 2013. Operating cash flows were $735 million. We had just under $1 billion in unrestricted cash and cash equivalent at December 31, including amounts successfully paid out to close our Singapore transaction, and to fund our contribution to the ICE Clear US Guaranty Fund. And we ended the year with roughly $5 billion in total debt and an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio below 2.5 times.","In terms of capital allocation, we are committed to delevering to get to our debt to EBITDA target of 1.5 times by the back half of 2015. Also we made our first quarterly dividend payment of $0.65 in December, and this morning we announced that we would again pay a quarterly dividend of $0.65 per share in March. Given the solid cash flow we expect to generate in our strategic divestitures, we expect to be able to continue to pursue growth opportunities and execute share repurchases in a manner that will not jeopardize our investment grade rating.","We remain intensely focused on delivering shareholder value and take the role as stewards of shareholder capital very seriously. For 2013, our ROIC of 9% remained above our cost of capital and that of our competitors. We will update this important indicator of value creation as a key measure of our 2014 financial performance.","Let us turn to Slide 13, and review our current guidance for the first quarter of 2014 and for the full year. For the first quarter of 2014, as mentioned previously, we expect adjusted operating expenses, excluding NYSE technology, to come in between $470 million and $480 million. We also expect to achieve 70% of our synergies by the time we exit 2014. It is important to also note though that we will continue to invest in our business.","We expect to spend an incremental $40 million to $50 million in 2014, with roughly half related to our normal salary increase program, and restoring our bonus accrual to 100%, and the other half targeted in investment in technology enhancement across our exchanges and clearing houses, in addition to key growth initiatives such as ICE benchmark administration, SMX, and Cetip.","We believe these investments can support incremental revenues of $100 million to $140 million in 2014. As has always been the case if we don\u2019t see the revenue materialize, our pay for performance culture and disciplined approach to hiring will quickly self correct. For interest expense, we expect roughly $29 million in the first quarter, dropping to $26 million, $27 million per quarter, as we further optimize our bank facility.","D&A expenses for 2014 is expected to be between $320 million and $350 million, including $75 million to $80 million in the first quarter. Finally, we expect an effective tax rate of 27% to 30% for 2014, and expect capital expenditures in capitalized software of $180 million to $200 million, excluding real estate expenditures. While we have good visibility into the first quarter expenses, the timing of synergy realization and related investments during the year make it difficult to provide a precise full-year expense number at this point in time.","However, as always, we remain very transparent and timely in providing additional guidance as the year progresses. Finally, please note that beginning in the first quarter, we expect to begin reporting into segments, an ICE segment and a Euronext segment, and as noted previously, we will report the to be divested NYSE technology businesses in discontinued operations to provide visibility into the performance of our core business.","I will wrap up on Slide 15. We believe we have a roadmap to expand margins by executing on our synergy plan even as we invest in continuing to grow the top line. We believe this margin progress will be a key measure of our success as it can enable us to deliver double-digit earnings growth over the long term.","When we announced the NYSE Euronext deal, our pro forma consolidated margin was 42%. Less than one year later, and after realizing $95 million in synergies, our operating margin was 45%. We expect that the IPO of Euronext and divestiture of certain NYSE technology businesses will enable margins to reach 48% to 49% during this year. At a 70% expense synergy run rate we expect our margins to be approximately 54% to 55% entering 2015.","As we continue to realize our synergies during 2015, margins should expand further to approximately 57% to 58%, and finally, at full synergy achievement of $500 million by 2016, we believe our operating margin can return to 60%. We are focused on creating a lean, efficient and growth oriented business, and we have a strategic and financial roadmap to do just that.","And with that I will turn it over to Jeff.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Thank you Scott, and good morning to everybody on today\u2019s call. I will begin on slide 16 with a recap of our objectives and results, as well as our outlook for 2014. While delivering our eight consecutive record year, we completed two acquisitions in 2013 and announced the third.","I want to thank our team for their focus on serving our customers, while working to complete many strategic initiatives. These include the transition of Liffe interest rate and other futures contracts to ICE Clear Europe, and our expansion into interest rates and new financial and agricultural products. This was successfully completed in six months time, and it speaks to the quality of the clearing systems we have invested in, together with our dedicated staff, and the relationships with clearing members, who supported our transition.","Just prior to that, we completed our acquisition of a majority stake in ICEEndex giving us our first exchange on Continental Europe, and expanding our reach in the European energy markets for natural gas and power. In the fourth quarter, we completed the migration of trading and clearing for all ICEEndex derivatives contracts, to the ICE trading and clearing platform.","In January 2014, we are pleased to report that Endex\u2019s volume reached record levels for the month. In 2013, we also announced the agreement to acquire the Singapore Mercantile Exchange and the Clearing Corporation, which was completed last week, and I\u2019m going to come back to that transaction in a moment. We also grew our underlying business despite the headwinds of low natural gas volatility and continued change and uncertainty around financial reform.","In our brent crude contract, we reported our 17 consecutive record year for contract volume, and this was in spite of a significant change to the contract as we worked with the industry to transition to a new expiry calendar. This was the first such change in brent\u2019s 25 year history, and it better aligns the futures to the new physical market calendar, which has been going through its own series of changes. Also in 2013, brent expanded its leadership in market share, and saw a record open interest. ","Turning to interest rates, Liffe reported strong double-digit growth in its interest rate futures complex. These include the four year Euribor mid curve option, which was introduced at the end of 2012, and which reached 962,000 contracts per day by the end of 2013. Our swap note contracts ended 2013 with December volumes being the strongest throughout the year, and activity in 2014 has continued that trend.","Based on the demand for new products, we will be developing our swap futures franchise with additional products and programs. We launched our European trade repository, ICE Trade Vault Europe, which now collects futures and OTC trade facility for energy and credit markets.","We also continued our strong commitment to product development and expansion of our clearing services, with roughly 150 new energy contracts launched and nearly 180 credit default swaps instruments cleared. In the fourth quarter, we introduce buy-side clearing at ICE Clear Europe, well in advance of the European regulatory requirements, and the anticipated rising demand for capital efficiency.","Today, we have more than 300 buy-side firms actively clearing on ICE. All of this contributed to our record revenues for credit default swap clearing. And more recently, we were the first to offer a multi-dealer and client central limit order book trading platform for single names as we continued to participate in the evolution of the credit default swap market.","Within a week of completing the acquisition of NYSE Euronext in November, we detailed our extensive integration and strategic plans. And today we are well into executing on those plans with significant progress just 2.5 months post-close. Importantly, we are now serving markets in nine asset classes across four continents, up from only one asset class on two continents just seven years ago.","Going public on the New York stock exchange in 2005 was certainly a pivotal moment for us. And on slide 17, I\u2019m pleased to note NYSE\u2019s continued leadership in global listings in its third consecutive record year for IPOs and capital raising. This included a second consecutive record year in technology IPOs, facilitating 30 tech IPOs, and our momentum has continued into this year in January as we welcome 10 IPOs, compared with just six the prior January.","The NYSE\u2019s hybrid market model has engendered confidence as a result of its continuity and performance, and we continue to build on that through innovation to support the capital raising activities for companies around the world. We have strong momentum in our listings business, and we will continue to bring value to our unique visibility and market model, and we will continue to take part in the industry dialogue on ensuring that investors and issuers have confidence in our global equity markets.","Turning to 2014 on Slide 18, we are advancing a number of strategic objectives to leverage our network of exchanges and clearing houses around the world. We have discussed many of these here today, and laid out our road map on our November 19 call. Today as the only exchange globally with operations in the US, Canada, Asia, Europe and Brazil, we have a tremendous amount of flexibility and opportunity to pursue growth.","We were pleased to complete our acquisition of the Singapore Mercantile Exchange and Clearing Corporation last week. This transaction was completed with a vision for creating a truly global marketplace, where we are serving our customers in their time zone and in the jurisdictions in which they do business.","ICE has had operations in Singapore for over a decade as a result of our oil business, and we have seen first hand the importance of building relationships in the region. Given our existing product sets in commodities and financial markets and the demand for risk management tools, which is growing in Asia, the opportunity to build out these markets is a very compelling one. And we look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming months.","Another major track that is under way is the transitioning of the Liffe products to the ICE futures exchanges and clearing houses over the course of 2014. The transition will entail continuing to move these products to the ICE technology platform. There are a number of new products that we\u2019re focused on ranging from the ultra long gilt to building on our successful DTCC GCF Repo product, which is currently listed as Liffe US. ","I want to pause here and thank the Liffe customers for supporting us during the clearing transition. We have been intensely focused on rapidly integrating our clearing business, and will soon begin integrating our trading markets. We plan to introduce our ultra long gilt futures contract by the end of this quarter, and we are examining other new financial product ideas to support our customers in their risk management and capital efficiency requirements.","Last week, following the approval from the FCA, ICE Benchmark Administration formally launched taking over the administration of the LIBOR Benchmark. ICE Benchmark Administration has worked closely with the British Bankers Association, the industry and stakeholders to ensure no disruption to the calculation and publication of the LIBOR rate. ICE Benchmark Administration will operate with a robust oversight and governance framework, including an independent board with a majority of non-executive directors.","An oversight committee will administer the LIBOR code of conduct, and to expand on this capability, we will look to develop international initiatives around our benchmark operations. Turning to our integration work on slide 19, we are working to diligently unlock value from our acquisition of NYSE Euronext. We are separating the Liffe and the Euronext operations as a preceding to the eventual IPO of Euronext this year.","We made good progress and we are working with regulators to ensure that we organize the operations in a way that creates a viable, strong, independent Euronext. We have announced our European management team with Dominique Cerutti as chief executive, together with a team of experienced managers. We will have more information on the timing in the next couple of months subject to our continued progress with regulatory approvals.","Completion of the IPO is expected in the second quarter subject to these approvals, and to capital market conditions. On slide 20, I would like to note that in the US, 2013 proved to be a year of implementation. While the G 20 commitments for mandatory trading and clearing are consistent with the exchange model, we are seeing some issues with the harmonization of global financial reform for those relying on exchanges and clearing house for risk management.","The lack of harmonization is leading to more silhouette operations within our global customer base, where participants wrestle with rules that limit transacting with international counterparts. Our global exchange model is very well positioned to adapt to shift in customer preference as they evaluate their risks and opportunities across regulatory jurisdictions.","Last month, the European commission agreed on final concepts for MiFID II, and while it has not been published, it includes open access provisions, access to certain benchmarks, and increased acquisition of position limits. The specifics have not been defined under the rule-making process, but over the next year, lawmakers will draft the level 2 text. We believe that implementation will take from 3 to 5 years.","ICE has been a leader in creating competition, and we\u2019re also strong advocates for secure and transparent markets. We are entering the sixth year of the position limit debate in the United States. This was a process that started in 2008 with our OTC energy markets, and today we have position limits on most of our energy contracts following their conversion to futures in 2012.","While our business depends on the health of economies and the health of our customers, which range from leading global commodity producers two financial institutions, to active traders, our focus has been on change, and how economic and regulatory environments are impacting our customers. We have introduced new products and built new businesses to help them adapt.","The initiatives we pursued involve significant complexity and investment. They represent our strategy to build for the future, our markets are increasingly relied upon by regulators and customers for their compliance activity and for managing risk.","I will close on Slide 21, and note that the rate of change and reworking of global markets is really unprecedented. The stress that uncertainty has put on markets has been evident over the last couple of years. That being said, we are in the business of managing risk, and there is a growing demand for just that. Therefore we have many avenues for growth.","Our strategy for diversifying across asset classes, geographies and revenue stream ensures that we will have the flexibility to lead, where our customers need us to go. In 2014, we are focused on executing our double-digit growth objective, building on our leadership in the global commodity markets, expanding our footprint in interest rates and financial derivative clearing, and on growing our footprint in Asia and abroad.","We are working quickly to evolve and integrate to ensure that we are lean, cost efficient, customer oriented, and anticipating our customer\u2019s needs. ","So on behalf of everyone at ICE I would like to thank our customers for trusting us with their business in 2013. We look forward to speaking with you in the coming weeks as we continue to move our business forward.","I now like to ask our operator Emily to conduct a question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator instructions) And our first question comes from Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Richard Repetto \u2013 Sandler O'Neill","","Yes, good morning Jeff, good morning Scott. I guess my question is on MiFID II and you did address it in the prepared remarks Jeff, but if it, you know, it seems like they are moving, you know, over an extended period and again the rules are still unclear, but towards open access, but they stopped short of interoperability of the clearing houses. And could you just say, you know, did you expect this and how you are positioned if, you know, again it is a 3 to 5 -- I agree with the 3 to 5 years as an extended period away, but how you are thinking about your business and how will you transition your business if those are the rules of the road going forward in Europe?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","","Well, thank you Rich. The first thing is as you are aware I believe that MiFID II together with the [new] legislation is part of a very broad package of regulatory change that was agreed to at the G-20, and it is an attempt to harmonize broadly with what we have done here in the US with Dodd-Frank and then other securities regulation and obviously to harmonize with other countries around the world.","So it is a pretty broad package. The trend in clearing also broadly has been for more access. The most recent clearing houses that we built have been very open access in credit default swap clearings, and I think part of the regulatory compact that regulators and legislators are looking at is as more business is being encouraged to go into clearing through regulation, and the people want to make sure that there is access to clearing and broadly that is a trend that existed even before regulation and one that we support.","We have received insurances from very high levels in the European governmental debate, that there is no interest in imparting additional risk into the system by in linking clearing houses in the same way that we are trying to unlink -- the banks were linked and the whole movement towards clearing has been to more isolate and identify risk and not to [re-link] it.","So we have been encouraged and have had a lot of conversation both leading up to the MiFID II and post- MiFID II on how, you know, risk can be managed. You know, I mentioned also in our prepared remarks we have a lot of flexibility to follow our customers where they go, and one of the things that we are seeing is that, you know, for a long time, Europe, particularly the UK enjoyed business that was being done globally, where they could access the east and west time zone, and have the Queen\u2019s [Wall], which people appreciated.","But regulation is increasingly because it is not yet harmonized identically, it is increasingly balkanizing jurisdictions and we are watching our customers react to that. And partly our strategy here has been to make sure that we are in the places where our customers may move business. So, at the margin there is a lot of unknown about where the next level of investment will be on behalf of our customers in terms of doing their global business. Will they continue to sit in one place and operate east to west, or will they actually put assets in each jurisdiction where they have to manage risk.","And I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to know that immediately, but obviously ICE positioned itself exactly for this eventuality and it was one of the reasons that months and months ago, I reached out to the owners of the Singapore Mercantile Exchange, and tried to engage them on the idea that we would either work together or actually acquire the business to make sure that we had additional assets in Asia.","The last thing I would mention is that in MiFID II, one of the things that you have seen that they have tried to tackle is the preventing of fragmentation of markets, and the Europeans are very [Indiscernible] to the problems of fragmentation, the benefits of competition can be lost in the cost of fragmentation. And that is acknowledged in MiFID II. So as more access is brought in to clearing and trading, we do believe that there is this overarching knowledge that it should not be something that fragments market to the point that the only way one can participate is through algorithmic trading, which is a natural outcome of people trying to reassemble the market themselves, as opposed to allowing them to naturally come together in networks. And so, I do take some encouragement from the balance that Europe is trying to strike.","Richard Repetto \u2013 Sandler O'Neill","Okay. That is very helpful. Thanks. I will get back in the queue.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher ","","Great. Thank you Rich.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Christopher Harris \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Thanks. Hi guys.","Scott A. Hill","Hi.","Christopher Harris \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","My one question is on Liffe. You know, we know about the cyclical uplift potential there, and 2013 was clearly a great year. Just curious to get your perspective on how you view the organic growth opportunity at Liffe evolving over the next couple of years, I know there has been some new products introduced, but I think you can maybe kind of guide us to the upside potential there would be helpful?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Yes, well, you know, honestly we have got \u2013 I think there is two levers, and one lever we can control and one we can't. The one that we can control is to continue to roll out new products and services around the existing Liffe business, which we are in a great position to do and have already done since immediately acquiring the business because we do control both the technology and the clearing infrastructure, and that gives us the ability to really focus on customer needs and the risk that they are holding and try to create things that will help them manage that risk.","And I do think there is a lot of opportunity there. The whole financial space broadly has had a large over the counter component to it that increasingly is coming towards organized trading and transparency and clearing. So those are the issues that we spend a lot of time talking about and working on internally and spending a lot of time with the customer.","The other lever is really one that we wanted to position ourselves for which is a recovery or a rise let us say in European interest rates. The liquidity that\u2019s been put into the system over the last few years in order to stabilize the system in the United States has started to taper and eventually we think some more things will happen in Europe as they are lagging a bit behind us. And I think that will create volatility, natural volatility, in the market that will cause people to want to manage risk and lock-in in these historically low rates. And so while we don\u2019t control the timing of that, it's certainly has been on my mind to position the company for what we think is probably a natural eventuality. ","Christopher Harris \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities ","Thanks Jeff.","","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Worthington of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","","Kenneth Worthington \u2013 JP Morgan","","Hi, good morning.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Good morning.","Kenneth Worthington \u2013 JP Morgan ","With regard to natural gas, ICE had launched, you know, 800 plus products over the last few years. Many of those I think were in natural gas. Given what's happening in the gas markets, and particularly the gas \u2013 the Henry versus the shale markets, are some of these or many of these new products actually getting to a level of critical mass, which maybe sustainable even after prices fall or if they are not getting the critical mass, how long do you think you will need to see volatility, you know, to get to that point where they are bigger or sustainable contributors to the bottom line.","","Jeffrey C. Sprecher ","Well that\u2019s the very good question and I think the answer to that is going to be better known as we move through the year, and the reason I say that is that we obviously for those that live in the United States particularly in the Midwest and Northeast have seen extreme cold weather this winter, which has driven natural gas volatility and expanded a lot of trading.","And our customers were telling us over the last few years that it was hard to know whether the bases\u2019 location where trading was happening would respond to an extreme volatility condition, given the movement away from historical areas of producing natural gas, and I don\u2019t have any anecdotal information just yet. This is all happening, you know, these moves up have been relatively short in duration, but what we are going to need to do is survey the customer base over the spring time, and really find out whether their winter hedging strategies work for them. And that\u2019s what's going to drive the uptake. Again we are positioning ourselves as if that is a likely outcome but I don\u2019t know the answer to it yet.","Kenneth Worthington \u2013 JP Morgan ","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Niamh Alexander of KBW. Please go ahead.","","Unidentified Analyst ","","Hi, this is actually [Indiscernible]. I am stepping in for Niamh. I just had a question on energy RPC. So this has been declining pretty meaningfully over the past six months or so, and you acknowledged in your prepared remarks that it's been impacted due to strengthen in former OTC products, which is natural gas, so I guess my first question is, you know, is the decline in RPC completely related to volume mix or there are other underlying market dynamics we should be thinking about? And then secondly, could you describe your appetite to re-evaluate fees or pricing tiers?","","Scott A. Hill","Yes, so I will take that. Effectively, the largest driver of RPC decline over the past couple of quarters had been -- has been mixed. There has particularly as natural gas volumes have picked up towards the end of the year and continued into January that impacted the RPC and over the course of the year to a lesser extent, the growth in power volumes and the shift towards the smaller power contracts, which are at a lower rate has impacted rates of contract.","So there is always a number of moving pieces inside the rate of contract but the largest driver of the decline has been strictly mix. Just as an example I took a quick look at January revenues given that volumes were down and the rates had declined a little bit on the energy side. And I actually even despite the volume declines and some of the RPC erosion, January revenues were roughly flat versus where we were a year ago. So it's not really impacting revenue and as we have always said, revenue ultimately is what becomes profit for us, and that\u2019s where we manage not on the mix and, you know, to directly answer your second question, I don\u2019t really see any need to go back and revisit the rates or tiers at this point.","I think that the market making programs that we have in place are working. You know, the other point that I would make to you is as we see in typically volatile time, you do tend to see a little bit higher participation from those who have been at the market making programs, which also affects RPC. So I think we are pretty comfortable to where our pricing fits, and I think we are pretty comfortable with the revenue generation that we are getting out of the trading volumes we are seeing, and I think we like the open interest trend as we look towards the rest of the year. ","Unidentified Analyst ","All right. Thanks Scott. It was helpful.","Operator","","Our next question is from Alex Kramm of UBS. Please go ahead.","Alex Kramm \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","","Hi, good morning. I just wanted to talk about the cost guidance a little bit on the trajectory as we go through, step through the year, I think Scott, you said at the end of Q1, you already have 20 realized and I think at the end of 2014 you are looking for 70% which I think is 350 if my math is correct, so that leaves us basically 130 million for the remainder of the year. So does that mean in the fourth quarter we should be at around 430 million, 440 million run rate in the fourth quarter, and it maybe how do we get there, is it pretty continuous or are there certain big projects that might bring a big drop in let us say the third quarter, for example. ","Scott A. Hill ","Yes, that\u2019s a really good question. I appreciate you asking it because I think it's important to make sure we are not being too subtle in our guidance. So the 220 number is basically the first quarter guidance we gave you, that 220 is locked in and done. It is basically the 108 that we had realized through the end of the year plus then the full year affect of the balance sheet revaluation, a number of senior executive departures at the end of the year at NYX, some clearing synergies that we get \u2013 where they were clearing expenses [Indiscernible] in the first half of \u201913 that won\u2019t repeat in 2014. So effectively in that guidance we gave you for the quarter, that 220 is locked in and done, and then you asked your math, it's exactly right. 70% of the 500 get you to 350. The important part to note about that though is there is a lot of work to be done to get those synergies out.","That\u2019s integrating the Liffe platform, it's integrating our accounting systems, our finance systems, it is doing the heavy lifting around closing like Liffe US and shifting those products. Those are going to take time. And so I would \u2013 I was going to say caution you, I would tell you, you should not take 130 million and assume we are going to realize that in the year on an absolute basis, we will clearly get to that on a run rate. And so the way I think about it is with the first quarter it is the run rate for next year. What does it need to be in terms of overall expenses and that\u2019s really how I think you ought to look at it. So as you get to first quarter next year, that full additional 130 ought to be out of the run rate but it's not going to show up inside 2014. In fact I would tell you, my expectation is, maybe we see 15 million to 20 million yield out of that 130 in the year.","Alex Kramm \u2013 UBS Investment Bank"," ","Okay that make sense. So -- but other than that, it's fairly steady than you would say, very year-end loaded, I guess --","Scott A. Hill","No, yes, I think you again you said it right. It's going to be fairly steady through the first couple of quarters, you know, in line with where we have got it now, you know, as we are kind of mixing in investment to generate the synergies and people leaving and getting costs out. And then as you get to the third quarter, you will start to see a little bit of improvement, as you get to fourth quarter, you will see a little bit more but all the actions will then yield a full quarter\u2019s benefit as you roll into first quarter of 2015. So, I think you are thinking about the exact right away.","Alex Kramm \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","Perfect. Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Allen of Evercore. Please go ahead. ","Christopher J. Allen \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.","Good morning guys.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Good morning.","Christopher J. Allen \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.","I wanted to ask about the operating margin evolution chart in the deck. I am just wondering what if any revenue assumptions are built in there, and what is the \u2013 what will be the potential upside, and in terms of maybe a better operating environment than what we are currently seeing?","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","I thought it was pretty good that we had ourselves already back to 60% in two years. That notwithstanding, we didn't assume any revenue growth. So, this is very much, it is exactly what the charts say. We were at 42 when we announced the deal, we were at 45 when we gave you an update that the deal was closed. If you look at our divestitures, those businesses alone, I mean, it's not, you know, we gave you a guidance that, you don't have this kind of a mid-30s margin and we gave you EBITDA on NYX \u2013 or NYSE technologies, you know, 17%, but frankly on an operating income basis, it only makes a little bit of money, and so it is even lower, so you pull those businesses out, you are looking at 48 to 49, and then from there, it's executing on synergies.","And again, you know, if you just take the map Alex did the 350 and then the 450 and then the 500, it runs you right through the margin. Importantly though Chris, as I said in our remarks, we are going to continue to invest to grow revenue, right. So, you know, one thing as we got the synergies coming out, we are anticipating, we are going to invest 40 to 50 million bucks this year to generate revenue growth. Now clearly if the revenue doesn\u2019t show up, we will dial back on that but we certainly would intend to invest. You know, if you just take the numbers that I gave you in my prepared remark, you know, 40 to 50 of expense, the 100 to 140 of revenues, that gives, you know, incremental margins of 50% to 70% which are right in line with what we are seeing here. So maybe a little upward help, but not far off what we are guiding to. But this chart specifically didn't assume anything on revenue. ","Christopher J. Allen \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.","Got it. Thanks guys. ","Operator","Our next question is from Mike Carrier, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Mike Carrier \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks guys. Jeff, maybe just a question on, you know, the \u2013if anything about the core, you know, energy, oil and nat gas, so when you think about the outlook, you know, in those product areas, I know, you know, in the past, you used to give, you know, some data points on the number of products, the number of users, you know, like what the demand was. I am just, you know, curious because there is a lot of kind of gives and takes in both of those markets right now. But when you think about the outlook over the next couple of years, you look at, you know, what's happening on, you know, the user level versus demand by customers, and you guys innovating new products and then obviously volatility, but that is a much tougher one to gauge, but you know, more on the product and the user side, you know, just what trends are you seeing, what do you expect, you know, for those areas of the business?","Scott A. Hill ","Well, that's a good question, I think you know, for us good news is that we continue to track -- we continue to have an upward track on number of logins, on request per user IDs, on access to data products and that has been, you know, kind of unwavering all through the financial crisis, and it's something that we have come to almost expect around here because it's been so consistently good.","And I know some of our peers from looking at their numbers, just we haven't seen that in some of our peers, but at ICE anyway, we continued to see forward-looking metrics that allow us, as Scott said, to plan for future growth. You couple that with open interest trends that we look at, particularly in certain of our products where open interest is a very good predictor of future volume.","That's not the case in all products but in some of our products, that does seem to be pretty highly correlated. So, a we sit here today, we are \u2013 you know, feeling positive about 2014 just in our core business, in our predicting growth, in our predicting that we are going to continue to invest in those business in order to continue to foster and build out that growth.","But, you know, it's interesting, the market as I said in my prepared remark, you know, is becoming more complicated. You know, we change the brent futures contract on the fly. I don't know that this has ever been done before, you know, we change the expiration of a contract that had open interest in it. And brent like all commodity futures contract has a time component to its valuation, and that time component is particularly manifest in the options market, which is very highly time sensitive, and so sliding that contract forward by a couple of weeks was a material change and one that we didn't even know if it was possible to do, and we could really pull it off, until we completed it.","And so there was a lot of noise around brent. So, yes, we look at it and it continues to grow and do really well. We have right now a lot of noise around our gas oil contract. Gas oil requirements in Europe are reducing the sulfur content and again, we are working with the industry, who has massive open interest, not just in our futures contract but also in a lot of forwards and swap contracts that are, you know, the bread-and-butter of their physical business. And we are trying to move the industry along to a lower sulfur contract. So, you know, I say that because our markets are not just as predictable as you would imagine.","There are - there are always headwinds and volatility issues and things. But the parts of the market that we have visibility into look very good to us, and we are, you know, knock on wood, we are very fortunate and proud of being in the position that we are in, and just to kind of add to that merger with the other question, that's about open interest in the new product. I mean the other oil product that we got, open interest in those products, at the end of the fourth quarter was two times where we were two years ago and was up, you know, give or take a little bit, 10% to 15% from where we were a year ago. So, a lot of the demand for trading the data that Jeff talked about, we are seeing it, not just in brent and gas oil but also in the other oil products that we have launched over the past few years. ","Mike Carrier \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Our next question is from Jillian Miller of BMO Capital, please go ahead.","Jillian Miller \u2013 BMO Capital","Thanks guys. Just want to get an update on your progress with interest rate swap clearing in Europe. Just wondering what you had been working on there like how that client reception has been and when we should expect a rollout of that and I guess related to that, I want to see what current expectation is for when client clearings actually going to become mandatory under [Indiscernible], I think the last time you said, you are expecting early 2015 --","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","All right, well, let me take the first half. This is Jeff, Jillian. Let me take the first half of the other question. Obviously we are working on a broad based interest rate strategy here now, that we moved into that market and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks we have launched the swap note contract, we are very focused on the OTC market as they relate to our particular franchise, we are \u2013 maybe a nuance, but we are moving \u2013 we are taking the Liffe US products and we are moving them to the UK.","We are putting all of our products together in one environment so that we can get them in the benefits of cross margining and correlation, which we think is going to be very beneficial for our customers and we have certainly seen our competitors have benefited from \u2013 in this space from where they have been able to offer great cross margining benefit so there is a lot yet to be built out, and to a certain degree we have one arm tied behind our back because we do need to get off of all of the old Liffe technology, and on to our technology in order for us to, really be able to put the pedal to the metal in terms of and the way we roll things out here. In other words, we don't want to roll out too much on the old technology and then force people to change. So that has also covered the kind of product we are working on and the rate of introduction that we have planned. Let me ask Scot to --","Scott A. Hill","Sure, yes. So, Jillian I feel that the best information I have got is still that the EU buy-side will become mandatory sometime in 2015. I guess the interesting thing I would note though is we have launched a number of European indexes for buy-side clients and ICE Cleared Credit, and I looked at the data for January yesterday, and the notional volume, that we have cleared for the buy-side client each week in January on average, has been, you know, somewhere between 30% and 50% higher than what we saw an average week all last year.","And that even includes when we were moving into the cap two customers and the cap three customers and the spikes around those. So, and as you peel it back, what we are starting to see, if there are some European customers who are clearing through US Clearing Members into ICE Clear Credit, so that they can get access to the clearing. So, we have launched buy-side clearing in Europe. We are hopeful that as it comes in 2015, we will start to see a pickup in volume there but we are seeing some interesting trends in ICE Clear Credit around European CDS embassies that already indicate that you got European customers who are clearing, and it really has led to a fast start to the year for that business. ","Our credit revenues in January were very solid, and you know, even coming off the year where, you know, $60 million of revenue become $80 million of revenue. You know, I am hopeful that we can push that closer to 90 as we go through this year.","Jillian Miller \u2013 BMO Capital","Okay. Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question is from Dan Fannon of Jefferies, please go head.","Dan Fannon \u2013 Jefferies","Thanks. You know, Scott just looking at the slide 22 in the debt structure, you guys obviously have a lot of flexibility with cash flow, but just thinking about, you know, looking into 2015, should we expect much delivering ahead of the maturity of the 5.375 notes or should we expect like kind of cash building up till then or kind of gives us a bit of road map.","Scott A. Hill","Yes. That's a really good question. I think I will focus you on, on slide 22, as in 2016, you see the little dotted bar that says CP 1.80 billion, that basically reflects when the back stop would turn out. We \u2013 you know, our current back stop facility on the CP, the revolver, would turn out in 2016. But that CP is repayable right now. As are the solid, new bars are term loans outstanding. So, as we generate cash all of that prepayable debt and we really, well, we went to the CP market for two reasons, one, because we knew what the solid cash flows and our desire to deliver, we needed pre-payable debt, and two, you know, I am paying somewhere between 25 and 30 bps in the CP market versus, you know, 2.5% interest on our term loan.","So, it's less expensive financing, it is prepayable financing, and so as we generate cash that's kind of, if you will the first area, where we would look to pay down. And then, you know, to your point that the big, kind of, light blue bar that's out in 2015, that's our Euro bar. And clearly our strategy for repayment of those bonds, will be impacted to some extent, by the timing and the size of the IPOs of Euronext, and, you know, depending on when that flows, you know, we would look to, to either pay that debt down early, or if the penalties were too severe for doing that, you know, I think we set - the euros aside it's a nice natural hedge, we set the euros aside and tell the ratings agencies that money instead of that to pay that down. And I think we are getting that leverage treatment and effectively see our leverage go down mathematically, if not, actually. ","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","And maybe I should mention as a bridge, one thing that I find quite interesting about the debt that Scot has put together to finance our NYSE Euronext acquisition, that it is largely LIBOR-based. And while, there is lot of talk about benchmarks other than LIBOR, the reality is our own experience is that in the markets where we do business LIBOR continues to be the benchmark and it's why are we are very excited to take over the administration and continue to advance the confidence in the market.","Dan Fannon \u2013 Jefferies","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Patrick O'Shaughnessy of Raymond James, please go ahead. ","Patrick O'Shaughnessy \u2013 Raymond James","Hey, good morning. So my question is what the legacy NYSE equities and options businesses, we have seen kind of a slow decline in their market share over the last few quarters. Can you talk about how much of that money has been due to just to integration and still lot of things going on and how much is from the competitive landscape, and that's more importantly, kind of what are your plans going forward to maybe arrest those declines.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher","Well, it's a good question. And, you know, one of the, we are obviously learning a lot about the US and European cash equities markets, as we were going through the integration planning, and one of the things that I can tell you is that, it is very easy to be the market share leader in that space if one chooses to want to be that, A, you can change your rate structure and almost instantaneously the order routing algorithms will give you market share and so, you know, our strategy around here has never been to run the business for market share or bragging rights.","I am absolutely indifferent as to what the market share should be in those businesses. I am completely focused on what our revenue capture is and how we can maximize the shareholder value around those businesses while we provide good services to customers so. You have seen our influence over -- on some of the rate design and it does flow through and it's reflected in market share. We continue to look at that every week, almost and we watch our competitors moving around, and we, you know, are very aware of what flow is going where, so -- so it is a calculated decision so far, on our part. Patrick O'Shaughnessy \u2013 Raymond James","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is a follow up from Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill, please go ahead.","Richard Repetto \u2013 Sandler O'Neill ","Yeah. Hi, just a quick follow-up on the tax rate Scott, so the guidance I guess 27% to 30%, I thought it was a bit low when you initially -- in the initial presentations and stuff. ","Scott A. Hill","Well, we haven\u2019t guided on the tax rate, but I think people assume, if you blended the prior NYX tax rate, and the ICE tax rate, that it would and it was a reasonable assumption, you know, by the way. That it would dip below our low end because I think they reported something around the 24%, 25% level. You may have noticed Rich because I know you pay attention to the details, in the quarter we had a lot of noise in our tax rate.","I mean, we mentioned a number of foreign tax impacts and what we are seeing particularly in Continental Europe is we are seeing countries increase corporate tax rates, so as opposed to the UK, we are down, down, down, down, down, and Continental Europe we have seen an example recently in France, where it went from 36% to 38%. In addition to that, there is legislation that in Continental Europe, that really is attacking certain tax planning strategies that were in place at NYX. Again, it is very legitimate, very common tax paying strategy, they are just under a lot of pressure right now on the continent and so frankly if they had remained a standalone company, their tax rate bias was significantly up based on those factors and we have kind of been able to get in and evaluate those impacts particularly again some things happened as recently this December on the tax rates increases.","It's become apparent to us that it's more likely that we are going to stay in a similar tax range even on a combined basis. I will note though Rich that that is why we have Euronext as a part of the group after the IPO is let out, I would expect that to drift back towards the low end of the range. ","Richard Repetto \u2013 Sandler O'Neill","So Euronext actually causes the blended tax rate to be higher that is what you are saying?","","Scott A. Hill ","That's where most of our continental business is, yes."," ","Richard Repetto \u2013 Sandler O'Neill","Okay. That is helpful, Scott. Thank you.","","Operator","The next question is from Alex Kramm of UBS, please go ahead.","","Alex Kramm \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","Hi, quick follow up on the text business of two things, and I don\u2019t if I have missed it but can you just give us an update where you are with selling some of those pieces. It sounds like, you know, given the uncertainty that has been over the last couple of years this business has been fairly stead declined. So just I want to see what the appetite is and where the appetite is coming from and then related to this, Scott, I think you gave the trailing 12 months revenue but can you just give us the maybe fourth quarter run rate for revenue in that business, and maybe what you expect the discontinued earnings to be in the first quarter from that? Thanks.","","Jeffrey C. Sprecher ","So Alex I will take the first part of your question. This is Jeff. Amazingly strong interest in the market to acquire those businesses where we [a banker] and we are in the process and I have signed confidentiality agreements that people are working through and there just been, you know, dozen and dozens and dozens of inbound request to participate in the progress.","So we are very pleasantly surprised. I think these are fundamentally good businesses for some people just not for us at this moment in time. So -- and they are businesses that we don\u2019t fully understand, and I don\u2019t think the skill sets of the company as it's been reorganized particularly caters to operating those businesses right now. We may -- we may regret someday not owning them, but we have got to run the businesses for the benefit of our customers and shareholders, and I think we are just the wrong owner right now. But there are a lot of people that I think would be very good owners and fortunately they have shown up and are taking a hard look at the business. ","","Scott A. Hill ","Yes, and just to answer the last part of the question, so roughly speaking, the NYSE technology businesses, the revenues that we kind of see on a run rate basis if you will into 2014 are a little more than 100 million. Expenses are just little less than 100 million on a starting point. We actually, as you may recall, we had some synergies in our $500 million bucket that we were counting on, and we have actually ended 220, I talked about 40 of that relate to the NYSE technologies business because we have already taken action \u2013 while Jeff is absolutely correct there are some very valuable business.","There were also some businesses that weren\u2019t making money and we shut those down and we have rationalized resources, and so we have already taken some action that would result, will result in synergies over the course of years. Those synergies we will be sitting down and discussed, but you will see them. So as a starting point, I tell you again revenue a little above 100, expenses a little less than 100, which would suggest a somewhat negligible impact to profit. But you should see that profit expand, you know, depending on how long we retain those businesses in that [Indiscernible] line as those synergies start to flow through.","Jeffrey C. Sprecher ","And let me finalize by saying and I hope it's not lost on you that -- we are selling a couple of specific businesses that we think are very good businesses that would be better owned by others. We are also internalizing some of the businesses that existed in that segment, prior segment and those will just be part of our typical ICE reporting segment. So you won\u2019t see them as a technology segment per se but that doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t good businesses, and that we don\u2019t want them. We do.","And then there are certain businesses that are much more closely affiliated with Euronext that are part of the perimeter of the new Euronext that we are defining for which we think we will be appreciated and valued in the IPO of Euronext, and for which I think will benefit the ICE shareholders through that process. So it's really a reorganization of the technology division in various places that we think will maximize value and also allow us to serve customer needs better.
